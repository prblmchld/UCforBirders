        "Body_Content": "<p>The food a bird eats, and the way it obtains it, not only defines its place in the environment and its role in the ecosystem, but also shapes its physical features. It is such a powerful force that unrelated birds can develop similar beaks and feet if they utilise the same food – a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.</p><p>Abdim’s Stork eats mainly large insects, particularly grasshoppers, locusts and corn crickets; it is usually seen striding slowly through open grasslands and fallow lands in search of these items. In this respect, it is a typical stork, with long legs and a long, pointed bill, both of which are adaptations to finding and securing food. The beak is of a generalised design, suitable for grabbing (rather than stabbing) scorpions, frogs, lizards and mice, in addition to insects, and holding them securely at a safe distance from the stork’s head until they can be dispatched and swallowed. Abdim’s Stork forages primarily on land (seldom in water), and is frequently associated with cleared areas in Miombo and northern Kalahari woodland. It has become well adapted to ploughed and fallow lands where prey is easily seen.</p><p>Abdim’s Stork eats mainly large insects, particularly grasshoppers, locusts and corn crickets; it is usually seen striding slowly through open grasslands and fallow lands in search of these items.

It has become well adapted to ploughed and fallow lands where prey is easily seen.</p><p>Abdim’s Stork is a non-breeding migrant to southern Africa from its breeding grounds in the Sahel region. Freed of the constraints of breeding, they are highly mobile, moving in response to spatial and temporal surfeits of food. They typically occur in relatively small flocks, since their prey items are sparsely dispersed throughout the environment, conferring little advantage to having many birds together, competing for each food item. However, where food is concentrated, such as at termite emergences, locust swarms or army worm outbreaks, the storks congregate in large numbers. At night, when roosting, they festoon tall trees such as eucalypts. Food availability is related to climatic events, and the little storks are masters at following rain fronts to arrive just as insect populations are burgeoning. Enormous flocks of over 5 000 individuals have been recorded at various localities during the past few decades.</p><p>Foraging takes place during early mornings and late afternoons; birds rest in the shade during the midday heat, but flocks also soar to a great height in order to cool down. Like other storks, they purposefully and accurately defecate (more correctly excrete dilute urine) onto their legs as an unconventional (for us!) but effective way of evaporative cooling.</p><p>Abdim’s Storks arrive in southern Africa from October, coinciding with the early summer rains, but arrivals peak during November and December. They are present throughout the northern parts of southern Africa until the end of summer. When migrating, they fly only during the day, stopping at staging areas to feed and rest. Nevertheless they cover vast distances, for example, an individual ringed in Harare was recovered almost 3 000 kilometres away in Cameroon a mere three weeks later.</p><p>Since Abdim’s Stork breeds extralimitally, we never get to see this important aspect of its life history. It nests colonially in trees in the Sahel, where it is a common breeding bird in many settlements in this region. There are records of nests being built on hut roofs in African villages, and because it arrives at the onset of the rains, it is viewed with great affection by local people. Here it is the African equivalent of the White Stork, with similar associated superstitions and values. Perhaps because it is a visitor to our region, we do not hold it in similar high esteem in southern Africa, which is a pity because traditional beliefs often confer some degree of protection – something large birds need in a world crowded by people.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Acacia Pied Barbet’s nasal, toy-trumpet ‘pehp’ call is a familiar sound in most regions. Examination of old bird lists, written references and atlas records, have shown that it is much more widespread and numerous now than it was at the beginning of the 20th century. It is thought that the growth of introduced trees (especially Australian Acacia species and other softwoods such as poplars) in otherwise treeless areas has aided its expansion through the provision of tree trunks and branches in which it could excavate nest sites.</p><p>The Pied Barbet is often encountered as a single bird, but another unseen individual is often nearby, for breeding pairs tend to remain together throughout the year. They are not as social as other barbets, nor as noticeably noisy, though the nasal ‘pehp’ call, repeated several times whenever uttered, is loud and far-carrying. Another, quieter call is a soft ‘boop, boop, boop...’, the single syllable repeated from 3 to 15 times (or even more on occasions), followed by a pause, and then another string of ‘boop’s, and so on. The use of this call by Pied Barbets seems restricted to the breeding season, and two birds often vie with each other. One of them may be visible on a high perch – a dead twig at the top of a tree, or the top of a rock jutting above the surrounding vegetation. I saw one on a rock in the Little Karoo, and it and an unseen bird responding to it (from about 50 m away) went on calling for some ten minutes. Several observers have noted that the ‘boop’ of the Pied Barbet’s call is similar to the ‘hoop’ of the African Hoopoe’s call, and the pattern – the repeated strings of notes – is very like that of the Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird.</p><p>The Pied Barbet is often encountered as a single bird, but another unseen individual is often nearby, for breeding pairs tend to remain together throughout the year.

Pied Barbets enjoy a range of other fruits, including the berries of the non-indigenous Pittosporum tree in my garden, but they inexplicably ignore the nearby African Peach Kiggelaria africana fruits with their bright orange arils, which a host of other birds delight in eating. Our local pair of Pied Barbets also surprised us each winter by coming to the bird tray every morning and tossing back birdseed, to the consternation of sparrows and weavers, which they ignored.</p><p>One bird they don’t ignore, however, is the Lesser Honeyguide. This brood parasite has expanded its range comparatively recently by following the Pied Barbet into the fynbos region of the Western Cape. Pied Barbets are aggressive towards Lesser Honey&#173;guides whenever they encounter one, irrespective of the time of year, but especially when breeding. The barbets defend their nest hole vigorously but usually in vain, as the honeyguides have developed their own behaviour patterns to counter the barbet defences.</p><p>Pied Barbets are double-brooded, and young birds may start to breed at the age of seven months. Breeding pairs roost in their nest holes, but group roosting has not been reported. Interestingly, Pied Barbet pairs have been observed roosting (and in a few cases even breeding) in the enclosed nests of weavers and Greater-striped Swallows. This versatility of behaviour and reproductive effort may well underpin the ongoing expansion of this attractive barbet.  &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Barred Owlet occurs mainly in the more northern parts of southern Africa, and its range extends from here across much of sub-Saharan Africa, represented in different regions by a number of distinctively different subspecies, some restricted to lowland forest, others to moist woodlands.</p><p>Its distribution in southern Africa is especially interesting because of the presence here of a tiny, isolated, subspecifically distinct population of the bird found in the Eastern Cape between Grahamstown and Kenton-on-Sea; these birds are separated by some 800 kilometres from those occurring further north, the range of which starts in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The first African Barred Owlets known to science were these Kenton-on-Sea birds, hence the scientific name capense, yet between their discovery in 1834 and their rediscovery here in 1980, they remained unknown, and even today they have been seen by very few people. They are darker brown birds than their northern counterparts, have less distinctly barred wings, spotted rather than barred heads, narrower banding on their tails, and their call is somewhat slower. Little is known about them other than that they inhabit the dense Euphorbia thickets that cloak the hills and valleys close to the sea.</p><p>Its distribution in southern Africa is especially interesting because of the presence here of a tiny, isolated, subspecifically distinct population of the bird found in the Eastern Cape between Grahamstown and Kenton-on-Sea; these birds are separated by some 800 kilometres from those occurring further north, the range of which starts in northern KwaZulu-Natal.

Little is known about them other than that they inhabit the dense Euphorbia thickets that cloak the hills and valleys close to the sea.</p><p>Better known are the African Barred Owlets that occur widely across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and northern Botswana. Here they are found in mature woodland and along the wooded fringes of all the larger rivers; they are especially numerous in the innumerable braided channels fringed by woodland in the Okavango Delta and, even if the birds are not seen, their distinctive call is heard here on a daily basis. These owlets are superficially similar in appearance to the Pearl-spotted Owlet but are larger, barred rather than spotted on their heads, and they have boldly spotted, not streaked underparts. In places the two occur alongside each other but mostly the difference in their preferred habitats prevents much overlap. Both species are less strictly nocturnal than other owls, and African Barred Owlets often call in the early morning and late afternoon, as well as during the night.</p><p>Two calls are commonly used, one a series of a dozen or so mellow purring notes  ‘wirow, wirow, wirow...’, about two per second, which are uttered at a constant pitch. The other, a call that may continue from the first is a two-syllable, more rolling note a ‘prr-purr, prr-purr’, also repeated in quick succession. The birds are usually to be found in the mid-canopy branches of large trees, and they hunt by scanning the ground below for movement. Much of their diet comprises arthropods, including beetles, crickets, moths, mantids and caterpillars, and they are known to take small rodents, dormice, small snakes, lizards and frogs. They have smaller talons than the Pearl-spotted Owlet and are less rapacious, so birds seldom feature among their prey.</p><p>In contrast to the Pearl-spotted Owlet, their larger size mostly prevents them from making use of woodpecker holes for breeding and instead they use rot holes in tree trunks for this purpose, usually at a site where a branch has broken off, and usually less than about five metres up from the ground. Not a great deal is known of their nesting habits beyond that they lay a clutch of 2-3 eggs in early summer and it is thought that, in common with other owls, only the female incubates. The nesting cycle lasts about two months from laying to fledging. Everywhere African Barred Owlets are worthy of research attention, none more so than the isolated Eastern Cape population. Who knows, perhaps DNA from this population would even reveal it to be a separate species.&#9;</p>",

It gives the impression of being essentially very dark grey or black in colour but has white speckles on the back. The word sparsa means ‘speckled’ and is a good description of the bird’s back. In flight the bird shows a dark green speculum, with a white line above and below the green colour. When out of the water, the orange legs and feet are conspicuous. One of the interesting features of this species is that the female often quacks in flight but the male has a high-pitched peeping whistle.</p><p>The African Black Duck is found in a broad arc from the Western Cape coast up through the Karoo and Highveld, to Zimbabwe. It is absent from the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. North of our region it is recorded as far as southern Ethiopia.</p><p>The African Black Duck is found in a broad arc from the Western Cape coast up through the Karoo and Highveld, to Zimbabwe. It is absent from the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. North of our region it is recorded as far as southern Ethiopia.</p><p>These are birds of rivers rather than open pans and dams. African Black Ducks may be resident along almost any perennial river or stream, especially where there is vegetation along the banks. They also frequent streams with rapids which have pools between the rapids. They claim a length of river as their territory – as short as 200 metres of river on very productive rivers, to over a kilometre on smaller streams.</p><p>Towards dusk the pair normally flies along their section of the river, with the female leading and quacking loudly as they fly – in the quiet of dusk the quacking sounds particularly loud! They are territorial throughout the year and are very aggressive to other ducks, especially others of the same species flying along the river. I recorded many pairs along most sections of the numerous rivers and streams flowing off the watershed around Marondera where I watched birds for over 40 years.</p><p>Both sexes have a bony knob at the carpal joint (the bend in the wing), which is used to strike other ducks during the fierce territorial fights which occur between territory holders and interlopers. Single birds may occur within territories but keep out of the way of the territorial pair. At dusk they, and often the pair, move to open water to roost in safety in dams or lagoons. It is here that birds seek potential mates and where the full range of courtship displays take place. These gatherings usually increase in numbers immediately after the wing-moult period. Mated pairs move back to their territories at daybreak.</p><p>This species is a strictly monogamous breeder with single nests within territories. The nest is built by the female from grass or other debris, usually in long grass near the river but I have also found nests on flood debris well above water level, and they nest on ledges on river cliffs and on collapsed Hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) nests as well.The nest is well concealed and contains a lot of dark grey downy feathers and some larger feathers, both of which are used to conceal the eggs when the bird leaves. The down may also help to keep the eggs warm as the nest is usually in deep shade. The female does all the incubation and usually leaves the nest morning and afternoon to feed. While she is feeding, the male stations himself near the nest as a lookout. It is noteworthy that the male usually deserts the female towards the end of incubation or after eggs hatch to isolate himself in order to moult his flight feathers.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>For visitors to the coast this is the iconic wader of South Africa and one of our most familiar birds. It breeds from southern Namibia around the coast and on offshore islands east to southern KwaZulu-Natal. Non-breeders move further afield to southern Angola and northern KwaZulu-Natal, occasionally reaching southern Mozambique. That these young birds moved so far only became apparent when a bird ringed as a chick in the Knysna area in December 1996 was recaptured at the saltworks outside Swakopmund, Namibia, in February 1998. This led to a renewed effort to ring young oystercatchers with different coloured engraved rings whose unique letters and numbers could be read in the field with the aid of a telescope. It would appear that a proportion of young, mainly from Knysna westwards, make their way north to nursery areas in Namibia and southern Angola – outside the species’ breeding range – where they may spend as much as the first four years of their lives. However, a proportion of the young only undertake short-distance movements after fledging, remaining well within the breeding range of the adults. These young birds form loose roving flocks that move up and down the coastline, often gathering to feed in estuaries, especially on the south coast, where few adults breed.</p><p>In earlier centuries these birds must have had a very patchy distribution around the coast and were probably confined mainly to islands where they were secure from preda&#173;tors in the form of strandlopers and jackals that scavenged the coastline. Now that these have gone, the oystercatcher has been able to expand its range, especially eastwards, and is continuing to do so. On the Namibian coast, the situation is quite different and jackals are still widespread and common, giving little chance for successful breeding by a bird as conspicuous as this, and with such a long incubation and fledging period. Virtually all breeding birds there are confined to offshore islands and mainland cliffs.</p><p>In earlier centuries these birds must have had a very patchy distribution around the coast and were probably confined mainly to islands where they were secure from preda&#173;tors in the form of strandlopers and jackals that scavenged the coastline.

But for all that, the bird is successful and although the entire population numbers only around 6&#160;500 individuals – this is about 50% higher than previously. But we should not be complacent, as a reversal can occur at any time, especially if food supplies are affected.</p><p>An interesting breeding event took place in early 2002 at Cape Recife, outside Port Elizabeth, when one of two youngsters was found to have a grey plumage rather than the normal black. The chicks were ringed and given uniquely marked, engraved rings, that of the grey bird being T46. This bird was seen in the field several times over the ensuing years both in the vicinity of Sunday’s River mouth and at Cape Recife. It was calling and displaying at Cape Recife in 2007 and, in the following year, was found holding a territory some 11 kilometres east of the Sunday’s River at the Alexandria dune fields. But what surprised us was that he appeared to have two wives. We could not confirm breeding by both females that season as only two young were being reared, but in the following year two nests were found only a few centimetres apart, suggesting that T46 did indeed have two mates, although only one chick survived that season.</p>",

Flocks are particularly vociferous near their nesting colonies, where large groups gather to perform impressive spiralling flights. The birds are often so high up that they would be nearly impossible to spot incidentally if it were not for their ‘betraying’ voices.</p><p>Like its congeners, every aspect of the African Black Swift’s build and lifestyle is modified for flight, and rapid flight at that. Their wings make an impressive, audible sound when rushing close overhead and it has been estimated that these dizzying aerialists can fly up to 1&#160;000 km per day in pursuit of prey. They usually cling, bat-like, to vertical surfaces, the only form of ‘perching’ allowed by their weak feet and four, forward-pointing toes. If one is accidentally grounded, it will shuffle awkwardly about before rolling onto its side and bringing its free wing down to lift its body into the air and take flight again.</p><p>Like its congeners, every aspect of the African Black Swift’s build and lifestyle is modified for flight, and rapid flight at that.

If one is accidentally grounded, it will shuffle awkwardly about before rolling onto its side and bringing its free wing down to lift its body into the air and take flight again.</p><p>Their diet consists almost exclusively of flying arthropods, collectively described as ‘aerial plankton’. This prey spectrum includes beetles, termites, ants, bees, flies and any other suitably-sized insect or arachnid that can be caught on the wing. When feeding chicks, adults temporarily store hundreds of insects in their throats, bound together with saliva into a bolus, or food ball, giving them the appearance of having a distended throat. Foraging birds are quick to exploit temporary food surpluses such as flying termite emergences or the waves of insects flushed before grass fires.</p><p>The African Black Swift breeds solitarily or colonially; in the latter case, colonies may be shared with Alpine Swifts. It is predominantly a cliff-nester, although it has been recorded breeding in deep cracks in tree trunks in East Africa. Not surprisingly, given its partiality to cliffs for breeding purposes, it is mainly restricted to mountainous and alpine regions when breeding. Most colonies are 1 600 to &#173;&#173;</p><p>2 400 metres above sea level. However, some breed at lower altitudes, and a few colonies are even located in cracks in coastal cliffs that are occasionally splashed with sea spray. Suitable nesting cliffs range in height from tens to hundreds of metres, and have caves, cracks or overhangs. Granitic cliffs are apparently avoided. Although they are not known to breed on buildings, bridges and other man-made structures, quarry walls are sought after as colony locations.</p><p>The nest itself is a sturdy pad constructed of materials collected on the wing, including floating plant down, small grass blades, feathers and other natural debris. Saliva is used to glue the nest to the rock wall. Two elongated plain white eggs are laid, but the incubation and nestling periods remain unknown.</p><p>Despite its local abundance, the movements and distribution of the African Black Swift are poorly understood, partly due to the difficulty of reliably identifying fast-flying swifts amongst the clouds. It is primarily a seasonal breeding visitor with at least a proportion of the South African nominate population vacating their breeding haunts from May to August. These birds are believed to pass through northern Botswana and Zimbabwe en route to unknown wintering grounds in tropical Africa. Other populations, such as the paler A. b. hollidayi of the Victoria Falls area and the smaller and darker A. b. oreobates of eastern Zimbabwe, are mainly resident. It is uncertain whether the African Black Swift breeds in Namibia at all. Taxonomically, it is equally perplexing – many authorities believe that A. b. balstoni from Madagascar and the Comoros is a different species (Malagasy Black Swift); similar sentiments apply to A. b. sladeniae from West Africa (Fernando Po Swift). &#9;</p>",

But Africa’s own three broadbills are remarkably dull-looking, inactive birds. They frequent the lower parts of the vegetation well within forest and deciduous thicket when in leaf. Our bird is not shy, tolerating approach to within a few metres. It just sits and looks at you and will stay put for several minutes. When it takes flight, it flies fast and, like other forest birds, it has an uncanny ability to avoid all the flight hazards which seem likely to impede its path. The black cap of the male is a distinguishing feature, but you may not see the white patch that both sexes have on their back because it is only the base of those feathers that are white.</p><p>Despite dullness and inactivity, however, they are not the nonentities of their forest habitat because they have a unique display flight. This is usually heard in the early morning and at dusk. But in the earlier summer months when they start breeding, they perform at intervals throughout the day. The bird chooses a perch about chest high in a relatively open area. Then it will suddenly execute a quick, short, circular flight. This is done at the height of the perch in level flight, during which it completes a circle some two metres across and goes back to its starting point. While doing its thing, it puffs up the white patch on its back and makes a peculiar loud noise. That noise is made only when it flies its circle, and it makes the noise every time it flies its circle. Each ‘brrrrrup’ lasts nearly a second. It starts suddenly, slows down a bit and then rises and speeds up before a sudden cut-off. It sounds like a protracted croak. Half a dozen such ‘brrrrrup’ performances may be followed by a break of a minute or two.</p><p>Despite dullness and inactivity, however, they are not the nonentities of their forest habitat because they have a unique display flight. This is usually heard in the early morning and at dusk. But in the earlier summer months when they start breeding, they perform at intervals throughout the day. The bird chooses a perch about chest high in a relatively open area. Then it will suddenly execute a quick, short, circular flight. This is done at the height of the perch in level flight, during which it completes a circle some two metres across and goes back to its starting point. While doing its thing, it puffs up the white patch on its back and makes a peculiar loud noise. That noise is made only when it flies its circle, and it makes the noise every time it flies its circle. Each ‘brrrrrup’ lasts nearly a second. It starts suddenly, slows down a bit and then rises and speeds up before a sudden cut-off. It sounds like a protracted croak. Half a dozen such ‘brrrrrup’ performances may be followed by a break of a minute or two.</p><p>For years the big question was: “How is that noise made?”  Is it vocal or mechanical – or a bit of both?  Roberts VII offers no answer. The same question arises with regard to the African Pitta which also makes a distinctive croaky noise as it parachutes down on fast-fluttering wings from its vertical display jump. In both cases the sound is quite different from that made by any other bird and can carry for well over a hundred metres. It probably serves the dual purpose of proclaiming a territory and advertising suitability and availability for mating.</p><p>All this leads to the major division within the Passeriformes(the order of perching birds,which account for half the bird families in the world) between suboscines and oscines. Most of the suboscine birds occur in South America where they are abundant. In Africa the only suboscines are the pittas and the broadbills. A distinguishing feature of the suboscines is that the muscle structure of the syrinx – a bird’s voice box – is simpler and more primitive than that of the oscine songbirds. It can be argued, therefore, that the strange noises made by pittas and broadbills are vocal and strange due to the limitations of their syrinx. Therefore, the sounds are likely vocal, not mechanical.</p><p>Flappet Larks and Clapper Larks make physical sounds with their wings. Pigeons strike their wings together. Snipe make their drumming sound with their tail feathers. And the Dowsetts have established that our broadbills make their noise through the twisted outer primaries – main flight feathers – of their wings. But have they excluded a concurrent vocal component?  Apparently neither the pittas nor the broadbills of the Orient make these mechanical sounds.</p>",

A summer visitor it is, but it is doubtless underrecorded because so many people do not recognise it. Most sightings are of birds that give you a fright by flushing at your feet, flying away and then dropping back into the grass before you can get it in focus with your binoculars. It is a terrestrial bird that likes to live under a cover of grass on dry to damp ground, but not ground under water.</p><p>It is its call that reveals its presence. Often the first sign of its arrival is the way it calls, almost like a scattered flock of a few European Bee-eaters flying overhead.  One hears this call in the evening before Christmas, just a single ‘kerek’, or a couple of ‘kerek-kereks’, but answered by another bird. A couple of minutes later the call comes down again from the dark, as others are flying over at no great height. They are reported to establish their pair bonds in their winter quarters in coastal East Africa, so they arrive already paired and ready to breed.</p><p>It is its call that reveals its presence.

They are reported to establish their pair bonds in their winter quarters in coastal East Africa, so they arrive already paired and ready to breed.</p><p>Within a week or two they are to be seen taking short, sixty-metre flights above the grass tops from one part of the grassland to another. These voluntary flights are always accompanied by these calls. But flush them by walking through the grassland, or with a dog, and they have nothing to say at all. The self-induced flight calls seem to be contact calls between pairs. The other call that one commonly hears, particularly morning and evening, is a prolonged series of these ‘kerek-kerek-kerek’ calls uttered from the ground. They start off a bit hesitantly, but soon work up a rhythm a bit quicker than one ‘kerek’ per second, which will continue for some 20&#160;seconds per bout before tailing off. Repeats take place at intervals of about five minutes, and when one bird calls it tends to set off others calling in response. This must be a territorial proclamation for the purposes of establishing spacing between different pairs.</p><p>Nightjars sometimes move their eggs and so do jacanas. The former must just roll them along the ground while jacanas float theirs and push them through the water, but these crakes may also move their eggs to avoid inundation by rising water levels.</p><p>Some time ago I showed a nest to an Iain Sinclair bunch of birders. It was a pad of dry grass in the middle of a grass tussock and was some 30 mm above the general ground level. A week later, after more than 120 mm of rain, the birds had built a new upstairs nest about 25 cm higher up in the same tuft. The original nest was still there and one egg had rolled off into the mud; the other five eggs that had been in the original nest had all been lifted and placed in the new nest. An adult must have carried them up in its beak.</p><p>The nests and eggs of the African Crake and the African Rail are difficult to distinguish in the field. At one time conventional wisdom dictated that nests on the ground were those of the crake and those off the ground were rail nests, but the crake nests are often off the ground, particularly those built early in the season within a small patch of dry grass before the new green grass provides enough cover. Rails’ nests are usually elevated and over stagnant water but may be on a mud island with water all around</p>",

It would appear that it is nowhere common, but it is often overlooked because of its secretive habits. Also, because of its somewhat cuckoo-like appearance it might even be misidentified. It does not fly like a cuckoo, however, and it is probably more likely to be confused with a sparrowhawk. At rest it is best distinguished by its long wings, which reach almost to the tail tip – the folded wings of sparrowhawks are much shorter than the tail.</p><p>African Cuckoo-Hawks have a greyish-brown back and rufous-brown barring on the chest and belly. The head and breast and throat are a grey colour. In flight the bright rufous of the underwings is the most conspicuous field character. Although superficially recalling a sparrowhawk, the African Cuckoo-Hawk is a primitive raptor, usually placed right at the start of the raptor sequence. It is the only African species in the genus Aviceda, with a closely related form on Madagascar and three species in Asia, all known as Bazas.</p><p>African Cuckoo-Hawks have a greyish-brown back and rufous-brown barring on the chest and belly.

However, apart from the breeding season, we were seldom aware of them being there unless we noticed one of them flying silently from one tree to the next. The birds would drop off a perch and fly quite slowly, or glide fairly close to the ground until they swooped up into the next tree and then sat there quietly on a perch. The birds hunted from the perch, dropping down onto a grasshopper or other insect on the lawn, or a gecko or small lizard scurrying from one bit of cover to the next. They would grasp the prey with their feet and immediately fly back up into a tree to eat whatever it was they had caught. Because of their colour and markings they are inconspicuous when sitting in a tree and are therefore easily missed.</p><p>At the beginning of the breeding season the birds start building a new nest, often in an alien tree such as a eucalypt, calling quite loudly to one another at this time with a ‘pee-ou’ call. It has been recorded that one bird goes off to collect live branches which it cuts with its bill and then carries the branch, with leaves still attached, to the other bird which waits at the nest and actually builds the nest. The nest itself is not particularly conspicuous in the large trees chosen for nesting. A nest that I photographed gave me the impression that a good wind would likely shake it out of the eucalypt tree in which it was built. However, the birds successfully fledged two chicks from the nest, so probably it wasn’t as flimsy as it looked.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Cuckoo is very similar in appearance to the European or Common Cuckoo, but it is an intra-tropical migrant that breeds in southern Africa. The birds are dark grey on the back with a grey throat and chest and with a white barred belly. The tail has white bars right across, which are broader than the white lines on the Common Cuckoo’s tail, and the beak has more extensive yellow at the base. Both species have a yellow eye-ring. The Common Cuckoo’s onomatopoeic call is well known because it has been used for generations in the cuckoo clocks of Europe. Rather than descending in pitch on the second note, the African Cuckoo’s call goes up: ‘cuc-CUCK’. Its call is one of the typical sounds of the woodlands of many parts of the northern half of southern Africa. Unlike Dideric Cuckoos, which tend to remain concealed in a tree while calling, African Cuckoos usually call from a conspicuous perch, usually on the highest tree in the area, making the males easy to see. Often the same song post is used year after year, probably by different birds unless the original bird lived for many years.&#160;</p><p>Like most cuckoos, African Cuckoos often eat caterpillars that other birds spurn. Trees with large numbers of caterpillars sometimes attract more than one African Cuckoo. Very large caterpillars are bashed against a branch to pulp them before being swallowed. Hairy caterpillars are usually brushed across a branch to remove the hairs, whereas hairless species are swallowed whole.</p><p>Like most cuckoos, African Cuckoos often eat caterpillars that other birds spurn.

Hairy caterpillars are usually brushed across a branch to remove the hairs, whereas hairless species are swallowed whole.</p><p>In Zimbabwe’s Brachystegia woodlands, the African Cuckoo’s call is heard monotonously for about a month or six weeks in September-October. In this habitat, most birds start breeding in early spring, but the actual start of breeding is determined by the amount of rain in the previous rainy season, and the temperature.  African Cuckoos parasitise Fork-tailed Drongos, and although on average only approximately 1-2% of drongo nests are parasitised, in some areas the proportion exceeds 20% of nests. It is interesting that the cuckoos should choose to parasitise such an aggressive bird but the nesting success of drongos is perhaps better than other birds in the woodlands. The cuckoo is considerably bigger than the drongo, and the baby cuckoo must ensure that it disposes of the drongo chicks if it is to get enough food to survive.&#160;</p><p>Both sexes apparently search for suitable drongo nests, and collaborate to get their egg into the drongo nest. While the male cuckoo distracts the drongos, the female slips onto the nest and in a matter of seconds, lays her egg and removes one of the drongo eggs. Some years ago I watched a drongo build a nest in a well-developed patch of woodland near Marondera, Zimbabwe. A week or so later I noticed that there was a male African Cuckoo calling about 200 metres from the nest. One afternoon I noticed that the cuckoo was much closer, and the drongos immediately flew off towards the calling cuckoo. Although we did not see it happen, it might have been at this moment that the female cuckoo slipped in and laid an egg in the drongo’s nest. Some weeks later I was able to photograph the baby cuckoo overfilling the drongo’s nest.</p><p>Outside the breeding season, African Cuckoos, like most of their kind, are easily overlooked. As a result, knowledge of their movements is limited. This problem is exacerbated in the case of the African Cuckoo, because they are so easily confused with Common Cuckoos. It appears that most African Cuckoos arrive in southern Africa in late August, and depart in March to April, but a few birds apparently overwinter, &#9;</p>",

These characteristics explain their common names. They are called darters because they have long, sinuous necks that enable them to thrust forward their bill to impale prey, aided by a special hinge between their eighth and ninth vertebrae. They are also known as ‘snakebirds’ because of their snake-like appearance when swimming at the water surface. Most of their body is submerged thanks to their low buoyancy, which is enhanced by having denser bones and smaller air sacs than cormorants.</p><p>Low buoyancy saves energy when diving in shallow water. Compared to cormorants, Darters make longer dives (up to almost two minutes) and have shorter rest periods between dives, allowing them to spend more time foraging. Their low buoyancy also allows them to hang motionless in the water and thus use stealth to capture prey. They sometimes use other species to drive fish to them, positioning themselves in front of advancing groups of foraging pelicans.</p><p>Low buoyancy saves energy when diving in shallow water.

Their low buoyancy also allows them to hang motionless in the water and thus use stealth to capture prey. They sometimes use other species to drive fish to them, positioning themselves in front of advancing groups of foraging pelicans.</p><p>The price darters pay for their low buoyancy, is that they lose the insulation provided by a layer of air, and thus are confined to relatively warm areas. Whereas cormorants occur throughout the world, the four darters barely extend outside the tropics. And their foraging trips are short within this restricted range; in the Western Cape they seldom remain in the water for more than 20 minutes before returning to shore to warm up. Like cormorants they then orientate themselves so their backs face the sun and open their wings to maximise the area exposed to its heat.</p><p>The mandibles of African Darters are finely serrated to help secure prey, and they usually spear with their bill tip slightly apart. As a result, small prey is often caught only on the upper mandible. Once caught, the Darter faces the tricky task of freeing the prey item from its bill tip and turning it, to be swallowed head first – no mean feat when handling slippery fish or frogs. This is achieved with a quick flick of the head, tossing up the fish and catching it until it is oriented correctly. However, even experienced birds sometimes drop their prey. And before they swallow a fish they are at risk of losing it to other birds. If approached at this stage, they usually respond by diving.</p><p>Darters forage singly, but often roost in groups, commuting to and from favoured foraging areas. They are accomplished fliers, soaring in thermals on their large, broad wings. Their long, stiff tails also aid in flight, but their primary function is to help keep birds motionless in the water. Darters differ from cormorants in another important respect; they have a flightless moult, replacing all their wing feathers at once. However, their tail feathers are replaced sequentially, emphasising the importance of the tail for diving.</p><p>Darters breed in colonies, usually together with other waterbirds such as cormorants, egrets, herons, ibises and African Spoonbills. They nest in trees, on islands in wetlands, or in large reed beds. They incubate their eggs with their feet, and the chicks, from the age of 10 days, can clamber back into their nests if they are disturbed. African Darters are not threatened, although they are susceptible to being caught in fishing nets. They are widely distributed in southern Africa wherever there are suitable wetlands, but are strangely scarce in Mozambique.</p>",

Were it not for its call, the Dusky Flycatcher would often pass unnoticed, for it is sombrely clad in brown and dull grey and commonly perches low down on a shaded branch.</p><p>From such a vantage point it sallies forth to hawk flying insects with an audible snap of its bill, and usually returns to the same perch. It sometimes gives a wing flick on perching, as does the similar-looking Palaearctic migrant Spotted Flycatcher, but whereas in the latter species wing flicking is the rule, in the Dusky Flycatcher it is an exception. Although field guides stress the absence of a streaked cap as the best way to differentiate Dusky from Spotted Flycatchers, wing length also is a good feature. The Dusky Flycatcher, being largely sedentary, has a shorter, less pointed wing than its migratory counterpart.</p><p>From such a vantage point it sallies forth to hawk flying insects with an audible snap of its bill, and usually returns to the same perch.

The Dusky Flycatcher, being largely sedentary, has a shorter, less pointed wing than its migratory counterpart.</p><p>This bird sometimes joins mixed-species bird parties. Such an association benefits the flycatcher, because other members of the party act as beaters, putting small insects to flight which the flycatcher can then snap up. It has also been observed to have foraging associations with mammals, both wild and domestic, using them as mobile perches from which to hawk prey disturbed by their passage. It sometimes descends to the ground for food, more often in pursuit of flying prey that has sought shelter in the leaf litter, and it sometimes flutters above the spot where the prey landed to frighten it into flight again.</p><p>Flying insects are less apt to fly in the colder months of the year, and although such prey may still be available in the flycatcher’s habitat, its lack of movement makes it more difficult to find. This may be why Dusky Flycatchers are altitudinal migrants, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal, where they flock to the warm coastal region during winter. It is not known from how far inland these winter visitors come, but there is no doubt that they are much more common in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal belt in winter than in summer. One Dusky Flycatcher was even observed on several late afternoons hawking prey from the top of a lamp post in a Durban street, oblivious to the rush-hour traffic passing beneath it.</p><p>Dusky Flycatchers tend to build their nests much higher (up to 12 metres above the ground) than the levels at which they habitually hunt. The small, cup-shaped nest is not always well hidden, but it may be used for several years in succession. When the young birds fledge they form a family group of four or five birds with the parents, and may remain thus until the next breeding attempt. The juveniles are quite distinctive, with their buff-spotted upperparts, mottled breast and bright yellow gape. However, they moult out of this juvenile plumage within a few months of leaving the nest.</p><p>Dusky Flycatchers are sometimes parasitised by Red-chested Cuckoos. I found one such nest built on top of a horizontal branch of a conifer at the edge of a garden. The size of the chocolate brown cuckoo egg looked enormous next to the small greeny-hued flycatcher’s eggs, but the flycatcher continued incubating the clutch nevertheless.&#9;</p>",

It joins two slightly older camaroptera chicks, and huddles together with them for warmth under the brooding mother. Within a day or two, however, the little cuckoo is rested, and although its eyes are still closed, it starts behaving in a most unusual way - constantly backing up against its foster siblings, and pushing against them until eventually, one by one, they are evicted from the nest. Having accomplished this amazing feat, the cuckoo chick rests once again.</p><p>This extraordinary drama has been enacted for millennia, ever since brood parasitism evolved as a way of boosting breeding success of the Old World cuckoos, including the African Emerald Cuckoo. It may have started with birds using old disused nests of other species, or as ‘egg-dumping’ where some females lay their eggs in the nests of conspecifics or even those of other species, but today it is a highly evolved, comprehensive survival strategy for cuckoos. Every detail is taken care of – the female cuckoo removes one of the host’s eggs to compensate for the addition of one of hers; the cuckoo egg matches closely those of the host, although typically it is slightly larger; the cuckoo egg has a relatively short incubation period, ensuring that it hatches before or soon after the host’s eggs, and the cuckoo hatchling (with concave back, strong legs and stubby wings) is designed and programmed to eliminate all competition at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>This extraordinary drama has been enacted for millennia, ever since brood parasitism evolved as a way of boosting breeding success of the Old World cuckoos, including the African Emerald Cuckoo.

Since she does not have to care further for the eggs or young when they hatch, she is able to produce several successive clutches a few days apart, resulting in about 20 eggs per season, considerably boosting her productivity.</p><p>There are only two proven hosts for African Emerald Cuckoos in southern Africa, the Green-backed Camaroptera and Barratt’s Warbler, with the former being the more important (there are only two records of Barratt’s Warbler being parasitised). It is no coincidence that the cuckoo’s distribution throughout the forests and mesic woodlands in the eastern part of southern Africa overlaps with that of the camaroptera quite closely. An obvious discrepancy, though, is Zimbabwe, where the cuckoo is common and the Green-backed Camaroptera absent; here the closely-related Grey-backed Camaroptera probably is the primary host, although Black-throated Wattle-eyes and Ashy Flycatchers also are possible hosts.</p><p>The cuckoos breed in summer after arriving from tropical wintering grounds. Neither the birds nor their breeding habits are easily observed, however. Despite the male’s iridescent green-and-yellow plumage (coppery-brown in the female), they are hard to see as they remain high up in the forest canopy. The best way to see one is to home in on the male’s attractive, three-note ‘pretty geor-gie’ song, which is a characteristic sound in forested areas in summer.</p><p>Emerald Cuckoos are leaf-gleaners, searching the foliage in the middle and upper strata of forests and mature woodland for the caterpillars that comprise the bulk of their diet. They may occur in small groups where there are caterpillar outbreaks. Such aggregations have been recorded in association with other cuckoo species feeding on caterpillars, shedding their skins on the trunk of White Stinkwood Celtis africana trees. There is still much to be learned about this species; it is a challenging subject for study due to the difficulties of observing it undisturbed in its natural habitat. It will require dedication and perseverance to fully document its breeding and movements in southern Africa.</p>",

The quiet pools are essential for the birds to feed because they swim along the edge of the water, picking insects off the vegetation on the side. They may also occur on the lower reaches of rivers with no rapids such as the Kaaimans River in the southern Cape, which flows slowly enough for the birds to be able to swim quietly. It is one of three species of finfoots globally, with the larger Masked Finfoot in south-east Asia and the diminutive Sungrebe in central and South America.</p><p>The African Finfoot has a reputation for being rare but in fact where suitable habitat occurs, it is not rare, merely secretive. They seldom venture into the open, although there has been evidence of a bird in the Kaaimans River sitting in the sun on the concrete causeway below the main road! In some areas they become habituated to man and may then be readily seen. For a number of years a finfoot lived just above the causeway below Skukuza camp in Kruger National Park, where many people were able to sit in their cars on the causeway and watch the bird feeding. Below the deck at Ichingo Lodge on the banks of the Chobe River, a pair of finfoot would regularly walk out of the water and sit quietly on a small beach preening for an hour at a time.</p><p>The African Finfoot has a reputation for being rare but in fact where suitable habitat occurs, it is not rare, merely secretive.

Below the deck at Ichingo Lodge on the banks of the Chobe River, a pair of finfoot would regularly walk out of the water and sit quietly on a small beach preening for an hour at a time.</p><p>With its long, thin neck and sharply pointed bill, the finfoot is approximately the size and shape of a cormorant, or perhaps a darter. However, it is related to the rails and flufftails. The male has a dark grey head and back, whereas the female has a brown head and back, but both birds have a white line running back from the red bill, up through the eye, across the side of the head and down the neck. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this bird is its bright orange legs and feet, with the toes ending in yellow claws. The birds swim with the tail flat on the surface of the water. The tail is kept fanned, and during the two days of observing this species at a nest, I never saw the bird close its tail.</p><p>Finfoot usually nest when rivers are low – it probably needs to avoid flood periods because the chicks wouldn’t cope with fast-flowing water. The nest is normally placed on a horizontal branch over the water. Seen from the side, the nest resembles flood debris which has been thrown up into the tree, albeit at a height above the actual flood debris. The nest consists of bits of stick, reeds and grass and has a well-developed central basin that is not lined with finer material, and the basin is not deep enough to hide the female while she is incubating the eggs. The eggs are remarkably well marked for a water bird, looking very much like the egg of a korhaan: light brown with darker brown spots, mostly at one end. Most water birds lay eggs of a single colour although it might have a few markings.</p><p>The nest where I photographed these birds had a sloping branch leading up from the water to the nest. The female always walked up the branch to the nest, and not once in two days did she fly to the nest. She would walk up until almost reaching the nest, then used her bill to ‘scrape’ the water from the feathers on her breast before moving onto the nest and settling down to incubate the eggs. When she left the nest she would walk off the nest onto the branch, drop off the branch into the water, land on her belly and then immediately swim quietly away. She did this at the slightest hint of danger, such as people approaching along the bank or even cattle grazing along the river bank towards the nest. Although the male swam past below the nest, at no time did he attempt to leave the water and approach the nest.</p>",

The qualifier ‘African’ is a poor compromise in a genus which currently includes 10 exclusively African species; ‘Blue-billed’ was at least descriptive, if not a unique characteristic. Often found in thick cover, this firefinch is best located by its high-pitched trilling call – although older birders note regretfully that their inability to hear African Firefinches is often the first warning of hearing loss in the high-frequency range. When it does emerge into the open, it is a beautiful little bird. The male has deep red underparts and the fine white spots on the flanks, whereas the female has paler underparts. Pairs or small groups (which may be family parties) forage mainly on the ground, seldom in association with other species. It is a regular visitor to bird feeders in some gardens. Ringed birds have survived up to five years, and the only individual recaptured away from the ringing site had moved &lt;20 km.</p><p>Courtship has been closely observed in captive birds. Both sexes frequently twist their tails, displaying the black undertail coverts. Initially, the male sidles up to the female on her perch with a small piece of nesting material in his bill, which is then dropped. As the display intensifies, the male adopts a stretched posture with some head and breast feathers ruffled, singing while holding nesting material, and finally bounces up and down on the perch. As in many other birds, the female may solicit copulation by quivering her tail.</p><p>Courtship has been closely observed in captive birds.

The male builds the main structure: a ball of dry grass blades with a side entrance, surrounding an inner lining of fine grass seedheads. The nest can be up to two metres above the ground, generally well concealed in dense undergrowth. Feathers may be added to the lining, with both sexes often bringing additional lining material throughout the incubation and nestling period. The male shares in incubation, although it appears that only females incubate at night. Both sexes feed the young in the nest, and for some days after they fledge. In our region, this species is parasitised regularly by the Dusky Indigobird, males of which reproduce perfectly the typical African Firefinch song and high tinkling calls in their own displays. In West Africa, based on the evidence of song mimicry, the parasite is a different species, the Cameroon Indigobird. We have no information on the impact of parasitism on populations of this firefinch, but it is surely less important than illegal captures for the cage-bird trade.</p>",

Best known globally is North America’s Bald Eagle, the symbolic bird of the United States and known to everyone in the nation, while right across sub-Saharan Africa our African Fish Eagle is probably the best-known bird of prey on the continent. That it is not an eagle in the true sense of the word (being related most closely to kites), and that it is given to piracy and scavenging carcasses, has not tarnished its image as a colourful and vocal icon of the wetlands of the continent.</p><p>African Fish Eagles are found widely in southern Africa, everywhere closely tied to wetlands. They are present in abundance in the Okavango delta and along the large tropical rivers that transect the Zambezi Region, but also occur along virtually all the larger rivers, and on the larger lakes, dams, lagoons and coastal estuaries in the region. There are areas where they have declined in recent decades, but others where they’ve increased, but overall these large birds of prey have been less impacted than most by burgeoning human populations in southern Africa and by the immense transformation of natural habitat that has occurred.</p><p>African Fish Eagles are found widely in southern Africa, everywhere closely tied to wetlands.

Established pairs call a great deal, especially at dawn and dusk and at the onset of the breeding cycle. The call is a ringing, far-carrying ‘weeeah, kyow, kyo kyo kyo’, the male’s higher-pitched than the female’s. Pairs often call in tandem, either sex initiating the duet. They call both from perches and while in flight and, whether perched or flying, they exuberantly throw back their head as they do so.</p><p>Once adult, African Fish Eagles are mostly found in pairs which occupy permanent territories that vary in size according to the nature of the wetland: along the Zambezi River, for example, pairs are spaced three kilometres apart, whereas along rivers in the Kruger National Park they average eight kilometres apart, this being a consequence of river size and quality. Fish are caught by scanning the water from a waterside perch and, when prey is sighted, the bird swoops gracefully down, talons extended, snatching the fish up on contact. Fish up to a kilogram in size are handled with ease and these are carried away to a perch to eat. In food-rich environments the birds may only spend 5-10% of their day actively fishing, and a study done on Lake Naivasha in Kenya in the 1960s showed that they spent, on average, only eight minutes a day fishing.</p><p>While fish are the main source of food for these eagles, a percentage of their diet consists of any aquatic bird they can catch, from ducklings to moorhens and crakes, to grebes and jacanas. They also eat frogs and toads, especially when these amphibians are mating in shallow water in a pan or along a river. Breeding colonies of herons and egrets are often raided for nestlings, and carrion, mostly in the form of washed-up fish carcasses, is eaten at times. Lastly, to complete the picture of ‘a bird of low moral character’ they rob pelicans, ospreys, storks, herons and others of fish they have caught when and if they can.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Golden Oriole is a partial intra-African migrant which arrives in southern Africa in  mid-September. Some birds are resi&#173;dent, but the numbers of resident birds are small compared with the numbers which arrive in September in the brachystegia woodlands of the Zimbabwean plateau. On arrival the male immediately takes up territory and starts calling loudly. He flies from point to point within his territory and calls with a liquid ‘weer-er-er-wul’; the Afrikaans name of wielewaal is derived from this call.</p><p>The male is a very handsome bright yellow bird with a red bill and eye, and a black stripe extending from the bill, round the eye towards the back of the head. The wings have yellow coverts which immediately distinguishes this species from the Eurasian Golden Oriole. The female is more greenish-yellow and not nearly as striking as the male. Younger birds are even duller than the female, and it is these birds which are usually helpers at nests with chicks.</p><p>The male is a very handsome bright yellow bird with a red bill and eye, and a black stripe extending from the bill, round the eye towards the back of the head.

Younger birds are even duller than the female, and it is these birds which are usually helpers at nests with chicks.</p><p>They are found as a summer visitor to northern Namibia and Botswana and throughout Zimbabwe, south into Limpopo and into Mozambique. They occur in the broad-leaved woodlands and are often very common in the well-developed brachystegia woodlands of the Zimbabwean plateau. Like the Black-headed Oriole, they are very tolerant of man and are common birds in farm homestead gardens in Zimbabwe.</p><p>This species is a canopy forager feeding on insects, especially caterpillars. One pair I photographed brought large caterpillars at least 75 mm long to feed to the chicks. These caterpillars were bashed against a branch to pulp it before offering it to a chick. The chick could not swallow the whole caterpillar at one gulp so it lay with most of the caterpillar hanging out of its beak. After about five minutes it gulped another section down and digested that portion before gulping the next portion. In this way the whole caterpillar disappeared into the chick within four or five gulps!</p><p>Being migrants, African Golden Orioles arrive and start breeding somewhat later than the Black-headed Orioles. The first nests are usually started towards the end of September or in early October. These nests consist of a hammock of strands of Usnea (Old Man’s Beardlichen)slung between two horizontal branches of a fork,but the main construction of the nest is done with fine grass and similar material. Unlike Usnea, the grass does not absorb large quantities of water when it rains. This  obviates the nest getting saturated with water and becoming so heavy that it collapses. This is a very important factor because the birds often have chicks in the nest when the first heavy rains of the season start in late October and early November.</p><p>The birds lay a clutch of two beautiful pink eggs speckled with red and brown at the thicker end. When a female sometimes lays three eggs, the weakest chick is almost invariably ejected from the nest long before it can fly. The remaining two chicks manage to stay in the nest as they get bigger. At one nest where we watched the nest from start of construction, it was the female that did the building while the male patrolled his territory. It was also noted that the female appeared to do all the incubation but once the chicks had hatched the male fed them as often as the female. We also noticed that most of the Golden Oriole nests which we found had at least one, and sometimes two, subadult helpers feeding the chicks. These birds are much paler and duller than the female. However, they would feed the chicks as often as the adults did.</p>",

It is also one of the few African bird species which has been seen ‘anting’ in the wild, picking up ants which produce formic acid, and passing them through its feathers. This behaviour might reduce the numbers of external parasites, like bird lice, but it is so rarely recorded that none of the proposed explanations is entirely convincing. Golden Weavers often feed in bushes or even in the tree canopy, collecting insects, fruit and nectar, especially at flowering Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala. They are likely to be quite sedentary, and the few ringed birds recaptured have remained within 10 km of their original ringing site.</p><p>Although Golden Weavers are mainly monogamous, they may form loose colonies of two to three birds, and each male constructs several nests on his territory. Often only one will be occupied, but occasionally polygynous breeding is recorded. Males strip the leaves from vegetation surrounding the nest, which is often suspended from the end of a branch, up to three metres above the ground, sometimes supported at the sides by vertical reed or grass stems. In gardens, a tree overhanging a pond is a favourite site, and nests elsewhere are often suspended over water. The nest is a very bulky and untidy structure by weaver standards, tightly woven of grass strips and lacking a tunnel, with the entrance on the underside.  The female contributes to the outer structure as well as adding the lining, although she visits less often than the male. Inside there is generally a pad of plant down, and some feathers may be added. Grass seed heads may protrude from the entrance once the nest has been lined.</p><p>Although Golden Weavers are mainly monogamous, they may form loose colonies of two to three birds, and each male constructs several nests on his territory.

This courtship display may be performed near the nest, or elsewhere when a breeding pair meets up after a separation. The Golden Weaver is an occasional host of the Dideric Cuckoo, and its old nests have been used for breeding by Brown Firefinches and Orange-breasted Waxbills. A female may lay two clutches in a season, but we have no information on breeding success. Both sexes feed the nestlings, although the female contributes more food, and she is solely responsible for incubation. The chicks are fed largely insects; at two nests grasshoppers with their hind legs pulled off were the major food item.</p>",

Its range extends from Cape Town to Sierra Leone, with a turnover of races found across this large range, and everywhere it is a familiar bird in forested environments. The limited occurrence of forest in southern Africa means that it is restricted to the eastern side of the subcontinent; nonetheless, it is a common resident here in the montane forests, in the lowland, coastal and sand forests, and in the many ribbons of riparian forest that thread their way westwards into the arid savanna.</p><p>African Goshawks make their presence known to all and sundry who share their environment by making daily flights, calling as they circle and glide high above the forest canopy. Such flights are pretty much a daily occurrence and are performed by both sexes, the aerial ‘song’ typically being performed around sunrise each day and lasting from several minutes to a half-hour or more. Its intensity varies seasonally, peaking at the onset of the breeding season, and at such times several birds may be heard calling simultaneously from above different parts of an extensive forest. The note uttered is a sharp ‘kvit’ repeated at intervals of a few seconds, and it is a sound that is often incorporated by robin-chats into their repertoire and used by Square-tailed Drongos within the forest as a predator warning.</p><p>African Goshawks make their presence known to all and sundry who share their environment by making daily flights, calling as they circle and glide high above the forest canopy.

The note uttered is a sharp ‘kvit’ repeated at intervals of a few seconds, and it is a sound that is often incorporated by robin-chats into their repertoire and used by Square-tailed Drongos within the forest as a predator warning.</p><p>One of my abiding memories is of a clash between two top aerial predators that I once witnessed from a high krans overlooking a forest in Mpumalanga. An early morning African Goshawk was circling above the forest far below me, calling as it does, when a Peregrine Falcon launched off from the top of the cliff and plunged out of view in a stoop towards the direction of the calling. Both birds were lost to view and I saw neither again, but the calling stopped abruptly, and a few minutes later, soft body feathers of the goshawk came wafting up past where I was sitting. Predators can fall prey to more powerful predators, and the African Goshawk is no exception.</p><p>All birds in the size range between a pigeon and a sunbird are potential prey for African Goshawks, and forest birds everywhere are very aware of their presence, falling silent and remaining still whenever the Square-tailed Drongo sounds the alarm that the hawk is in the vicinity. Birds are the goshawk’s staple diet and they are caught by stealth, ambush and hot pursuit, the hawk’s short, rounded wings and long tail giving it great manoeuvrability when pursuing prey through branches and vines. Places where birds return for food such as seeding grasses or fruiting trees, or places where birds bathe, are repeatedly visited by the hawk, and any free-range poultry living in a goshawk area will seldom manage to raise any offspring. Other prey taken by these goshawks includes squirrels, bats, agama lizards, frogs, termite alates and more.</p><p>Despite its commonness, African Goshawks aren’t easily seen at close quarters as they usually retreat from view if approached, and their life history is not that well studied. Males and females differ not only in size – the female being a third to a half larger than the male – but also in plumage, and one could be forgiven for thinking the male and female are two different species. He has a grey head and upperparts, she is darkish brown above; his underparts are finely barred with chestnut, and the flanks are washed with rufous; her underparts have broader, cold brown barring, and there is no rufous wash on the flanks. It is probable that, because of their size difference, males and females specialise in hunting different-sized prey but there is no proof of this.</p>",

Most of the species’ range falls in areas with an average annual rainfall of 700-800 mm. It occurs from western and central Africa south to southern Africa, but the species’ distribution is patchy almost throughout its geographical range. In southern Africa, it can be found in two main areas. One area encompasses the central Zimbabwean Plateau and east to western Mozambique. Here the birds are found in grassy dambos, and particularly small springs on valley sides which create sponges where grass thickets occur. The other population concentration is in the South African grasslands. In addition, there are scattered popu&#173;lations in the coastal grasslands from East London as far west as De Hoop Nature Reserve and Napier in the Western Cape.</p><p>In appearance, the African Grass Owl is superficially similar to the Western Barn Owl. Both species have a whitish facial disc, but the grass owl is larger and much darker brown on the back. Confusion is also possible with the dark-backed Marsh Owl, with which it sometimes shares habitats, but the African Grass Owl is paler below, with whiter underwings.</p><p>In appearance, the African Grass Owl is superficially similar to the Western Barn Owl.

Confusion is also possible with the dark-backed Marsh Owl, with which it sometimes shares habitats, but the African Grass Owl is paler below, with whiter underwings.</p><p>The birds are mainly nocturnal, flying out to hunt after dark and returning to their roost just before dawn, but on overcast days they sometimes hunt at dusk and in the early part of the day. The birds hunt by flying slowly, twisting their heads to locate prey. Prey includes large vlei rats (Otomys species), Multimammate Mice (Mastomys species), Cape Mole-rats Georychus capensis, Water Rat Dasymus incomtus, Duthie’s Golden Mole Chlorotalpa duthiae, and less often African Hedgehog Atelerix frontalis, elephant shrews, hares, bats, frogs, large beetles and termite alates. A pair that was studied in KwaZulu-Natal preyed on Hottentot Golden Moles Amblysomus hottentota. These are generally uncommon as a prey item, suggesting some expertise by this particular pair at finding these largely burrow-dwelling mammals. The male and female of a pair use different roost sites – the individual roost sites may develop into caves in the grass where pellets, the keys to their diet, can be found. The roost sites themselves can develop into nest sites.</p><p>African Grass Owls mostly nest in rank grass, making an unlined hollow, often at the end of a tunnel. One nest at Ruigtevlei, near Sedgefield in the Western Cape, was in fairly dense fynbos on the side of a small hill, at least 400 metres from reed beds along the Karatara River. Two to six eggs are laid at two-day intervals, and incubation may begin with either the first-laid or last-laid egg. For the first week or so after hatching the chicks are brooded by the female, the male bringing food for both female and brood. At about a month old, the chicks begin to wander into the tunnels in the grass surrounding the nest site. Young fledge at about two months old, and remain with the adults for about another month after fledging.</p><p>Despite being locally common in some areas, the African Grass Owl is of serious conservation concern, being uncommon to rare over much of its range. Its southern African range has contracted and it has become locally extinct in some areas. It is impacted by draining of wetlands, ploughing, grazing and frequent fires.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Green Pigeon’s range extends from Senegambia in the west, east to East Africa and south to South Africa, mainly to the higher rainfall areas in the east. Historically, its range in South Africa extended south to about Humansdorp, but has been reduced, probably through land-use changes, with the Grahamstown-East London district now being the southern limit to the species’ occurrence. These birds favour closed woodlands with evergreen trees (especially wild figs), climax miombo woodlands, mixed-species woodlands, coastal forest, gallery forests along rivers in open savanna woodlands, and parks and gardens.</p><p>African Green Pigeons are almost entirely frugivorous, eating a wide range of sizes and shapes of juicy fruits from many species of wild and cultivated trees. Wild figs are important, especially the large fruits of the Sycamore Fig (Ficus sycamorus), Red-leaved Fig F. ingens, Common Wild Fig F. burkei and possibly the small fruits of the Natal Fig F. natalensis, and the birds will fly over extensive areas of unsuitable foraging habitat to reach a wild fig tree in fruit. The birds are particularly common in parks and rest camps in game reserves where there are large Sycamore Figs, often sharing this resource in Kruger National Park with Brown-headed Parrots.</p><p>African Green Pigeons are almost entirely frugivorous, eating a wide range of sizes and shapes of juicy fruits from many species of wild and cultivated trees.

The birds are particularly common in parks and rest camps in game reserves where there are large Sycamore Figs, often sharing this resource in Kruger National Park with Brown-headed Parrots.</p><p>African Green Pigeons are efficient dispersers of plants. The seeds that are in the fruits they eat are not digested – African Green Pigeons lack the muscular gizzard and seed-crushing ability of seed-eating pigeons – and seeds pass through their digestive systems more or less intact. This characteristic of the African Green Pigeon provided an unexpected service for the reserve management at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, Limpopo Province. Seedlings that germinated in African Green Pigeon droppings below roosts were collected, as were seedlings that grew below nest sites from seeds voided or regurgitated by nestlings. These were planted in nursery bags and eventually planted out around the houses and other buildings at the reserve.</p><p>Nests of this species are usually solitary, but Green Pigeons sometimes breed in loose colonies with nests about 20 metres apart. Nest material is collected by the male, who breaks twigs from trees and brings them to the female at the nest site. The male settles with the material a short distance away from the nest, and then slowly approaches the nest, passing material to the female, who builds by tucking twigs under her body onto the nest, infrequently helped by the male. Nest-building is not very competently done – at one nest it was estimated that only 25% of the nest material brought by the male was successfully built into the nest. The nest itself is a frail platform of twigs and leaf petioles, placed on a horizontal branch or fork on a sloping branch, usually about 5 metres above ground. The birds frequently nest in gardens, and at Nylsvley Nature Reserve the only nests that were found were in trees around the houses and offices, and 9 out of 10 nests were in alien trees, including beef-woods (Casuarina species), silky oaks (Greyvilia species), gum trees (Eucalyptus species) and jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia).</p><p>African Green Pigeons have rather low breeding success in gardens because the incubating bird sometimes knocks the egg or eggs from the nest when disturbed. Nest losses due to strong winds in the wild, and in gardens, have also been recorded. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This species is found right across the northern half of southern Africa in a wide range of different open woodland types but is usually absent from areas of dense woodland.&#160; In my experience in the miombo woodland of the Zimbabwean plateau, its local distribution is linked to the presence of suitable nest holes.&#160;Brachystegia trees, unlike Mopane trees, do not have lots of hollow trunks. Holes are created where branches break off and the stump has rotted down into the tree trunk. These holes need to be fairly large, at least 200&#160;mm in diameter and some 300 to 500&#160;mm deep.&#160; It is interesting that several of the nests I found had the entrance hole about a third from the top of the hole so that the female had somewhere she could scramble up into if the hole was opened by a predator.</p><p>The African Grey Hornbill has a well-known high-pitched call in which the male starts with a series of single discreet notes which gradually change into much longer piping notes. This call is accompanied by wing flicking as part of the display to the female.</p><p>The African Grey Hornbill has a well-known high-pitched call in which the male starts with a series of single discreet notes which gradually change into much longer piping notes. This call is accompanied by wing flicking as part of the display to the female.</p><p>In much of its range the birds live in pairs or in small family groups. However, in Botswana in August one may encounter this species in quite large groups of 20-40 birds all moving in the same general direction as they forage through the open woodlands.&#160; The birds have a light, buoyant flight, often gliding on open wings from one bush to the next. They forage both in trees and on the ground, with the latter being more important in the dry months.&#160; They are omnivorous, eating insects, small mammals and reptiles, and fruit, especially wild figs like Red-leaved Fig Ficus ingens. At Red-billed Quelea colonies, I have observed them feeding extensively on the chicks.</p><p>The Grey Hornbill is typical of the hornbill family in its nesting habits. In spring each pair searches for a suitable hole in a tree. The entrance may be quite large but it is important that the nest hole itself is over 150&#160;mm in diameter. In miombo woodland where these holes are in short supply Meyer’s Parrots often use a hole in winter followed by Grey Hornbills in spring and then Lilac-breasted or Broad-billed Rollers in summer.</p><p>After the birds mate, the female retreats into the nest where she reduces the entrance to a slit which is usually about 15&#160;mm&#160;wide and 50&#160;mm deep.&#160; She uses pieces of insects, millipedes and bark which are cemented together with her faeces to create the material for the entrance plug.&#160;In the nest where we were able to monitor laying, she laid her first egg ten days after sealing the entrance and then laid two more at three-day intervals. With the female nest-bound, incubation starts when the first egg is laid, so the development of the chicks is staggered, and they leave the nest over a protracted period.</p><p>The male provisions the female and young chicks. The female leaves the nest when the chicks are half-grown and helps the male feed the chicks thereafter. The chicks reseal the entrance.</p><p>The chicks break the seal when the largest one is fully feathered and the first chick emerges. In one nest we observed, the remaining chicks resealed the entrance then broke it again for the second chick to come out. The third chick did not reseal the entrance and in fact joined the other two a day after the second chick had emerged, and they then accompanied the adults around the nest area for some weeks after leaving the nest. At this stage they all looked like females.&#9;</p>",

The feature that it shares with no other raptor is its unfeathered face (or literally ‘bare cheeks’), and furthermore that this bare skin area around the eye changes from yellow to red depending on the state of excitement of the bird. Watching an African Harrier-Hawk pair interacting, especially at the nest, is where this colour-changing behaviour is most apparent, though it can be witnessed in other contexts such as when, for example, a foraging bird is startled when the perch it is on snaps, or when a raptor of another species unexpectedly appears overhead.</p><p>African Harrier-Hawks occur widely across southern Africa, being commonest in the mesic east, but they also range into the semi-arid west, especially in rocky, mountainous country. They occur, too, in many well-wooded towns and villages. From the southern Cape their range extends northwards across sub-Saharan Africa with a second closely related bird, the Madagascar Harrier-Hawk, being restricted to that island. The name harrier-hawk is no indication of the true affinities of these two taxa which have been aligned at times with snake eagles, at times with various South American hawks, including the caracara, and at times with chanting goshawks. Where they actually fit in phylogenically with the Accipitridae is still obscure.</p><p>African Harrier-Hawks occur widely across southern Africa, being commonest in the mesic east, but they also range into the semi-arid west, especially in rocky, mountainous country.

Where they actually fit in phylogenically with the Accipitridae is still obscure.</p><p>Harrier-Hawks have long, broad wings, a long tail and slim bodies. Their flight is languid, whether they are soaring or flapping to gain momentum. Their hunting techniques are varied and range from cruising slowly past rock faces in search of prey, to flying from tree to tree, inspecting trunks and branches for prey before moving on, to walking about on the ground in search of a bird’s nest or insects. The bird’s legs have a double-jointed inter-tarsal joint which allows the tarsus to swivel backwards or forwards, and this enables the bird to insert its foot into crevices and holes to extract prey. They rob woodpecker nests of their contents in this way, and they can extract bats, squirrels, lizards and other items from tree or rock crevices where these have taken cover. Weaver nests are a common target, the bird hanging suspended below these while inserting its foot into the nest. Nestling birds, although mostly only seasonally available, are very common prey items, from weavers, swifts and swallows to the nestlings of water birds such as herons and darters. It has also been observed that they use the mobbing behaviour of small birds to pinpoint the position of nests. They have been observed, for example, locating and robbing a Fork-tailed Drongo nest when the drongo rose up from its nest to intercept the hawk cruising overhead.</p><p>Pairs begin the nesting cycle in early spring, and they often return to a previous year’s nest for this purpose. The classic nest site is at the head of a ravine in a tree overhanging a pool or waterfall but, of course, such sites are not available everywhere and they may breed on open cliff faces, in tall riverine trees, in eucalypt plantations and elsewhere, and some are known to have taken over nests of other birds of prey. A new nest takes about a month to complete, and it is thickly lined with green foliage before the clutch of two eggs is laid. The eggs are unusual in being a rich red-brown, colouring typically associated with the eggs of falcons, but this also matches the egg colour in the caracara, one of the harrier-hawk’s suggested kin.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Hawk-Eagle is another member of the savanna eagle group with a range that extends from Zululand to the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. In southern Africa it occurs widely, from the arid west to the mesic east, and it is likely to be resident wherever it is undisturbed, where there is prey, and where there are sufficiently large tall trees to support a nest. It lives in both relief-free country - where it occurs at greatest densities - and in hilly to mountainous terrain. In the undulating, knobthorn-dominated plains of the Kruger National Park, for example, the territories of nesting pairs are about 50-60 square kilometres in extent compared with that, say, in the mountainous Waterberg region of Limpopo where the average territory size is double, about 110 square kilometres. Such differences in eagle densities probably reflect the respective carrying capacities for the eagles, based on respective prey densities.</p><p>Favoured prey varies regionally, with African Hawk-Eagles taking a higher proportion of reptiles in the more arid areas, while gamebirds dominate the prey mix in the east, and hyrax dominate in Zimbabwe’s Matobos region. I have always considered it to be a specialist gamebird predator in the Nylsvley area where several pairs breed, and I have twice watched a pair, hunting as a team, successfully catch guineafowl and Swainson’s Francolin. In both cases one of the pair distracted the birds being targeted in a high fly-past while the other skimmed in low behind cover and snatched up the victim in its talons. Following a scuffle to subdue the catch, the successful bird was joined by its mate, which circled back, and both eagles then fed on the carcass. If an intended victim escapes into the cover of a thicket it’s not unknown for an African Hawk-Eagle to head in after it on foot.</p><p>Favoured prey varies regionally, with African Hawk-Eagles taking a higher proportion of reptiles in the more arid areas, while gamebirds dominate the prey mix in the east, and hyrax dominate in Zimbabwe’s Matobos region.

If an intended victim escapes into the cover of a thicket it’s not unknown for an African Hawk-Eagle to head in after it on foot.</p><p>One often sees African Hawk-Eagles together in pairs, either soaring or perched alongside each other in a tall tree, and from studies it seems that they pair for life and maintain a strong pair bond year-round. When seen together, the difference in spotting on their chests is striking, with the female having more heavily marked underparts than the male. Unless one is close enough to see the chest markings, the birds appear to be simply black and white (black above and white below), and this pattern persists when they are seen in flight, the white underparts broken by a broad black terminal tail-band, black underwing coverts, and black trailing edges on the wings. When a flying bird banks and shows its mainly black upper-parts there is a distinctive white panel visible in the outer wing which is always a good identification feature, even when the bird is barely visible in the distance.</p><p>Like many other eagles, winter is when these eagles breed, but they usually lay a little later than, say, Martial or Tawny Eagles, often only producing their clutch in June or July. Before this they spend weeks or even months repairing the nest or building a new one, and it is an impressive structure, sometimes exceeding in size that of the much larger Martial Eagle. The nest is almost invariably built in a tree, with just a few cliff-nesting records known, and there’s one record of an electricity pylon-nesting pair. Some pairs return year after year to the same nest to breed, others alternate every few years between a few nests. In knobthorn country this tree is the most frequently used whereas, if baobabs are present, they are often preferred. It is always placed in a forked branch well below the tree canopy. The nesting cycle is unusually short for the size of the eagle, the incubation lasting about 44 days and the nestling period 60-70 days, but in other respects nesting behaviour is similar to that of other savanna eagles.</p>",

Hence, it is essentially a vagrant to southern Africa, although sightings here are generally restricted to the warmer, wetter summer months, suggesting an element of seasonal migration.</p><p>Like most falcons, it is a fast flyer and is often active early in the morning or late in the evening, when viewing conditions are poor.

However, the hobby is much more slender, with longer wings and tail, and more buoyant flight, and lacks the pale rump, full head cap and large, rufous nape patches diagnostic of the stocky, very short-tailed Taita Falcon.  Also, the latter is rarely seen away from its favoured cliff habitat, while the African Hobby is more likely to been seen in well-wooded plains areas. The Eurasian Hobby might be seen in the same habitats as its African counterpart, and quite strongly resembles African Hobby in its general appearance.

It may also hunt more sedately from a high perch in a prominent or emergent tree. It seems to be mainly insectivorous in our region and is sometimes seen following rain fronts, hawking emerging termite alates with other small raptors. However, it is also a very successful predator of small birds (finches, swallows, up to dove size), and takes mainly birds when breeding. In southern Africa it is most often seen in the palm savannas of Ovamboland, but is reputed to frequent and even to breed in urban centres in other parts of Africa. It nests in stick structures built by other species (e.g. other raptors, corvids), and may achieve relatively high breeding densities in core areas of West Africa. It lays up to four eggs in late winter or spring.</p>",

They battle to fly into strong winds, typically opting to fly very close to the ground where wind speeds are lower.

Its natural habitat is probably savanna and savanna woodland, but it has adapted well to other open areas, as long as there are a few scattered trees. It is even found in Kalahari thornveld and, in drier areas, occurs in the riverine woodlands that criss-cross the Karoo and parts of Namibia. Although not usually considered to be a migrant, African Hoopoes disappear from the southern Cape for several months in winter. Upon arriving back in late July or August, they immediately make their presence known by their loud calls. In the Great and Little Karoo they appear to move away during very dry periods.</p><p>African Hoopoes feed on the ground, walking around with a rather jerky action, probing in the ground for invertebrates. They extract white grubs and a variety of other soft, worm-like invertebrates from garden lawns. It is interesting to watch them extract an earthworm – the worm is stretched until it eventually slides out of the ground!</p><p>African Hoopoes cannot excavate their own nest holes. Nonetheless, they are able to nest in a variety of different sites which is probably one of the reasons why they are so successful. In the southern Cape they make use of natural holes in stumps and trees. In Zimbabwe, they make extensive use of the open chimneys of termite nests – the birds disappear down the chimney as they land! In one nest we could see the eggs on the top of the termites’ nest, which looked rather like paper, directly below the chimney. The termites seem to take no notice of the hoopoes or their chicks.</p><p>The hoopoes also make extensive use of both natural objects and man-made holes in buildings, and they will readily accept nest boxes, provided the entrance is constructed so that the birds can land and walk into the nest. The faeces are not removed and the nest becomes foul-smelling towards the end of the nestling period. When threatened, the chicks squirt foul-smelling liquid faeces at the intruder; this is usually followed by secretion of an equally foul-smelling brown liquid from the preen gland. In Zimbabwe, they were one of the first species to start nesting and regularly reared a second brood in the nest in our garden, provided it did not rain very heavily during the second nestling period.&#9;</p>",

It is also a quite unmistakable bird, having a rich chestnut plumage, a black-and-white neck and head, and an azure blue bill and frontal shield. The exceptionally long toes and toenails that characterise the jacana family and enable these birds to forage nonchalantly on often precarious floating vegetation complete the profile. In the African Jacana the foot span is about two thirds of its body length, giving it unrivalled access to areas on wetlands that are unreachable by other Charadriiformes, and floating rafts of plant stems and leaves, especially those of the various species of Nymphaea lilies, are where African Jacanas forage, loaf, mate, nest and roost.</p><p>On the other hand, when African Jacanas venture onto land, or when they settle on a nest to incubate, their long toes are a decided handicap, as they probably also are when the birds undertake long flights between wetlands. The African Jacana’s lifestyle is thus one of compromises because many of the wetlands that support them change over time, flooding and drying in response to wet and dry years, and in so doing affect the bird’s habitat positively or negatively. In ‘good’ years wetlands can support high densities of these birds but as these dry out, so these birds increasingly compete for the diminishing space available, some leaving to seek out better areas, others surviving by foraging along marginal shorelines until they too are also forced to move elsewhere.</p><p>On the other hand, when African Jacanas venture onto land, or when they settle on a nest to incubate, their long toes are a decided handicap, as they probably also are when the birds undertake long flights between wetlands.

There are occasional records of single birds, usually immatures, arriving at water holes in the arid west (in the Kgalagadi Park and in the Namib, for example), these obviously being lone wanderers that took a wrong direction. Much of the commuting happens unseen at night, and even in stable habitats there is a steady turnover of individuals, arrivals and departures usually taking place after dark.</p><p>All but one of the World’s eight jacana species is polyandrous. This is a rare breeding system in the bird world whereby females have multiple breeding partners, and the African Jacana exhibits one of the most extreme forms of the behaviour yet recorded. Much is dependent on environmental conditions, however, and in my own studies of this bird I found situations where a breeding pair was monogamous, others where females were sequentially or simultaneously polyandrous, laying eggs for as many as seven males in a season, and even one instance where there was a polygynous association of a male mating successively with two different females! African Jacanas lay their clutches of eggs on very skimpy nests placed out on floating vegetation, and the instability of the site is one of several factors that contribute to their having an unusually high nest failure rate.</p><p>Parental care, from incubation to chick rearing, is done by the male without female assistance, and once a female has laid a clutch for a male, she is free to consort with other males, and to lay eggs for them too. Some marked females I watched laid as many as 10 clutches in a five-month breeding season. In some cases where her first male lost his clutch before she was ready to re-lay, he’d woo her back to a new nest and receive her second clutch, and sometimes even her third, fourth and fifth – if his clutches disappeared before she had started laying for another male. Polyandry kicked in when clutch survival improved, allowing her to lay, after her initial clutch for the alpha male, for other lower-ranked males in the pool.</p><p>This breeding system is intimately linked with a territorial arrangement whereby males each establish a breeding territory to which they woo the female and from which they vigorously repel other males. Females behave similarly, initially attempting to exclude other females from just the area encompassing the territory of the alpha male, but enlarging this as their harem expands to encompass the territories of other males with which they mate. Males and females that don’t secure such territories remain on the fringes and don’t get to breed, and males and females that are incapable of keeping competitors at bay soon lose their breeding space and either move on, die from wounds, or live in marginal habitat on the fringes.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Harriers are a specialised group of 16 species of raptor that exhibit a number of adaptations for living in open, treeless country. They are long-winged, long-tailed and slender-bodied hawks that do all their hunting on the wing, they nest on the ground, and they have a unique technique whereby the male transfers food by an aerial transfer to the female during the nesting period. The African Marsh Harrier is the best-known species in the group, and it breeds from the southern Cape northwards into East Africa, its stronghold in the region probably being the Okavango Delta. It is restricted to areas of extensive wetland, especially reed, sedge and papyrus marshes and swamps.</p><p>Because it spends up to half its day in flight, the African Marsh Harrier is a bird that is usually encountered on the wing. It flies low and slow when hunting, moving at about 20-25 km/hour as it quarters the ground, seldom more than two metres up, head facing down and wings angled upward, as it methodically hunts for its staple diet of small rodents. At intervals, the hunting bird may change direction or it may swoop in if prey is detected, snatching up the victim in its claws. About half the strikes made are successful and the catch may be eaten on the spot, taken to a feeding site to process, or carried to the nest if the birds are breeding. It is estimated that a bird flies about 100 kilometres a day outside the breeding period, and this may double when a male is provisioning his mate and chicks.</p><p>Because it spends up to half its day in flight, the African Marsh Harrier is a bird that is usually encountered on the wing.

It is estimated that a bird flies about 100 kilometres a day outside the breeding period, and this may double when a male is provisioning his mate and chicks.</p><p>Harriers have distinctly cowled faces similar to those of owls which, it is thought, act as a sort of parabolic reflector enhancing the bird’s ability to detect the sounds and movements of mice hidden below it. Although rodents, especially the striped mouse and vlei rat, comprise the bulk of the prey it catches, there are reports of African Marsh Harriers catching water birds, including ducks and waders, of taking frogs, and of preying on nestlings of weavers, herons and egrets, and of scavenging fish carcasses.</p><p>Males and females are similar in plumage and they are sedentary, remaining paired year-round, breeding annually in the same general area. The onset of breeding is marked by the male, and sometimes both birds, doing spectacular aerial displays. In one, thought to be primarily a territorial display and referred to as ‘sky dancing’, he climbs a few hundred metres, levels out, then dips and rises in deep undulations, calling with a squealing ‘woeeep’ at the top of each ascent. This is frequently followed by plummeting back towards the ground, feet extended, seemingly out of control, in a courtship flight that is known as ‘sky spiralling’. Just before the ground, he levels out and settles close to the site of the future nest.</p><p>Both sexes build the nest, a saucer-shaped platform of twigs and reed stems, placed in reeds at water level. Laying occurs in early summer in South Africa but the season extends as one moves northwards. The usual clutch is three, less often four eggs, and all incubation is done by the female, and she is fed by the male which brings her food items 3-4 times a day. The transfer of this prey is mostly done on the wing in a well-synchronised movement – as the male approaches, calling, she flies up off the nest and joins him in the air, positioning herself just below and behind him. He does a quick rise before releasing the prey which she then catches as it drops, and then returns to the nest to feed. Long-established pairs have the transfer down to a fine art, seldom losing the prey in the drop, but first-time breeders do less well. Clearly, practise makes perfect.</p>",

It has a high tolerance of transformed habitats, and is common in cultivated areas around villages and in rest camps in game reserves. At Shi&#173;ngwedzi Camp in the Kruger National Park the birds are particularly tame and confiding. In southern Africa, the species occurs in a belt across northern Namibia, the Okavango Delta and Maun area of Botswana, through northern Zimbabwe and along the Zambezi River valley in Mozambique. There is a seemingly separate population in extreme eastern Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, the north-eastern lowveld of South Africa and into adjacent southern Mozambique.</p><p>Although sometimes solitary, African Mourning Doves are usually seen in pairs, and they aggregate in flocks to drink during the morning and evening. Daily movements have been recorded, sometimes in large flocks, with birds moving in groups between roosting, drinking and foraging sites. They usually roost in groups of up to 25 birds, but sometimes roost alone or in pairs.</p><p>Although sometimes solitary, African Mourning Doves are usually seen in pairs, and they aggregate in flocks to drink during the morning and evening. Daily movements have been recorded, sometimes in large flocks, with birds moving in groups between roosting, drinking and foraging sites. They usually roost in groups of up to 25 birds, but sometimes roost alone or in pairs.</p><p>Their daily activity begins at dawn, first with calling from the roost site and then foraging until later in the morning. The birds forage on open sandy areas or fallow fields, sometimes in groups and sometimes in association with other dove species, such as Laughing Doves. Their food includes grass seeds (Panicum species), seeds of forbs such as Devil Thorn Tribulus terrestris and Volstruisdruiwe Giseckia pharnacioides and tree seeds such as silky barks (Maytenus species), shepherd’s trees (Boscia species), and alien Castor Oil Bush Ricinus communis. The very large seeds of Fever Berry Croton megalobotrys are also eaten and have been recorded as food for nestlings. The diet further includes seeds of cultivated plants such as sorghum and sunflower, and seeds and fruits of Mustard Tree Salvadora persica. Very few invertebrate food items have been recorded, but the birds do feed on termite alates during emergences.</p><p>The courtship display of the African Mourning Dove has been well documented and follows the same pattern as the territorial advertisement and courtship displays of most doves and pigeons. In the most frequently performed ‘towering’ display, the male flies up from a perch to about 15 metres above the canopy before gliding down in a shallow arcing dive, landing in the same tree or one close to the take-off point. The main function of this display appears to be to advertise that a territory is occupied. The towering display is followed by ‘bowing’ displays and mating between the territory-holding pair.</p><p>The nest is built by the female, using material brought by the male, usually collected on the ground. The female remains on the nest site, receiving material and building it into the nest. The nest itself is a fairly frail platform of twigs, leaf petioles and leaves, with a shallow depression in the centre lined with rootlets. It is placed up to 15 metres above the ground on a horizontal branch – one in a large tree next to the Botletle River at Maun was even higher than this, being about 18 metres above ground and well concealed at the end of a branch. In the Zambezi River valley nests in Ana-trees are sited above 10.5 metres so that they clear the African Elephant Loxodonta africana browse line.&#9;</p>",

The face has conspicuous and distinctive chrome yellow patches around the eyes, and the bill and feet are bright yellow.</p><p>The species has a patchy distribution through eastern Africa from Ethiopia south to the Western Cape, with isolated populations in the forests of western Angola. This patchy distribution is linked to the natural fragmentation of their primary habitat of evergreen forests – especially Afromontane forests. Although native forests are the bird’s natural habitat, in recent years there has been a noticeable increase in their use of plantations of alien trees, such as pines, eucalypts and Black Wattle Acacia mearnsii and, in the Eastern and Western Cape, thickets of alien Port Jackson Willow Acacia saligna and Rooikrans A. cyclops. Patches of alien invasive, juicy-fruited plants such as Bugweed Solanum mauritianum, Black Tick-berry Osteospermum moniliferum (Chrysanthemoides monolifera) and low-growing inkberries (Phytolacca species) have become favoured foraging places. At Harkerville in the Western Cape, we frequently watched African Olive Pigeons perch on stacks of dry branches and then reach down to pluck fruits from small inkberry plants growing below and between the branches.</p><p>The species has a patchy distribution through eastern Africa from Ethiopia south to the Western Cape, with isolated populations in the forests of western Angola.

At Harkerville in the Western Cape, we frequently watched African Olive Pigeons perch on stacks of dry branches and then reach down to pluck fruits from small inkberry plants growing below and between the branches.</p><p>An important side effect from this habit of eating the fruits of alien plants is that the birds frequently regurgitated seeds of native forest trees when perched on the branches of alien plants, and these forest tree seeds germinated in this sheltered site, although we do not know how well the seedlings survived. This does indicate the potential for African Olive Pigeons to disperse native vegetation. Unfortunately, it also indicates their ability to disperse alien invasive vegetation. Indeed, there is some concern about the potential for African Olive Pigeons to disperse seeds of Bugweed because this plant is invading disturbed forest areas, and Olive Pigeons may be the prime candidates for its transport.</p><p>Of concern here is the distance that seeds could be transported in short periods of time. The birds fly strongly, and move considerable distances between roosting sites (in forests) and feeding sites (which may be away from forests). By way of example of such distances, in the Ruwenzori Mountains of East Africa, African Olive Pigeons roost in high-altitude forests and, in the early mornings, rapidly descend some 2&#160;800 metres to lowland sites where they spend the day feeding.</p><p>The breeding system of the African Olive Pigeon is poorly known. Nests are usually in trees on the edge of forest or in isolated trees adjacent to forest, or even in large and isolated trees in gardens. Compared with other pigeons and doves, nest-building is unusual in that the male searches trees for suitable twigs that he breaks from branches (most pigeons and doves pick up material from the ground). The female, meanwhile, is at the nest site, to which the male brings the twigs, laying them on the female’s back. When the male leaves to find more material, the female removes the twigs and incorporates them into the nest. A single egg is laid, rarely two. The breeding success is largely unknown.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>African Openbills are prehistoric-looking birds with an extraordinary lifestyle that has served them well into the 21st Century. In gliding flight, they are reminiscent of small, black pterodactyls with a rather sinister silhouette – like a black cross – formed by the dark wings, outstretched head and neck, and long, trailing legs and feet. Close-up, the peculiar, seemingly-deformed bill adds to their antediluvian appearance; although the upper mandible is straight, the lower is bent awkwardly, leaving a gap between the two that makes it appear totally dysfunctional. This is such an obvious, almost unique, feature that it has led to the bird being called an ‘openbill’.</p><p>This strange beak, far from being a primitive encumbrance, is in fact a high-precision tool, and the key to understanding the openbill’s extravagant lifestyle and the exclusive ecological niche it occupies. This species feeds almost entirely on snails and mussels, and uses its customised bill to extract the highly nutritious, fleshy molluscs from their hard protective shells. Contrary to expectations, the beak is not used like a nutcracker to break open the mussel or snail shell, but like a pair of tweezers – the tip of the lower mandible is inserted through the shell-opening and used to deftly snip the connection between the mollusc and its shell, an action that takes mere seconds. Snails of the genera Pila and Lanistes are not only nourishing, but they are also unbelievably productive on the floodplains of the large river systems of central and southern Africa where the openbill abounds. Just how numerous these snails are, can be judged from the fact that openbills find them by feel; they stand in belly-deep water probing repeatedly in one place before wading on to try another spot, until they score a direct hit. The fact that openbills occur in enormous flocks is also testimony to the richness of this food source, which is not exploited to any significant degree by any other birds. The mussels, by contrast, are more important for the species’ survival along the lowveld rivers in the east of Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p><p>This strange beak, far from being a primitive encumbrance, is in fact a high-precision tool, and the key to understanding the openbill’s extravagant lifestyle and the exclusive ecological niche it occupies.

The mussels, by contrast, are more important for the species’ survival along the lowveld rivers in the east of Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p><p>There is yet another interesting dimension to the openbill’s specialisation on molluscs – although the snails are relatively static, their abundance varies both in time and space. In the Okavango Delta, for example, the birds follow the annual flood cycle from north to south and back again, searching for receding floodplains where snail populations have been revitalised and the water is shallow enough for the storks to feed. Large flocks of openbills regularly travel great distances throughout south-central Africa looking for optimal feeding areas. Several thousand openbills thermalling high in the sky before disappearing to faraway floodplains is an inspiring and reassuring sight, confirming that an intact system of naturally-functioning rivers and floodplains still endures.</p><p>A specialised diet and correspondingly narrow ecological niche can lead to a precarious existence. Fortunately this is not the case at present for African Openbills; the latest population estimate is 300 000 to 500 000 birds, making it possibly the most abundant stork in Africa. One colony on the Barotse Floodplain of the upper Zambezi River is so large it is easily visible in satellite images. In recent years, higher than average flood levels in the Zambezi, Kwando and Okavango Rivers has led to wholesale, opportunistic breeding by this species, with large new single-species colonies (&gt; 2 500 birds) being documented in the Zambezi Region and northern Botswana. During the subsequent irruption, African Openbills dispersed widely throughout the region, turning up in the most unlikely places. In 2010, they spread south through KwaZulu-Natal and then westwards through the Western Cape. New subpopulations established themselves wherever they found suitable habitat, bearing testimony to the effectiveness of the openbill’s lifestyle.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Palm Swift is easily recognised by its extremely slender build and long, deeply forked tail, which is usually held closed, appearing pointed. Young birds have shorter tails and could be confused with the localised Scarce Swift, restricted in our area to the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique. The Palm Swift has a close relative in south-east Asia, hence the need to qualify our birds as the African Palm Swift.</p><p>My introduction to the Palm Swift was sitting on a veranda of a farmhouse watching the Palm Swifts fly up into the skirt of a Washington Palm. The palm tree had at least ten active nests, and probably more, as one couldn’t really see all the nests up in the skirt of dead palm leaves. Subsequently we were to trap and ring some of these swifts, and were also able to show that on a cold winter’s night the temperatures dropped low enough to kill some of the birds roosting in the tree. It was clear that in other palm trees in valleys in the Marondera district the birds departed during the midwinter months when the night temperatures could drop to below freezing.</p><p>My introduction to the Palm Swift was sitting on a veranda of a farmhouse watching the Palm Swifts fly up into the skirt of a Washington Palm.

It was clear that in other palm trees in valleys in the Marondera district the birds departed during the midwinter months when the night temperatures could drop to below freezing.</p><p>The Palm Swift is primarily a bird of lower-lying areas where Borassus and Hyphaene Palms occur.&#160; As it dies, the leaf of the Hyphaene Palm closes down to form a gap which is exactly the right width for a swift to fly up into and construct its nest of feathers and bits of grass glued to the leaf with saliva. When the eggs are laid they are also glued into the nest with saliva. The approach of a Palm Swift to its nest requires precision flying; the bird swoops down, and then almost vertically up into the leaf slit. It lands at the bottom of the leaf and scrambles up but its momentum may carry it almost to the nest. Palm Swifts lay two eggs only, as that is all that can fit into the little oval collar of a nest and still be incubated. During incubation the birds come and go very frequently, far more frequently than most incubating birds that I have watched. Subsequently, when the chicks hatch the birds arrive less frequently with their throat pouch full of aerial plankton with which to feed the chicks.</p><p>The Palm Swift has spread across southern African over the last fifty or sixty years because of the planting of a lot of exotic palms such as the Washington and Livingstone Palms, which both form a skirt of dead leaves around the trunk. Their spread has been well documented with the first urban breeding in Durban in 1952 and since then, gradually spreading across Gauteng and through much of the Highveld wherever there are suitable palm trees.</p><p>In Zimbabwe the planting of Washington Palms down some of the major streets created a habitat which has been exploited since the late 1940s. The whole of the Zimbabwe highveld has been colonised wherever there are suitable palm trees. The species has even managed to work its way south from Durban through East London and Port Elizabeth, recently reaching Knysna, George and Oudtshoorn.</p><p>Palm Swifts are usually only seen at their nests during the day when they are breeding. If they do not move away during winter, they return to the nests to roost when it is almost dark, and leave the nest the following morning as soon as there is a glimmer of light in the east. It is probable that there are more Palm Swifts in our urban and farming areas today than there are in the original lowlands where the indigenous palm trees grow.</p>",

Surprisingly, the long tail feathers seem to be no major impediment to flight; males move rapidly with a graceful and undulating flight, or in a more leisurely fashion with their tail streamers seeming to float up and down in their wake. However, there is almost certainly some cost to carrying these ornaments – perhaps elevated predation risk. As soon as breeding is over and the need for sexual advertising has gone, they are moulted out.</p><p>The birds are usually encountered in pairs and are constantly on the move and calling to each other. They forage in a variety of ways, most commonly by flying from a perch to seize non-flying prey, such as caterpillars, from twigs and leaves. They also glean from foliage and hawk flying insects in mid-air. Their diet comprises a wide range of insects, including flies, moths, beetles, wasps, butterflies, termites and ants.</p><p>The birds are usually encountered in pairs and are constantly on the move and calling to each other.

Their diet comprises a wide range of insects, including flies, moths, beetles, wasps, butterflies, termites and ants.</p><p>The males sing a great deal during the early part of the breeding season, from September to November. A territory-owning male also plays an active role in selecting the nesting site by perching on it, flying around it, twittering enticingly to the female and waving his long tail streamers up and down. African Paradise-Flycatchers that frequent wooded suburban areas are not particularly shy, and their confiding nature often extends to choosing a nest site close to the house, as a pair in our garden did. Their nest was characteristically constructed in a forked twig at the outer edge of a Pittosporum tree, and was about three metres above the ground. Fortuitously, it was on a level with our bathroom window and only a few metres away, so it was easy to keep an eye on it. Incubation of the two eggs commenced in the fourth week of October. This task is normally shared in African Paradise-Flycatchers, but initially it seemed that the female was doing most of the incubation. The male could frequently be heard in the neighbouring orchard; perhaps he was indulging in visitations to other paradise-flycatcher females, because polygamy has been suspected for this species.</p><p>He (or perhaps another male) occasionally brought food to the incubating female, but since ‘our’ Paradise-Flycatchers were not individually marked we were unable to determine whether more than one male was involved. Whatever the reason for his seeming dereliction of duty, he redeemed himself after several days and began to undertake regular spells on the nest.</p><p>The eggs hatched during the first week of November. The young were brooded mainly by the female, who sat progressively higher in the nest as the nestlings grew. By 19 November the chicks were ‘branching’ like young raptors, perching on twigs close to the nest, and by later that day they had left the immediate vicinity of the nest. The female was quite vociferous and protective, chasing any other bird that came near, so the fledglings evidently had not moved very far.</p><p>At about 18h00 I walked out from the veranda to see if I could locate them and was immediately set upon and noisily abused by the female, who zipped aggressively around my head and shoulders. Obviously, one of the chicks was very close – in fact, it was perched on a horizontal rose stem just beyond the arched veranda gateway, and I had unseeingly ducked under it when I walked out: small wonder that the parent was so aggressively protective.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The only penguin that breeds in Africa is confined to the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, breeding mainly on islands from central Namibia to Algoa Bay. African Penguins seldom venture more than 50 kilometres offshore, with stragglers wandering north along the continental shelf, exceptionally reaching Gabon and southern Mozambique. They are consummate swimmers and divers. Adults swim at up to 20 km/hour in short bursts when pursuing prey, but they commute at a more energy-efficient 4-6 km/hour. They dive to depths of more than 100 metres and remain underwater for at least three minutes, but most dives are to less than 30 metres and last about one minute. They hunt visually, so almost all dives occur during the day. Their pupils can expand and contract much more than other birds, allowing them to adapt rapidly to the gloomy light levels that prevail under water.</p><p>Adults have boldly striped black-and-white plumage, which helps them scare their favoured prey, Anchovies and Sardines, into dense, defensive schools or ‘baitballs’, which circling groups of penguins attack from below. Juveniles swim too slowly to catch these fast-swimming fish and so have plain, counter-shaded plumage to help avoid predatory seals and sharks. Most moult into the bold adult plumage when they are around a year old, but some juveniles undergo a partial head moult at sea, possibly allowing them entry to adult foraging groups. Adults discriminate against juveniles, and are more tolerant of birds that have the bold adult head pattern.</p><p>Adults have boldly striped black-and-white plumage, which helps them scare their favoured prey, Anchovies and Sardines, into dense, defensive schools or ‘baitballs’, which circling groups of penguins attack from below.

Most moult into the bold adult plumage when they are around a year old, but some juveniles undergo a partial head moult at sea, possibly allowing them entry to adult foraging groups. Adults discriminate against juveniles, and are more tolerant of birds that have the bold adult head pattern.</p><p>Because they commute slowly compared to flying seabirds, breeding penguins are constrained to forage within 20-30 km of their breeding islands while provisioning small chicks. They thus require a reliable source of food within this radius of the colony. It has recently been discovered that African Penguins use their sense of smell to assist in locating fish schools. They are attracted by dimethyl sulphide, a compound released when phytoplankton are grazed by zooplankton or small pelagic fish. The penguin chicks are fed by regurgitation, and adults can slow digestion by reducing stomach acidity and gastric movements to ensure they reach their colonies with a full meal for their chicks.</p><p>Breeding is protracted. Pairs often lay replacement clutches should their initial attempt fail, and some pairs raise two broods in a season. Adults return to the same colony each year to breed, usually retaining the same nest site and mate. However, juveniles sometimes recruit to other colonies, especially if conditions at their natal colony deteriorate. The early 1980s saw three new colonies form in the Western Cape (Robben Island, Boulders and Betty’s Bay) linked to the failure of juveniles to recruit to Dyer Island, which was the world’s largest African Penguin colony in the 1970s.</p><p>There is a long history of human impacts. Disturbance linked to guano collecting and large-scale egg harvesting was followed by oiling, and competition for food with fisheries. Numbers in Namibia collapsed following the demise of Sardine stocks there in the 1970s, and show no sign of recovery. Off South Africa, careful management of the Anchovy fishery allowed fish stocks and penguin numbers to recover somewhat through the 1990s. However, pelagic fish have become scarce off the west coast of South Africa, leaving colonies in this area with little food for their chicks. Adult survival also has decreased, a sure sign that penguins are in trouble. The situation is exacerbated by the increasing frequency of heat waves which cause mass desertion of eggs and chicks. Predation by Cape Fur Seals and stealing of eggs and chicks by Kelp Gulls also become increasingly significant as penguin numbers decrease. The total population halved in the last decade to only 25 000 pairs, and African Penguins are listed as Endangered. Urgent action is needed to conserve this charismatic bird.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>I have two enduring memories of encounters with African Pied Wagtails. One recalls a sunny afternoon on the high bank of the Pongolo River in the Ndumo Game Reserve on the KwaZulu-Natal/Mozambique border. I was watching and recording the snorts and grunts of a hippopotamus herd that occupied that part of the river, which was deep enough for them to submerge entirely. A number of African Pied Wagtails, probably a family group, were using the heads of the hippos as convenient, temporary perches. When one animal submerged, a wagtail would flutter to the head of another. There were no exposed rocks or sandbanks in that part of the river, so the wagtails were opportunistically using the animals’ heads for waterside perches, often snatching at some of the flies that attended the herd and, as I realised when I replayed the tapes, cheerfully calling and singing for much of the time.</p><p>The other memory involves lunching at a restaurant overlooking Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and my delight at seeing African Pied Wagtails foraging unconcernedly beneath the tables among the diners’ feet. Birders who have visited east and central African countries will have observed how closely the African Pied Wagtails there associate with human settlements and activities. From Zimbabwe southwards, they appear to become less confiding, perhaps because the option of associating with mankind is already exploited (albeit to a lesser extent) by the Cape Wagtail.</p><p>The other memory involves lunching at a restaurant overlooking Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and my delight at seeing African Pied Wagtails foraging unconcernedly beneath the tables among the diners’ feet.

From Zimbabwe southwards, they appear to become less confiding, perhaps because the option of associating with mankind is already exploited (albeit to a lesser extent) by the Cape Wagtail.</p><p>Irrespective of where it is encountered, however, the African Pied Wagtail is an engaging bird. It is usually encountered in pairs or small groups, although sites with abundant food (such as water treatment works) can attract 100 or more of these birds. Foraging is mostly done on foot, with the tail ever bobbing up and down. The bird walks briskly or runs to catch insects, sometimes jumping in the air to snatch a flying insect overhead. Insects may also be hawked or plucked from the water surface in flight.</p><p>Both male and female defend an area of roughly 100 metres diameter around the nest, and the aggressive male will chase out any intruders that enter the larger territory of about 1-2 ha: this is usually a linear territory along a river. African Pied Wagtails are noted for their intolerance of their own images in vehicle wing mirrors or shiny hubcaps, and an irate breeding male may become so obsessed with a reflected image that cannot be chased away that he seriously neglects his share of brood care and provisioning.</p><p>Although natural nest sites are most often used, the African Pied Wagtail is also adept at and imaginative about utilising man’s structures. At marinas and along rivers this species regularly nests on boats, often under the ‘roof’ at the prow, with the sitting bird happily staying put when the boat goes out. They have also been observed using ledges in buildings near water, and in one instance a pair built a nest in the box containing the switchgear for a pump in the water below! Under these circumstances they become very tame.</p><p>In spite of (or perhaps because of) their staunch defence of a breeding territory, the African Pied Wagtail is a widespread and successful species. In some areas it breeds almost throughout the year, and has a larger average clutch size than many other African songbirds of its size. A bird in Malawi was retrapped alive and well 10.5 years after being ringed.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Pipit is undoubtedly the most frequently encountered pipit in the region, and one of the most numerous grassland bird species in general. It occurs throughout southern Africa, with the exception of the Namib Desert, and is common in natural or modified grassland. It prefers flat or gently sloping terrain, and relatively short, cropped, mown or burned grass is essential as longer grass makes its terrestrial foraging difficult or impractical. As such it is often commonest on heavily grazed fields, where plentiful animal dung attracts a multitude of insects, as well as on trampled ground around water holes, dams or salt pans, on open floodplains and in recently burned grassland.</p><p>North of our borders, the African Pipit’s distribution extends across much of the continent and to the Arabian Peninsula. In Eurasia and Australasia it is replaced by the Richard’s and related pipits. Considering its extensive range, it is not surprising that a number of subspecies have been described, five of which occur in southern Africa.</p><p>North of our borders, the African Pipit’s distribution extends across much of the continent and to the Arabian Peninsula. In Eurasia and Australasia it is replaced by the Richard’s and related pipits. Considering its extensive range, it is not surprising that a number of subspecies have been described, five of which occur in southern Africa.</p><p>One useful method of distinguishing the superficially similar but unrelated families of larks and pipits, is to keep in mind that the pipits are closely related to wagtails. Indeed, watching a foraging African Pipit will reveal such family ties: both pipits and wagtails have delicate bodies and bills, walk horizontally with their heads pumping back and forth, and frequently wag their long tails. Every so often they stand momentarily upright and wag their white-sided tails – a habit that might assist in flushing their insect prey from hiding. They seldom drink but frequently bathe in water or loose soil.</p><p>The field identification of pipits is notoriously difficult and it is, therefore, important to familiarise oneself with the common African Pipit as a comparative standard. The most important characteristics to look for are its small size, yellow bill base, well-marked face and back, clearly streaked breast, white outer tail feathers and long hind claw. However, even two neighbouring African Pipits seldom look identical, and their appearance varies considerably according to age, plumage wear and location.</p><p>Depending on rainfall, fires and human activities, African Pipits may breed year-round, with a peak in early to midsummer. At the onset of the breeding season, males perform energetic display flights. Sometimes starting before dawn, the male ascends some 50&#160;m and then cruises in a circle over his territory, in an undulating or dipping path. During each dip, he utters a string of quick notes, which are repeated in a continuous stream while diving back towards the ground. As in most pipits, this species also has a distinctive flight call.</p><p>The small nest cup is usually hidden in a hollow at the base of a grass tuft and is shadowed by overhanging grass blades. It is constructed mainly by the female, who can complete the job in three or four days. Adults may perform injury-feigning displays to distract predators from the nest, swaying with open wings while calling insistently. Pairs’ annual breeding success is 30-40%, owing largely to predators and accidental trampling by large animals.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>At about 8 a.m. on a drippy, overcast November morning, I swung off the Gondola-Beira road to drive along a gravel track through tall miombo woodland. The woodland quickly thickened into some luxuriant-looking tall evergreen forest – the Amatongas Forest. This was the destination for the day, and it was looking good. Something flew across the track at about bonnet height, just in front of the car, stimulating a “WAZZAT?” thought. It was about the size of a thrush, but it wasn’t familiar.</p><p>A little further on there was a widening of the track where I could park the car without causing obstruction, and I was soon inside the forest, looking and listening. I came across a large domed nest about 2 metres up in the top of a shrub, and an African Pitta flew out of it as I approached. I was able to lean the shrub somewhat and feel into the nest to find two warm eggs. Thus it was that in the space of an hour I had seen my first two African Pittas, and the nest and eggs.</p><p>A little further on there was a widening of the track where I could park the car without causing obstruction, and I was soon inside the forest, looking and listening.

I was able to lean the shrub somewhat and feel into the nest to find two warm eggs. Thus it was that in the space of an hour I had seen my first two African Pittas, and the nest and eggs.</p><p>That was a long time ago. Nowadays, the African Pitta is ranked as one of the most sought-after ‘ticks’ in southern Africa. And, according to some of the literature: it is a secretive skulker of the gloomiest reaches of the forest undergrowth. How much is actually known about this bird?</p><p>The African Pitta is a summer visitor to southern Africa, breeding in regions north of the Limpopo River in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It is a nocturnal migrant, and sometimes suffers the ‘lighthouse’ effect of being drawn to artificial lights in cloudy conditions. This species is recorded on migration in the Marondera area, particularly along the top of the watershed. Some die by hitting windows at night, but others appear to stop to forage as they spend a day in a garden and then disappear. Some individuals overshoot their destinations and are encountered in various localities in South Africa. The birds arrive on their breeding grounds in October and usually leave in February or early March, with a few laggards leaving in April.</p><p>African Pittas call only in the early morning and around sunset. The male is the vocalist, and in the breeding season he precedes his call with rapid wing claps as he leaps into the air, usually from a low branch, giving what  has been lavishly described as “an abrupt, loud, deep, mellow, liquid, ascending trill ‘ffrrueep’ ”. On landing, he slowly raises and lowers his short tail, with the entire display showing off his extravagant plumage to good effect.</p><p>To find this silent, ground-foraging bird, one must not stomp around in the forest. It is much better to sit quietly in an open glade and wait for the bird to come into view. Galun Rathbun did this in Kenya when studying the behaviour of Golden-rumped Elephant-Shrews, and he saw a lot of local forest birds in the process, including African Pittas. Kenya is in the pitta’s non-breeding area, and Rathbun observed that they frequented glades carpeted with leaf litter. In spite of their beautiful colours, they evidently blend incredibly well with the dappled light on the forest floor. If disturbed, a foraging pitta flies ‘reluctantly’ to a low perch. Their foraging behaviour is thrush-like; the bird stands motionless in deep leaf litter, with its head cocked to one side, then suddenly darts off with long hops, and plunges its beak into the soil, often to catch an earthworm.</p><p>Earthworms can be found within beak’s reach only in damp soil, so if earthworms are a major dietary item, pittas will not inhabit thickets on dry ground, or in areas where large animals such as elephants open up the vegetation and compact the soil.</p>",

It does have an arched bill like a goose and perches regularly on logs and in trees, but otherwise it is very much a perching duck. It is a subtropical to tropical species which is only really common in the Okavango Delta within our region.</p><p>They are our most handsome little ducks. The male has a white face with a green crown, nape and hind neck. The back is also green while the breast and underparts are a bright chestnut colour. The bill is a very clear yellow. The female is somewhat duller although she also has the bright chestnut underparts. In flight both sexes show clean white windows at the back of the wing. Their small size and obvious duck-like characteristics make identification of this species relatively simple.</p><p>They are our most handsome little ducks.

Their small size and obvious duck-like characteristics make identification of this species relatively simple.</p><p>This species is usually found in wetlands with clear water, both in rivers, pans and dams with emergent vegetation creating islands, and with vegetation along the banks.  They normally require floating vegetation, particularly water lilies Nymphacea spp. Like all our ducks they are nomadic and may appear on wetlands following rain throughout the north-eastern third of southern Africa. Because they are found among water lilies, their small size makes them inconspicuous and they may be overlooked as they sit very still among the water lily flowers. The birds are usually found in pairs or in small groups but at certain times they may occur in huge flocks, probably the result of wetlands drying out over an area and the birds being concentrated in the remaining wetlands. In the Okavango Delta I have seen flocks of hundreds of this species but this would be the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>It appears that the African Pygmy Goose feeds to a very large extent on the buds, pods and seeds of the water lilies, using their sharp hook-tipped beak to cut stems and pods off the plants. They are adept at finding seeds by diving, and have also been recorded as stripping seeds off the water lilies and feeding on them at the surface.</p><p>This species is interesting in that they nest in holes in trees, which is uncommon in ducks in southern Africa. In other parts of the world there are a number of hole-nesting ducks. The birds require a nest hole which they can block with their body, and therefore the nest hole needs to be about 12 cm in diameter. Inside the tree the hole needs to be somewhat bigger. It is presumed that the blocking of the nest hole is important to stop bees and other insects from getting into the nest. This requirement limits the places where this species may nest. On the Zimbabwe plateau we found that they were rare nesters because the trees seldom had holes big enough. In the Save Valley where there were areas of very large mopane trees which would be standing in water following heavy rain, there were plenty of suitably sized holes, and the African Pygmy Geese nested there regularly. However, this only occurred following heavy rain when the mopane veld was flooded. If the nest was some distance from the nearest water, the chicks would jump out of the nest and walk with the adults to the nearest water. This species has also been recorded as nesting in holes in cliffs and in old nests built by Hamerkops, but the majority of nesting is in natural holes in large trees. Nesting is usually in summer to coincide with the summer rains.</p>",

In April, they head north into the woodlands of central Africa during our winter months. They are the smallest kingfishers found in southern African and are one of the jewels of the woodlands. There is no woodland species with which this kingfisher can be confused – its tiny size, bright blue back, violet-washed ear coverts and long, red bill are diagnostic.</p><p>The species is found throughout the woodlands of the eastern and north-eastern parts of southern Africa, where it is usually associated with clearings. They can, however, also become common in urban areas where there are trees and banks for nesting.

One was found below a window on Thesen Island in Knysna – the only record from the southern Cape!</p><p>Like the other woodland kingfishers, this species usually hunts from a perch at no great height above the ground, and the brilliant blue flash as the bird drops down and alights on the ground next to its prey, is often the first indication that the bird is present. However, the birds are small enough to be easily overlooked when perched. One farmer, who drew my attention to this species, only learned about the bird’s presence when it came to bathe in the fish pond in the farmhouse garden. The bird was not chasing the fish, as the farmer thought, but having a bath. It sat on a perch nearby and ‘belly-flopped’ into the water to wet its belly and wings, before returning to its perch to preen. The process was repeated many times, and it seems likely that the bird was nesting nearby and was ridding itself of mites picked up in the nest.</p><p>Most well-developed woodland areas seem to have pairs scattered throughout. Experience in the Miombo woodlands of Zimbabwe shows that the density of this species is not related so much to the availability of food – of which there seems to be plenty – as to the presence of suitable sand banks where the birds can excavate their nest. The birds will build a nest in almost any sandy bank and are particularly fond of the roof of Aardvark and similar burrows if these are available. I have even found one nesting in a burrow no more than 200 mm in diameter! The construction of predator-proof fences may reduce Aardvark numbers, and the reduction in thenumber of burrows available will affectkingfisher breeding adversely. However, my experience has been that the provision of suitable artificial banks within the woodland results in an increase in the numbers of breeding pairs.</p><p>When photographing this species at the nest, it was noticeable that they always landed on the same perch on their way to the nest with food. This enabled the adult to check for danger before entering the nest. We noticed that when feeding chicks in the nest, the adults brought mainly grasshoppers, with the back legs pulled off, probably because the legs were very hard and indigestible. When the bird emerged from the nest it nearly always alighted on the same perch that it used when approaching the nest.</p>",

They are so terrestrial in their choice of habitat that they do not perch, even on grass stems, save in most unusual circumstances. But this makes it very difficult to see the birds and admire the attractive face markings of the male. Most sightings are of small dark birds with white outer tail feathers which rise at your feet, quickly gather height and fly up, up and away.</p><p>Most waxbills and small finches react to danger by diving for cover into the nearest bush. But quail-finches live in wide-open areas where there is seldom any cover available. Moreover among the principal sources of danger are harriers and Black-shouldered Kites. Danger, therefore, comes from above and the movement of fleeing for what limited cover may be available would simply reveal their presence. So, in the face of such danger, they freeze and keep absolutely still. For some reason, if the danger is ground-based, the birds tend to present their barred posteriors towards the source of the threat. Perhaps this breaks up the silhouette of the bird or conceals the conspicuous head and beak colours.</p><p>Most waxbills and small finches react to danger by diving for cover into the nearest bush.

Perhaps this breaks up the silhouette of the bird or conceals the conspicuous head and beak colours.</p><p>It is this freezing behaviour that leads to the name ‘quail-finch’ because, like true quails, they often do not flush and take to flight until one has almost stepped on them. In East Africa they were at one time called ‘Partridge Finches’, a name which reflects not only the flocking tendencies that they share with partridges, but also the way that a flock of quail-finches tends to flush in sections. You may flush four or five birds together while six more stay quite still and silent on the ground. Scan the ground with your binoculars but you will still find it difficult to pick one up visually. Take another few steps and another handful of birds will take to the air. Take a few more steps and only then may the rest of the group take to flight.</p><p>While it is difficult to get a good view of an African Quail-Finch face-on or broadside, they can always be identified from their calls. Vocalisation is an important part of quail-finch behaviour and the loudest calls, given in flight, have a very characteristic metallic quality which is not shared with any other bird in these habitats, save for Melodious Larks which mimic quail-finches. The birds do call on the ground but these calls tend to be softer because they are directed at fellow quail-finches nearby. Calls given in flight may be single notes or a series of five or six single notes delivered with little pattern and little hurry. In a 1993 Ostrich paper, Rick Nuttall identified multiple different functions for the various calls. Interesting points include the fact that it is possible to distinguish the calls of individual birds and that paired males and females have sex-specific calls. There are flight-intention calls given on the ground, take-off calls uttered as the birds flush, and in-flight calls. The latter are given as they move from one vlei to another, and a feature of these calls is that phrases are made up of high-pitched and lower notes seemingly mixed at random. Nuttall talked of ‘djinks’ and ‘djus’ – I prefer ‘klinks’ and ‘klunks’. A bird flying on its own is more likely to utter both ‘klinks’ and ‘klunks’ in an extended series of notes than is an individual bird flying in a flock. The varied calls emanating from a flock are made up of single ‘klinks’ and single ‘klunks’ uttered by different members of the flock.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The favoured habitats of the African Rail are not particularly pleasant places in which to be! They include river systems fringed with extensive beds of reeds and rushes, dams which have been poorly maintained and constantly release water into open swampland below, municipal water reticulation systems that leak, and sewerage pipes that block and overflow into grassland. Such places that are permanently wet support vigorous growths of tall cover, extending over your head. Although it is hard work to force one’s way through the tangle of new and old reed and rush stems, the conditions down below at ground or water level are relatively open. Clumps of plant stems down there are distributed at intervals of 10-20 cm and only develop a spreading growth at about waist height, leaving plenty of room for birds to run or swim about. But birds nonetheless have to push their way through belts of denser vegetation so the bodies of the ground-dwelling birds that live in these habitats are laterally compressed, hence the expression ‘as thin as a rail’.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is where you will find African Rails. You will hear them first among the many other calls coming from the same habitat. These include those of Little Rush Warblers, Lesser Swamp Warblers, African Reed Warblers and, in summer, Great Reed Warblers. There are also grunts and snorts coming from Purple Swamphens and African Moorhens. Frequent cackling and wheezing choruses announce the Black Crakes and the soft, monotonous call is that of the Red-chested Flufftail. The African Rails’ arresting contributions to all these sounds are loud bursts comprising a descending cascade of gabbles and trills, interspersed with short pauses after each phrase as the call winds down in speed and volume. One bird calls and another frequently joins in, and then another may add its piece.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is where you will find African Rails.

One bird calls and another frequently joins in, and then another may add its piece.</p><p>The birds do periodically come out of their reed-bed retreats and show themselves on exposed mud banks or in shallow channels. They move with brisk, high-stepping strides and constantly probe their long, bright red bills into the mud, into tufts of grass or sedge and into debris caught up from earlier floods. If agitated, they flick their tails up and down. At times they will clamber three metres and more up the reed stems to dry off in the early morning sun.</p><p>Like most crakes and rails, when African Rails hatch they are clothed in black down which protects them for the first ten days or so until their feathers grow. The chicks spend a couple of days in the nest waiting for all the eggs to hatch and gathering strength to cope with the uneven conditions into which they will be moving. These youngsters do not start pecking from the ground immediately like day-old gamebird chicks, but have to start life by being fed beak-to-beak. It is dark down there where they live, and half a dozen black chicks against a damp dark background are not easy to find. Consequently, most of these very small chicks have contrasting white marks on their bills: different species, different patterns of black and white or pink. When the parent comes along with food the chicks chirp and sway their heads from side to side to show where they are rather than sticking a wide open mouth into mother’s face.  Those beak marks are initially accentuated by a white egg tooth at the tip of the bill but that falls off within days. Rail chicks begin life with a bright pink bill, tipped black.</p> ",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Red-eyed Bulbul is near-endemic to southern Africa, also occurring in extreme south-western Zambia and southern Angola. Its southern African distribution encompasses Namibia, most of Botswana, north-western Zimbabwe, and South Africa from western Limpopo Province, North West Province and Gauteng, south through the Karoo and Lesotho lowlands, the Drakensberg escarpment in the Eastern Cape Province and the fold mountains of the eastern parts of Western Cape Province. The birds avoid the Namib Desert and most of the western Succulent Karoo. The distribution of the African Red-eyed Bulbul overlaps with that of the Dark-Capped Bulbul in north-eastern Botswana, in the higher altitude areas of northern South Africa, and the Eastern Cape. In the Eastern Cape and southern parts of the Western Cape, African Red-eyed Bulbuls also overlap with the Cape Bulbul. Hybrids between African Red-eyed Bulbuls, Dark-capped Bulbuls and Cape Bulbuls have been recorded. At Prince Albert in the southern Karoo, where African Red-eyed Bulbuls and Cape Bulbuls are both present (and occasionally hybridise), African Red-eyed Bulbuls are more common than Cape Bulbuls in the surrounding rural areas than in the village, but in the village both species occur commonly in gardens.</p><p>Movements of African Red-eyed Bulbuls appear to be complex. Flocks wander widely during the non-breeding season and during droughts. Large seasonal influxes into Botswana’s Okavango Delta have been recorded, and almost all records of the species in north-western Zimbabwe are from the dry season, indicating possible seasonal movement from Botswana. The birds may be nomadic in response to environmental conditions, moving not only away from drought, but also towards areas that have experienced good rains.</p><p>Movements of African Red-eyed Bulbuls appear to be complex.

The birds may be nomadic in response to environmental conditions, moving not only away from drought, but also towards areas that have experienced good rains.</p><p>African Red-eyed Bulbuls occur in dry woodlands, Acacia woodlands along dry watercourses in the Karoo, and dry shrublands along drainage lines in treeless areas. They tolerate transformation of their natural habitat very well, and nest and feed in croplands, gardens, alien vegetation and plantations. In gardens in villages and at farmstead oases in the semi-arid Karoo they make use of the available facilities such as birdbaths and bird feeders. They often draw attention to themselves with excited contact calling, especially from large groups gathered at fruiting trees, and when mobbing snakes.</p><p>They forage in pairs or in groups with other frugivorous birds, and occasionally, when food is scarce, forage alone. Their diet is mainly fruit, and they eat a wide variety of wild and cultivated fruits. Most berries and larger fruits are taken from the ends of branches in the canopy, but some fruits, such as those of the Creeping Saltbush Atriplex semibaccata, are taken on the ground. Fruits of alien trees, including Pepper Tree Schinus molle, Ivy Hedera helix and Persian Lilac Melia azedrach are frequently eaten. They also take flowers, nectar, and some insects, including termite alates hawked in the air. They are water dependent, and thus not usually found far from water in the drier areas. The birds approach a drinking site cautiously, first flying to the top of a tree, and then working their way down to the water.</p><p>Nests of African Red-eyed Bulbuls are solitary, and the birds defend a territory around the nest. The nest is a rather flimsy-looking cup of grasses and rootlets, sometimes with pieces of orange baling twine and paper in the framework, or strands of Old Man’s Beard Galium tomentosum, all held together with a light covering of spider web. The nest is usually placed in a fork in a bush or tree, frequently in Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo trees in the southern Karoo, sometimes on a grapevine or inside a large plumbago bush. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, and both parents feed the nestlings.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>If asked what the most fascinating avian genus is, I suspect many ornithologists, taxonomists and geneticists, and of course birders, would opt for Acrocephalus. Undoubtedly non-birders would be surprised at this answer, and for good reason: reed warblers are exceedingly difficult to identify, are dull and nondescript without exception, and lack memorable displays or behavioural quirks. Ironically, their popularity is because of the above-mentioned truths: they are irresistibly challenging to identify, and have captivating and infinitely complex songs.</p><p>A case in point is the widespread and common African Reed Warbler. Birders correctly consider this sub-Saharan species and its Palaearctic-breeding counterpart, the Eurasian Reed Warbler, indistinguishable in the field. In fact, the plumage and voices of the two are so similar that the birds themselves have trouble distinguishing each other, responding to each other’s songs, for example. Even in the hand, the only reliable diagnostic feature of the African species is its shorter wing, with the exposed length of the primary feathers only about 40% the length of the tertial feathers (not 70% as in Eurasian Reed Warbler). The shorter wing is a reflection of African’s  resident status or short-distance migration, as opposed to Eurasian’s inter-continental odyssey.</p><p>A case in point is the widespread and common African Reed Warbler.

The shorter wing is a reflection of African’s  resident status or short-distance migration, as opposed to Eurasian’s inter-continental odyssey.</p><p>To this scant list of distinguishing factors can be added differences in the timing of moult, slight subspecific colour differences, and perhaps variations in the species mimicked in males’ songs. But why should they be considered two species at all? Recent discoveries of intermediate reed warblers in Morocco and Libya further complicate the picture. Some authorities maintain that all these variants would better be considered a single wide-ranging species.</p><p>But the African Reed Warbler can still be appreciated and enjoyed without getting bogged down in taxonomic quagmires. It is one of the most common wetland warblers, breeding in even small strips of reeds, rushes or sedges along streams or around small farm dams in arid areas. It seems equally at home in virtually any wetland, marsh or reed bed, be it in coastal, temperate or tropical areas. However, it avoids deep permanent swamps and is more often found in shallowly flooded reed beds or vegetation over muddy soil. The coastal suahelicus race is a mangrove specialist. These warblers frequently forage in trees or scrub adjacent to wetlands, and in the non-breeding season they are sometimes found in suburban gardens, woodland thickets and sugar cane fields.</p><p>The easiest way to locate and identify this species is by the male’s rhythmic, structured song in which the same element is repeated a few times before switching to the next: ‘one-one-one, two-two-two, three-three-three’. Singing may continue intermittently for hours, and sometimes even at night. Singing becomes especially intense at the onset of the summer breeding season, and subsides after pairing. When excited, singers often briefly sidle up a reed to scan their surroundings, but for the most part they remain concealed. They may also be glimpsed while flitting between adjacent patches of reeds, or in flight low above the water. Their diet consists primarily of insects which are picked from vegetation or the water surface, or briefly pursued in flight.</p><p>African Reed Warblers are found singly, in pairs or in small family groups, but several pairs may occur in close proximity in prime habitats, creating the impression of loose colonies. Indeed, neighbouring nests may be built less than 50 metres apart. Interestingly, around 10% of breeding pairs are assisted by an unrelated, usually male, helper. Support by such helpers can raise breeding success by as much as 50%. The nest is a bulky mass of dry strips of vegetation surrounding a neater inner cup lined with finer material. Nests are usually attached to upright stems, 0.6-1.5 metres up.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Southern Africa boasts more than two hundred species that can be considered ‘Little Brown Jobs’. Experts will repeatedly stress the importance of considering a mystery bird’s habitat, range, shape, size and especially voice. Unfortunately there is one dreaded group of birds that seem to disregard all of these important identification criteria: the large brown pipits. These daunting birds have widely overlapping ranges; several species may be found in the same habitat; they are very similar in shape, size, build and colour; and worst of all, they all have similar, simple songs.</p><p>One exception to this discouraging outlook is the charismatic African Rock Pipit. For a start, its song is melodious, musical and utterly unmistakable, and is undoubtedly the best way of locating this sometimes furtive species. Song phrases consist of a pure, even or slightly ascending whistle that increases in volume, followed by a stuttering trill. Each phrase lasts approximately 1.5 seconds and is repeated every few seconds. Despite the apparent simplicity of this phrase, the birds can convey much information through subtle variations in the song’s composition.</p><p>One exception to this discouraging outlook is the charismatic African Rock Pipit.

Each phrase lasts approximately 1.5 seconds and is repeated every few seconds. Despite the apparent simplicity of this phrase, the birds can convey much information through subtle variations in the song’s composition.</p><p>African Rock Pipits are closely related to Striped Pipits, as evidenced by their melodic voices, yellow feather edges, rocky habitats and several morphological features. The distribution ranges of the two species are neatly complementary, with minimal overlap. Unlike its Striped relative, the African Rock Pipit prefers open, treeless slopes in the arid interior and higher-lying escarpment. It occurs locally on the sparsely vegetated hills, koppies and mountains of the Karoo, extending eastwards to the montane grasslands and alpine heath of the Drakensberg range. In the mountain kingdom of Lesotho it is one of the most common terrestrial passerines, even at altitudes exceeding 3&#160;000 m, occurring at densities of about one pair in 15 hectares. Further north it occurs locally in Mpumalanga and south-eastern Gauteng. Several isolated populations have recently been discovered in the Northern Cape.</p><p>Hearing an African Rock Pipit and getting reasonable views of one, are two different challenges altogether. While it is less shy than impatient birders often claim, it is adept at disappearing behind rocks or into grassy cover when pursued; often the best strategy is to sit and wait patiently for the birds to appear. Scanning prominent rocks for the distinctive upright silhouette of singing males, with their bills pointed skywards, may also prove fruitful.</p><p>It is resident, and in the winter non-breeding season may be more confiding and can often be studied at length. One winter I enjoyed the somewhat surreal experience of watching an African Rock Pipit and an Eastern Rock Elephant-shrew, simultaneously on the hunt for insects on a rock outcrop near Heidelberg, Gauteng – with a blaring rock concert in full swing directly below me!</p><p>The nest is expertly concealed in or against a grass tuft growing on a rocky slope. It is a shallow cup constructed of grass blades, small twigs and other coarser plant material, with an inner cup lined with finer vegetation. In October to January, or earlier in the winter rainfall zone, a clutch of two to three speckled eggs is laid; the eggs hatch after 12-13 days and the chicks leave the warmth of the nest after a similar period.</p><p>The African Rock Pipit is endemic to South Africa and Lesotho, and has a total estimated global breeding population of 5&#160;000 to 10&#160;000 birds. Despite its comparatively small population and restricted range, a red flag for most grassland birds, this species is not currently considered threatened. This is in part because its habitat of steep, rocky mountain slopes in arid or alpine climates is unsuitable for agriculture. However, the effects of climate change may prove detrimental to this, and other mountain-loving, species in the future.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>It has to be said upfront that there is little about the African Sacred Ibis that is visually attractive. The bird invariably has an ungroomed look about it, no more so than when in breeding plumage, its feeding habits are unsavoury, its hoarse, wheezy call is decidedly unpleasant to listen to, its black head gives the bird an eyeless appearance, and its long, black scythe-like bill recalls the arrival of the grim reaper. This, though, is merely a personal and probably not a universally-held view. If the birds have any redeeming features for me, it would be when they are in the air, either soaring effortlessly in an updraft, or flying purposefully in a long, ribbon-like line, or in a V-shaped skein – a hundred or more birds in formation, arranged one behind the other, each benefiting by the tailwind created by the bird in front of it. Here the black head, black legs and black-edged wings graphically define each bird and there’s a precision about such formation flying – the steady, symmetrical wing beats, the silent forward movement of the V, and the periodic change in leadership whereby the front bird drops back a place and the bird behind it moves forward – that is appealing.</p><p>African Sacred Ibises commute daily and seasonally; on the one hand moving daily back and forth between roost site and foraging area, up to 30 km each leg, and on the other there is evidence that some birds commute long-distances seasonally between summer and winter grounds. Monitoring of the numbers at roost sites on the Witwatersrand, for example, has shown that the winter population in the region is only half that of the summer population, and there are many recoveries of birds ringed here and recovered in winter in Zambia, to suggest that this winter exodus heads in that direction.</p><p>African Sacred Ibises commute daily and seasonally; on the one hand moving daily back and forth between roost site and foraging area, up to 30 km each leg, and on the other there is evidence that some birds commute long-distances seasonally between summer and winter grounds.

There are also other similar-looking, closely related white ibises found in Asia (Black-headed Ibis) and Australia (Australian White Ibis). All are primarily wetland birds but the African Sacred Ibis has adapted widely in southern Africa to man-modified environments, and it commonly forages at rubbish dumps, stock feedlots, piggeries, sewage disposal works, abattoirs, and the like. Much of what it feeds on here doesn’t bear repeating. It is also a nest robber of note in mixed-species heronries and in breeding colonies of terns and gulls, preying on the eggs and nestlings of other birds. On the other hand, when foraging in the shallow margins of lakes and pans, or in wet meadows or at inter-tidal pools at the coast, its diet is more benign, comprising insects and their larvae, fish, frogs, crustaceans, molluscs and such items.</p><p>At the start of the breeding cycle African Sacred Ibises undergo a number of plumage and colour changes. The loose, feathery black scapular plumes acquire a bluish metallic sheen, the flank feathers become washed with sulphurous yellow and the area of bare skin along the underwing, only visible when the wings are spread, becomes crimson. During this period males also inflate their throats to a grotesque size. The birds are gregarious year-round and they invariably nest colonially, these usually comprising 10-50 pairs, less often numbering hundreds and even thousands of pairs. Such sites are often shared with other colonial breeders, especially African Spoonbills. Nesting is well synchronised within the colony and both sexes share the incubation and nestling care. The entire nesting cycle lasts about three months, after which there is widespread dispersal until the next breeding season comes around.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Weighing much the same as a thrush – about 65 grams – the African Scops Owl is the region’s (and the African continent’s) smallest species of owl. It is a truly diminutive owl but what this tiny predator lacks in size it makes up for in weaponry, having powerful claws and a strongly hooked beak that serve it well in catching the wide range of prey on which it subsists. It is typically owl-like in appearance, with an upright stance, a large head, its plumage bark-like in appearance and cryptically patterned in shades of grey, black and in some individuals buff, bright yellow eyes set in a distinct facial disc and a pair of feather tufts on its head that can be retracted but usually project upwards in the form of two “ears”.</p><p>During the day these owls remain immobile, perched among the branches of a tree, usually selecting a position up against a stem where they merge with their background. They enhance their invisibility by drawing their body feathers in and by closing their eyes down to such thin slits that they appear to be asleep and, unless one knows their exact whereabouts, they are very easily overlooked. They have the habit, though, of returning daily to roost at the same site so once a bird has been located, it can usually be seen there day after day, even month after month.</p><p>During the day these owls remain immobile, perched among the branches of a tree, usually selecting a position up against a stem where they merge with their background.

They have the habit, though, of returning daily to roost at the same site so once a bird has been located, it can usually be seen there day after day, even month after month.</p><p>By night African Scops Owls come alive, and the call they make is one of the more evocative sounds to be heard after dark in the bushveld country that the birds frequent. The call is a single short, far-carrying note, a frog-like ‘kruup’ or ‘pruup’ repeated at intervals of 5-8 seconds; one bird calling nearby may be answered by others in the distance, and at some times of the year calling may continue through the night. For me, the call evokes images of a particular sunset, acacia trees etched against the last shades of a salmon sky, the smell and flicker of a campfire, and the memory of stirring in the early hours of the morning to discover the sound has not abated.</p><p>African Scops Owl’s primary prey comprises a wide range of arthropods – crickets, sunspiders, moths, beetles, centipedes, mantids and the like – which are caught by swooping onto them from a low perch. They also prey on small birds, small rodents, lizards and frogs. Being strictly nocturnal, they are not easily observed while hunting, and much of what is known of their diet is from observations made at nests where young were being fed; in one instance 70 such items were brought in a night and in another, the parents brought 66 such items to the chicks in a seven-hour watch. As one might expect, the usual nest site is a hole in a tree, typically a natural cavity rather than a disused woodpecker hole, although this occasionally happens, and nest boxes are sometimes used.</p><p>The nesting cycle much resembles that of other owls. The female lays 2-4 eggs and once incubation commences the birds become relatively silent. She incubates without male assistance and is provisioned by the male who delivers about 20 prey items to her each night. If a nest is inspected with a light the female often sits tight rather than fleeing, facing down and relying on her cryptic plumage to conceal her. The entire nest cycle, from laying to fledging, takes nearly two months to complete, and for the remainder of the year until the next breeding season, these endearing little owls lead largely solitary lives with little evidence to show that they move about widely or undergo any migrations.</p>",

Found in the extreme north of our region from Namibia, through Botswana to Zimbabwe, it occurs northwards to the Sudan and the Sahel zone. In southern Africa, its breeding range has retreated northwards. Historically it bred in Mozambique, and may still do so, but it has been extinct as a breeding species in South Africa since the 1940s.</p><p>Southern birds are intra-African migrants, but their movements have been modified by man-made alterations to their aquatic habitats. Dam-building, for example, has flooded much suitable habitat on one hand but at the same time created more permanent habitat. This has allowed for a proportion of the population to become nomadic, rather than migratory, during the summer wet season, when normally all natural habitats would have been flooded. During periods of drought some habitat may also remain available through the summer, allowing birds to remain in the area. This has made it very difficult to obtain an overall assessment of breeding numbers and success from year to year: flocks may not provide answers as many of these birds are non-breeders.</p><p>Southern birds are intra-African migrants, but their movements have been modified by man-made alterations to their aquatic habitats.

Feeding occurs mostly in the evening and at night. On the Kafue River in Zambia I have found birds feeding over the shallows on pitch-black nights. Obviously, the tactile senses of the lower mandible come into play over and above eyesight, although the bird does have large eyes, presumably enabling it to see well under low light conditions. They have a powerful, languid flight and maintain a constant height over water when hunting, with the tip of the elongated lower mandible submerged, ready to snap up any unwary fish at the moment of contact.</p><p>It is not known to what age these birds live, nor is there any indication at what age they may breed, but based on information for other large terns, they have the potential to live to 30 years of age, and probably breed for the first time when they are five or six years old. It is also unknown whether individuals breed every year. In at least some years if suitable breeding habitat is unavailable the birds cannot breed.  Breeding is either solitary or semi-colonial and takes place on exposed, bare sand-banks during the hottest period of the year.</p><p>Suitable sites, initially only slightly above the water’s edge, are chosen so that the sand is still slightly damp to help cool the eggs. However, as incubation progresses and water levels continue to drop, this too will dry out. The dry sand enables the bird to make a steep-sided scrape in which the two eggs are laid. Incubation is by both sexes and, as air temperatures rise during the day, spells on the nest are increasingly short, sometimes only a few minutes. In very hot weather, to aid in cooling of the eggs or young, birds wet their belly feathers before coming onto the nest. Breeding success is likely to be low because birds face many hardships such as trampling by game, especially Hippopotamus, flooding, and predation by Water Monitors and herons. On the upper Zambezi it was found that the chicks were being used as fishing bait!</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The African Snipe forms one of a group of very closely related species found widely in both the Old and New Worlds. Taxonomists have varied over the years in accepting from one to eight species. Current thinking is that they form a group of five species with two in the Americas and one each in Eurasia, Africa and Madagascar. The African Snipe has been poorly studied, but is divided into three subspecies with no geographical overlap in breeding range, all of which are represented in southern Africa. One is found only in South Africa and marginally into south-east Botswana (nominate nigripennis), the second in Zimbabwe (aequatorialis), and the third in northern Botswana, Namibia and north-west Zimbabwe, extending northwards to Angola, Zambia and the eastern Congo (angolensis). There appears to be very little, if any, movement between the ranges of each subspecies. The taxonomic confusion within this entire group shows just how great the similarity is between them, and the situation is ripe for a serious study of their genetics.</p><p>Loose post-breeding assemblages of African Snipes may occur, but the birds rarely occur in flocks, and nowhere are they really common. The highest densities probably occur on the Nyl River floodplain in Limpopo Province during years of high water levels. Where they go to during drought periods is somewhat of a mystery: generally they occur at very low densities and may be very scattered over the isolated patches of suitable marshland habitat. The only population that shows seasonal movements is that of angolensis which moves northwards into Zambia during the wet season, returning in about July. The other races show purely local movements and, during long spells of drought, mortality is likely to be high. During the extreme drought of 1972/73 in Zimbabwe birds were too weak to move in search of suitable alternative habitat. The population became seriously reduced as breeding was probably not possible, and death by starvation would have afflicted the older birds. It took two subsequent years of good rains for the population to recover. In Zimbabwe in drier years they breed at the end of the rains, and following seasons of high rainfall and higher water levels they breed in late winter. In South Africa it is interesting to see how quickly these birds respond to rainfall filling marshes and pans. Even if these sites have been dry for years birds can arrive virtually overnight.</p><p>Loose post-breeding assemblages of African Snipes may occur, but the birds rarely occur in flocks, and nowhere are they really common.

The population of the nominate subspecies in South Africa has been provisionally estimated at 10&#160;000 to 25&#160;000 birds, a small figure for such a large area, showing just how limited is their marshland habitat. Because of its skulking habits it is an extremely difficult bird to monitor. Drainage and wetland reclamation are probably the greatest threats to the future of this bird although, to counter that, suitable marshland may form on some of the artificial water impoundments.</p><p>The behaviour exhibited by the male when establishing territory and advertising for a mate is very interesting. The male flies to considerable height, often in excess of 50 metres, and dives at great speed, causing the spread outer tail feathers to vibrate and make a drumming sound that can be heard for some distance. This behaviour occurs most frequently in the early morning and evening, and on bright moonlight nights.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Although very distinctly different in appearance to ibises, spoonbills belong to the same family, the Threskiornithidae, a family name that translates to “religious (threskos) bird (ornis)”, so-named for its most iconic member, the Sacred Ibis. There are just six spoonbill species in the World and in most cases just a single species occurs in each of the World’s biogeographic regions. In sub-Saharan Africa it is the African Spoonbill that is the representative; a widespread resident that shares the wetlands here north of the Equator in winter with the migratory Eurasian Spoonbill from the Palaearctic. It is one of the more colourful spoonbills, its all-white plumage offset by deep pink legs and feet, an area of darker pink bare facial skin surrounding the eye and on the forehead, and a pink rim to its otherwise greyish-pink bill. In some circumstances the bird reveals a small fluffy crest when it raises the head and nape feathers.</p><p>African Spoonbills occur widely across southern Africa and they are likely to turn up, at least occasionally, on virtually any sizable body of open fresh water, even appearing at times on ephemeral wetlands in arid areas. They favour open shallow water such as is found along the margins of lakes, pans, estuaries, lagoons and dams, and it is probable that the proliferation of man-made dams in the region has much benefited this bird. Ringing records show that these birds move about over distances of hundreds of kilometres and the unpredictability in their arrival and departure at many wetlands attests to their nomadic nature.</p><p>African Spoonbills occur widely across southern Africa and they are likely to turn up, at least occasionally, on virtually any sizable body of open fresh water, even appearing at times on ephemeral wetlands in arid areas.

Ringing records show that these birds move about over distances of hundreds of kilometres and the unpredictability in their arrival and departure at many wetlands attests to their nomadic nature.</p><p>The birds are gregarious by nature and sightings of single birds are the exception. A half dozen or more together would be more usual, and very occasionally one may encounter hundreds. As often as not, when African Spoonbills are encountered, they are inactive, standing in shallow water with heads tucked away under the scapulars. The unusually shaped bill is what sets spoonbills apart, and it is their unique tool for securing prey. When African Spoonbills forage they do so with vigour, walking or striding forward in shallow water while sweeping their slightly opened bill from left to right in the water. It is evidently a tactile form of detecting prey as every now and then the bill snaps closed over an unsighted prey item and it is thrown up with a backward flip of the head, caught in the throat, and then swallowed. Small fish, insect larvae, and other small aquatic creatures comprise the diet.</p><p>African Spoonbills invariably nest communally and they usually join other nesting herons, darters or cormorants in flooded trees or in reed beds when doing so. Their numbers at such colonies are usually small - between five and 30 pairs - but in many years of monitoring breeding colonies along the floodplain of the Nyl River in northern South Africa, I’ve twice had gatherings of over 200 nesting pairs here. In the winter rainfall region of the Cape, breeding occurs in spring and summer whereas elsewhere, while they may nest in any month, they are primarily winter breeders. The breeding cycle is typically that of a Threskiornithidae species in which the male collects nest material and the female builds the nest, both sexes incubate, and both brood and feed the nestlings. It has been reported that the male incubates during the day and the female at night. Soon after hatching the nestlings start showing the development of their unusual bill, and by three weeks of age its spoon shape is quite distinct. The breeding cycle takes a little over two months to complete and for several months thereafter young birds, usually seen accompanying adults, are easily distinguished from the adults by having dull black legs and black bills.</p>",

In southern Africa it occurs down the west coast, across the southern third of the country, up into KwaZulu-Natal and northwards through Zimbabwe into Zambia.</p><p>The male is a very handsome little bird with a black head and throat contrasting with a white patch below the ear and a bright rufous breast. The belly is grey and the upper tail coverts are white contrasting with the black tail. The female has a brownish head and a much less deep rufous breast, but the rufous extends further down onto the belly.

The female’s back is brown with a conspicuous white line along the length of the wing.</p><p>These birds occur mainly in open grasslands and areas with short bush, including much of the fynbos. Because of their habit of perching on the top of a bush or plant, they are conspicuous when present. In many areas they are common to very common, but in other rather similar-looking areas they are much less common or even absent altogether. The birds are generally tame and confiding around people, and they are considered to be a favourite by many who live in the country areas where they occur.</p><p>The birds are resident in most places except at higher altitudes in the mountains, from whence the birds move to lower levels during the winter months, perhaps because of lack of food brought about by cold weather.</p><p>Stonechats normally sit on a perch and either pounce on prey on the ground below or fly up from a perch to catch insects flying past. They have been recorded as eating an amazing variety of insects and their larvae, as well as spiders, earthworms and even tiny fish and lizards. Along the coast they have been observed catching insects on rocky areas and hawking insects from rocks in the inter-tidal zone.</p><p>They have a fairly loud call for their size, consisting of a variety of piping and trilling notes. This is given most commonly during the breeding season when the birds are defending a territory. Their name derives from their alarm call which sounds like rattling stones.</p><p>Stonechats usually build their nest in a very well hidden place among grass or other ground vegetation. The nest is a cup of warm material placed under overhanging grass, often at the base of a grass tuft. The birds never approach the nest directly, but land some distance away and walk through the ground cover to the nest. Consequently the nests are remarkably difficult to locate, even when the birds are coming and going all the time with insects for the chicks. In Zimbabwe, Stonechats always finish nesting well ahead of the main rains because the soil in the grasslands can become very wet during heavy rainstorms. We found that the first nests coincided with the flush of insects which occurred during August or September, at the beginning of spring when the brachystegia trees broke out in new leaves. The eggs need about fifteen days of incubation, and the chicks spend about the same amount of time in the nest before fledging, but thereafter need to be fed by the adults for several weeks before they become independent. Assuming that the same pair held the same territory, it was not unusual for a second nest to be built in the same general area in late September or early October. Some of these nests undoubtedly came to grief if we had early rains.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The ever-changing common names of southern African birds are an emotive topic among birders, but the shift from Purple Gallinule to African Swamphen is surely not controversial. It was once considered a single species throughout the warmer parts of the Old World, but was subsequently split into several species, and this is the reason for the name change. However, the new name is particularly appropriate - this is a rallid of swampy areas, and its habits and behaviour – indeed its entire lifestyle – are a reflection of this fact. Like the colloquial name ‘bush chicken’ for the francolin, ‘swamphen’ epitomises the very essence of this species.</p><p>Often the first sign of the occurrence of the African Swamphen in dense aquatic vegetation is the presence of rough floating platforms constructed of bent reed or rush stems on which it roosts or stands while feeding. These feeding platforms are usually surrounded by short lengths of plant stems that have been cut by the stout bill to extract the soft pith. It is also often heard calling long before it is seen, and the persistent nasal shrieks and wails emanating from dense Typha sedge beds are typical of the species. The swamphen has been described as a noisy, brash bird, and while ‘noisy’ is apt, it is seldom brash – it is often skulking and secretive, frequently remaining in dense vegetation, making it difficult to see or photograph.</p><p>Often the first sign of the occurrence of the African Swamphen in dense aquatic vegetation is the presence of rough floating platforms constructed of bent reed or rush stems on which it roosts or stands while feeding.

Like many rallids, it flicks its tail frequently, revealing the white, powder-puff undertail coverts; this may signify unease, and is likely to have a display function to other swamphens, warning of danger. The long legs and large feet are conspicuously red, and are remarkably dextrous. The feet are used for grasping sedges while pieces are bitten off with the powerful bill. Although mainly vegetarian, the swamphen also feeds on aquatic invertebrates, frogs and even bird’s eggs and nestlings.</p><p>As a species favouring large, perennial wetlands, the swamphen is patchily distributed throughout our region, and is absent from the dry Kalahari and Karoo. It is not migratory, but undertakes large-scale movements in response to rainfall. During wet years, over 5,000 nesting pairs have been estimated at Nylsvley in South Africa; conversely, during drought years almost none are recorded. When conditions are right, Nylsvley must be one of the best places to see it!</p><p>The breeding biology of this species is quite well-known. It is a facultative, co-operative breeder, with the breeding pair often – but not always – assisted in nest construction, incubation and chick rearing by helpers. In this respect, it is not unique among rallids, since several other southern African species share this strategy. A platform nest is constructed in reeds over water, and since incubation only commences when the clutch of two to five eggs is complete, the young hatch synchronously. This is important as the young are both precocial and nidifugous, and flee the nest soon after hatching. Their down traps air, making them buoyant, and they are good swimmers despite lacking webbed toes. The chicks dive readily when danger threatens, and they may remain submerged with only the bill and nostrils protruding until ‘the coast is clear’. They are very much at home in their wetland environment.</p><p>The future of the swamphen is inextricably tied to that of its wetland habitat, and if our wetlands are well cared for, the swamphen will take care of itself.</p>",

North of South Africa it is widespread in Zimbabwe and west into northern Botswana and Namibia.

For instance, birds from Zambia move south as far as northern Botswana and Namibia. Zimbabwean birds seem to be both sedentary and nomadic but there is a winter influx which has been suggested comes from South Africa where the numbers fall at that time.

For example, a female ringed as an adult in January was caught on its nest in the same, short-grass vlei 21 years 7 months later, making it at least 24 years old. It is the non-breeding birds that form varying sized parties and which roam widely during their formative years. Outside the breeding season they may be joined by adults whose habitat has become flooded by heavy summer rains. Some birds, mainly females, breed at two years of age but normally they start at three years with some males even later. Breeding habitat may be a limiting factor because they require a large territory, nests being placed at about kilometre intervals in extensive wet areas. If the vlei is small and there is a body of water such as a dam, several pairs may breed in close proximity to one another, with the apparently dominant pair holding the territory closest to the open water. At one study site only the two pairs that bred closest to the dam successfully reared young. Possibly the other birds were excluded from the choice feeding grounds and the young perished.</p><p>The birds are very active in the defence of their young and nest, and will display, with wings outspread and calling loudly, right up to the face of an approaching cow. These birds breed in cooler areas than the White-crowned Lapwing and, in extremely hot weather, incubating parents change over at the nest more frequently, and also wet their belly feathers to cool the eggs.</p>",

It also occurs widely in coastal and lowland forests along the eastern littoral and extends westwards along the ribbons of riparian forest that fringe many of the larger savanna rivers, rivers such as the Limpopo, Zambezi and Okavango. In places it extends into mature deciduous woodland, into timber plantations, and even into well-wooded suburban gardens.</p><p>Because of its distinctive call it is a bird that is familiar, at least by voice, to most people who live in these areas. The birds are masters at concealment during the day, hiding in thick foliage, often among entwined creepers and high up in a tree, but after sunset their exuberant hooting reveals their presence. One bird starts, usually the male, then its mate; a pause for a few moments and the calling is repeated.

Established adult birds such as these are probably sedentary and remain life-long with their partners in their territories, roosting in it during the day, hunting in it at night and rearing their young in it each breeding season. Not a great deal is known about the hunting methods of these owls beyond that they watch the ground from a vantage point and pounce on any prey that comes within range. More is known about the prey brought to feed nestlings, and here it has been shown that a wide range of insects, rodents, centipedes, small snakes, frogs and small birds are regularly taken.</p><p>In common with other owls, African Wood Owls do not construct a nest but instead they breed in a cavity in a large tree trunk. Many of the holes used are only a few metres above the ground, but some can be much higher. There are records of the birds using nesting boxes, old bird of prey stick nests and even of their laying on the ground. These, though, are exceptional. Ideal sites are often used repeatedly in successive years. Breeding is initiated during early summer, and the clutch of two eggs is laid mainly between August and October. Incubation, by the female, lasts 31 days and during this time she is fed by the male. The whole breeding cycle, from start to finish, lasts a little over two months, and the fledged young remain with their parents for a further three weeks before gradually gaining their independence, and dispersing.&#9;</p>",

However, ongoing genetic studies suggest that this vast range probably hides at least one cryptic species, with birds from the south of the range more closely related to Cape White-eyes than other ‘Yellow’ White-eyes from farther north in Africa.</p><p>Being a tropical species the Yellow White-eye is slightly smaller than its southern relatives, but not visibly so. In terms of general behaviour and breeding habits, however, the species are essentially similar. The social unit is the pair, and at the start of every day each pair leaves their roost and joins other pairs to form a group. The group may join a mixed foraging flock of other insectivorous birds and move through the tree tops with it, or several white-eye groups may aggregate into a flock which, in the winter dry season, may muster a hundred or more birds. Even in such flocks, however, paired birds usually stay close together, and during rest periods they perch together and often preen each other. At dusk, the groups break up into pairs, each couple seeking their own roost where they spend the night nestled against each other, heads under wings, looking like a feathery ball with two tails.</p><p>Being a tropical species the Yellow White-eye is slightly smaller than its southern relatives, but not visibly so.

If a cat or snake is spotted, they gather round at a safe distance, giving querulous alarm calls which quickly attract bulbuls, prinias and sunbirds to form a vociferous mobbing party. In spring and summer, when they breed, they become even more wary, giving warning calls at the approach of potential nest robbers such as shrikes or coucals. Yellow White-eyes are regular visitors to the birdbath to drink, but more particularly to enjoy several good bathing sessions, interspersed with bouts of vigorous preening. If no standing water is available, white-eyes bathe in dew-soaked foliage.</p><p>The Yellow White-eyes’ nest is much like other white-eye nests – an open cup the size of a tennis ball cut in half, sited on a vertical or horizontally forked twig, and fashioned from dry grass blades, tendrils and fine twigs, all bound together and reinforced with spider web. The clutch of three eggs can be white, blue or pale green, and they are incubated by both male and female, though mostly by the female.  The young are fed by both parents, and the nestling period is 14-15 days. What sets this white-eye apart is that it is the only confirmed host in southern Africa of the Green-backed Honeybird. At one site in Zimbabwe some 27% of Yellow White-eye nests had eggs inserted by this brood parasite.</p>",

Indeed, those of us who’ve had the thrill of watching flying Alpine Swifts at close quarters, swooping falcon-like past their colony, can only marvel at their effortless mastery of the air; birds in Europe have been estimated to cover up to 1&#160;000 km in the course of  a day’s foraging. It has been well studied there, where it often nests on buildings, but where the relatively short summer permits them to breed only once before migrating to northern Africa. Nesting on buildings and other man-made structures is uncommon in South Africa, but they’ve decided that the 25-storey provincial government building in Bloemfontein, with its granite chip coating, is a suitable substitute for a cliff, and here the nests are reasonably accessible.</p><p>They breed colonially and the nests, despite being simple open bowls, are sometimes very close together and the owners within touching distance. They have a much longer breeding season here, usually producing two clutches, occasionally even three, but of only one or two eggs compared to one to four (mostly three) in Europe, where the higher summer rainfall probably supports a greater density of insects. In what may be another adaptation to a lower, less predictable food supply in Bloemfontein during the nestling period, incubation begins after the first egg is laid so that in a two-egg clutch, hatching is asynchronous, usually a day or two apart, and the first-hatched chick has a significant advantage over its younger sibling when an adult arrives with a food ball in its throat. When the food supply is limited the older nestling is able to monopolise it; the consequent disparity in chick size can result in the death of the stunted sibling, which usually ends up as a flattened corpse in the bottom of the nest. Such episodes are difficult to monitor objectively, but this does mean that at least one chick survives under these conditions. (In Europe, hatching is synchronous, usually within 24 hours.)</p><p>They breed colonially and the nests, despite being simple open bowls, are sometimes very close together and the owners within touching distance.

They’ve been described as ‘voracious feeders’ on honeybees, and in a book on bee-keeping in South Africa this is mentioned in the chapter on diseases and pests of honeybees; however, they do eat a wide variety of arthropods, mainly insects, but also spiders, all taken aerially. It is unlikely that these, or other swifts, are able to rid bees of their stings in flight, so the birds are presumably immune to bee venom.</p><p>Nests are reused by pairs in successive seasons, and the oldest bird so far recorded at this colony was 17 years when last recaptured, quite impressive for a bird weighing less than 100&#160;g, though somewhat less than the 26 years recorded for a ringed European bird. Incubation and brood-rearing are shared by the parents; when incubating eggs or brooding small young, some adults sit very tight and may attack one’s hand, making examination of the nest contents difficult, especially if one is clinging onto the side of a building with the other hand! Contrary to the claim of some authors, that it is just a breeding visitor to South Africa, this swift is actually found here all year; however, South African birds do apparently occur in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi on passage (in March-June, and August-October), so it seems to be a partial migrant, possibly to East Africa.&#9;</p>",

The extent of nomadic movement is not known; the longest movements recorded to date are up to 120 kilometres, these apparently made by young birds during post-breeding dispersal. Ringing studies have shown that the birds which return to their natal areas in Zimbabwe in subsequent seasons are mainly females. In an Eastern Cape study the females tended to be less restricted, while many more males returned to the same territory in a subsequent season, although one female did return annually over a ten-year period. There is generally a poor return rate of ringed birds to any non-breeding ringing station, indicating the restless and nomadic nature of these birds. There has been a gradual westward extension of range along the Western Cape littoral in recent decades.</p><p>In Zimbabwe this is essentially a bird of miombowoodlands and where these have been seriously fragmented the Scarlet-chested Sunbird has taken their place to a large degree. In South Africa it inhabits a variety of predominantly broad-leafed woodlands and has adapted widely to an urban environment with its mixture of indigenous and exotic vegetation. The species is normally fairly thinly distributed but during the non-breeding months will concentrate in some numbers at good nectar sources. In my Bathurst study area the Cape Honey&#173;suckle Tecoma capensis and Wild Dagga Leonotis leonura were favoured over aloes and the Karoo Boer-bean Schotia afra,while in Zimbabwe, apart from the honeysuckle and Wild Dagga, these birds also concentrated on various flowering mistletoes. Despite good stands of nectar-bearing plants, numbers at any one site may vary considerably from day to day and even during the course of a day. Presence at nectar sources tends to occur when the day warms up, with hawking for insects taking place more frequently in the early morning and evening.</p>",

While there is evidence that individual Amur Falcons return to the same communal roosts each year, there also seems to be quite a lot of movement between roosts over the southern summer. Most of the bigger roosts are located in planted stands of alien trees close to or within built-up areas – mainly small rural settlements, but including major centres like Maseru (Lesotho), Bloemfontein (South Africa) and Harare (Zimbabwe). During the day the communal flocks break up into singletons or small groups and spread out over a wide area to forage almost exclusively on invertebrates, from ground-dwelling beetles and sunspiders, to airborne locusts and termite alates.</p><p>The migration biology of this bird, which includes a biannual movement of the entire global population along a relatively narrow flyway, stretched almost fully across two massive and heavily populated continents, renders it vulnerable to a myriad of threats to its continued existence. As a cutting example of this exposure, it was recently revealed that Indian tribespeople in the remote state of Nagaland catch and trade in, or kill and eat, tens if not hundreds of thousands of Amurs every year as the birds move through north-eastern India on migration. How the species has sustained this level of carnage for any length of time remains a mystery, but with the additional pressures of habitat loss and degradation, chemical pollution and climate change, the Amur Falcon may well be skating on very thin ice indeed.</p>",

There is only one specimen record of its occurrence, a bird collected at Okahandja in May, 1940. There are sight records from the Nhabe and Chobe Rivers in northern Botswana, at Rundu Sewage Works and on the Kunene River near Ruacana in northern Namibia. However, the lack of photographic records raises questions about the validity of at least some of these records, given the widespread use of digital cameras by birders in recent years. Elsewhere, it occurs in two populations, a lowland population along the coast from Gabon to central Angola, and a highland population from Uganda and western Kenya to Tanzania, northern Zambia and northern Malawi. Angola Swallows recorded on the central plateau in Angola are probably from this highland population.</p><p>The habitat of the Angola Swallow is grassland, montane grassland, swamp and forest edges, rivers, villages and cultivated fields. My experience of the species is seeing it along the Kwanza River in Malange, in rather open miombo woodland. Seven nests were found in an open cave-like shelter under large boulders at the Kwanza River rapids south-west of Kangandala. Only two nests, with four eggs and three nestlings, respectively, could be reached and examined.

There are only four records from southern Africa, two from the Western Cape and two from the Eastern Cape, all between May and September.

It is also larger than a Pintado Petrel, with longer, more pointed wings. It is strongly attracted to vessels at sea, but seldom follows for long. It feeds mainly by surface-seizing or from shallow dives. The vast majority of the population breeds inland on Antarctica, at small ‘nunataks’ of exposed rock that peek up through the vast ice sheet that cloaks the continent. More than 30 colonies are known, but counts at sea suggest that more colonies await discovery. It is not globally threatened.</p>",

Six species are recognised worldwide, of which five occur off southern Africa. These small petrels all have similar plumage patterns and differ mainly in the sizes and shapes of their bills. The three species in the Broad-billed Prion complex are especially problematic, forming a continuum in size from the large Broad-billed Prion, through Salvin’s Prion, to the smaller Antarctic Prion. Where the two extremes overlap in the South Atlantic and New Zealand region, they are fairly easy to tell apart, given a good view, but throughout much of the southern Indian Ocean where Salvin’s Prions occur, there is an element of guesswork in many identifications.</p><p>By far the commonest species in southern Africa is the Antarctic Prion, and for local birders it is the standard against which all other prions should be judged. The status of most of the other species is rather poorly known, because until recently we relied mainly on beached birds to assess which species visited the region. Now, the advent of digital cameras and auto-focus lenses has revolutionised our ability to identify prions at sea, and we are slowly learning more about the abundance and distribution of the less common species.</p><p>By far the commonest species in southern Africa is the Antarctic Prion, and for local birders it is the standard against which all other prions should be judged.

Now, the advent of digital cameras and auto-focus lenses has revolutionised our ability to identify prions at sea, and we are slowly learning more about the abundance and distribution of the less common species.</p><p>Antarctic Prions are common at the shelf break off the Cape during a relatively short period from the end of May to August, when smaller numbers also range farther north into Namibia and, more rarely, KwaZulu-Natal and even southern Mozambique: a few stragglers remain into September or October. They are rare over the continental shelf, only coming close to land when there are strong onshore winds. Despite their strongly seasonal presence in coastal waters, they are present year-round in oceanic waters south and west of southern Africa.</p><p>Antarctic Prions typically occur in groups, which can number tens of thousands when they first arrive in the region or are preparing to depart. They use a diversity of foraging techniques to capture their prey of small crustaceans, fish and squid, including surface-seizing, surface-plunging, shallow dives and hydroplaning, when they plough their bill through the water with raised wings. The sides of the bill have filtering lamellae designed to strain small prey items from the water. Much foraging is assumed to take place at night, when zooplankton and mid-water fish migrate vertically too close to the sea surface, but in southern Africa they also forage extensively by day, especially behind fishing vessels where they probably target small scraps and discards. They aggregate at oceanic fronts where prey availability is greatest, and their distribution off the west coast of South Africa is associated with warmer sea surface temperatures, probably because cold, recently up-welled water contains relatively little zooplankton.</p><p>Like most small petrels, prions usually breed in burrows, but they also make use of natural crevices and even caves. Pre-breeders in particular seem to gather in caves to socialise, and it is strange to hear their guttural, pigeon-like cooing calls emanating from deep grottos by day and night. Climbing into such caves, and sitting among the prions, is an unforgettable experience. Prions arrive and depart from their colonies mainly by night, when the risk of predation by Subantarctic Skuas is least. Despite this, they are a favoured prey of skuas, which kill large numbers at breeding colonies each year. Fortunately, the global population of Antarctic Prions is huge, perhaps of the order of 50 million birds, with the largest breeding population on South Georgia, and substantial numbers at numerous other sub-Antarctic and Antarctic islands. The species is not listed as threatened.</p>",

Small numbers may come from more southerly Antarctic islands, where the greatest numbers breed, but proof of this is still lacking.</p><p>South Africa plays host to the only truly migratory populations: birds start to arrive here in April and have left by October, reaching peak numbers between June and September.

The most easterly is in Algoa Bay with most birds on Bird Island and small numbers at Cape Recife. These are mainly birds from the Indian Ocean, but do include some Atlantic birds. Moving west, the next concentration is at Dyer Island, near Gansbaai, where the majority are from the Atlantic – these birds can also be seen at nearby Danger Point. The most westerly birds, of both Atlantic and Indian Ocean origin, can be found ashore during the day at Mauritz Bay and Cape Columbine, near Saldanha, with smaller aggregations in the West Coast National Park and on Dassen and Malgas Islands. All of the three subpopulations contain birds whose moult is out of synchrony with those of known origins: some have even attained full breeding plumage by midwinter. Where these birds come from remains a mystery.</p><p>The West Coast birds appear to be nocturnal feeders, roosting ashore during the day. By contrast, south coast birds feed mostly during the day, returning to their roost sites well after dark. Birds that come ashore at Cape Recife during the day roost at night on Bird Island, 65 kilometres away.</p><p>Non-breeding adults are very variable in colour, with many retaining much of the grey underparts of the breeding plumage. Others have a mottled grey-and-white appearance and yet others are almost wholly white below. Bill colour is also variable: bills of Atlantic birds remain coral-red throughout the winter, while those of the Indian Ocean birds are variably black and dark red.</p><p>Juveniles are totally different in appearance to adults and often cause identification confusion, being heavily mottled brown.

This is a very striking plumage feature which immediately identifies this species.</p><p>Ant-eating Chats are conspicuous in the areas where they occur because they spend a great deal of their time sitting on the top of the tallest bush, pole or termite mound in the area. They seem to leap into the air from a perch and fly with fluttering wings to the ground or the next perch. They are usually seen in pairs or small groups of five to six birds.</p><p>Although the birds will often drop down from a perch to catch prey, it would appear that much, if not most of the foraging, is done on the ground, the birds either running or hopping a short distance, then stopping and looking around for prey. As their name implies, ants form an important part of their diet, as do harvester termites which are active on the surface of the ground during the day. However, the birds are also known to eat beetles and particularly the spider-like solifuges. If one breaks open a termite mound when the birds are nearby they do not hesitate to feed on the termites thus exposed.</p><p>Although their song is quiet, it is very varied and consists of both whistles and rasping calls. The call which is most likely to be heard, however, is a whistled ‘peeeek’. It is used for contact between the birds and also as an alarm call.</p><p>Although Ant-eating Chats may breed at any time during the summer, it is noticeable that it is most likely to breed following good rains when insect food is most available. At such times the male may be seen flying over his territory with his wings held rather stiffly in such a way that the white windows are particularly prominent, at the same time giving his whistling song. These chats are unusual in that they always nest in a hole dug into the roof of an aardvark burrow if there is one available. In the absence of aardvark burrows, the birds will dig a nest tunnel into a vertical sandy bank in a gully or stream. The tunnel is about a metre long, and at the end of it is a rather large chamber where a cup-shaped nest is made from grass blades and rootlets. Only the female is responsible for incubation of the eggs, which usually number three or four, though up to seven have been recorded. Both male and female feed the nestlings, assisted at some nests by ‘helpers’, which are young birds from earlier broods. When the chicks are nearly fledged they come to the tunnel entrance to be fed.&#9;</p>",

They have a bright orange-coloured eye, but the feature which really distinguishes this species, except where they overlap with other babbler species, is their very loud babbling calls. These calls are given by a whole flock in unison. One bird starts the chorus and the others join in, with the noise gradually rising to a crescendo and then dying away. When two groups of babblers meet along the boundary between their territories, both groups call louder and louder as each group tries to drown out the other. Eventually one or other group decides that it has had enough and stops calling, moving back into its territory.</p><p>The babblers usually are found in groups of three to eight birds, but groups of up to fifteen have been recorded. They remain in groups that are strongly territorial year-round. Territory size varies considerably depending on the habitat quality. The birds forage on the ground for a variety of foods, including insects and other invertebrates such as grasshoppers, beetles, moths, caterpillars, termites, ants and spiders.

They also eat fruit found on the ground and nectar from Schotia and aloe flowers.</p><p>The babbler’s nest is built in dense vegetation, such as a creeper, bush, or a thick tree, especially if the tree is thorny. In our garden at Marondera the birds invariably nested in creepers which provided a thick, safe habitat along the fence. In another garden nearby they nested regularly inside the middle of pampas grass clumps. The nest is a large mass of dry grass and twigs with a deep cup in the middle, lined with fine rootlets or leaf petioles.</p><p>The first eggs are usually laid in August, with the chicks fledging by the end of September when they accompany the adults around the garden. It is noteworthy that the babbler group never leave the nest unguarded; when the group comes to feed the chicks, the bird guarding the nest moves off, allowing the rest of the group to feed the chicks one by one. The last bird to do so settles onto the small chicks to brood them but if they are bigger and well feathered, the last bird climbs up above the nest in the tree to keep watch. Whenever I approached the nest, the ‘guard’ would immediately start babbling at the top of its voice, and the rest of the group would arrive to shout loudly at me as I drew nearer to the nest.</p><p>By starting to nest in very early spring in Zimbabwe, they are able to fledge one brood of chicks before the Levaillant’s Cuckoos return. The groups in our garden invariably built a second nest in October, and it was these nests that were often parasitised by the Levaillant’s Cuckoo. The building of a nest involved the birds carrying a lot of sticks, twigs and finer material to build the large bulky nest. This activity clearly was noticed by the cuckoos, which probably laid an egg in the nest after the babblers had laid one or two of the eggs in the clutch. Sometimes a babbler nest contained two cuckoo eggs. The cuckoo’s eggs are very similar to those of the babbler, just slightly larger, and the cuckoo’s eggs usually hatched before the babbler’s eggs, giving the cuckoo chick a head start. Almost inevitably the larger cuckoo chick took the lion’s share of the food thus starving the babbler chicks. However, on two occasions when there was a lot of food available because of early rain, the babblers managed to rear both a cuckoo chick and one of their own chicks.</p>",

Its song/call is not easily transcribed (different reference works give different renderings of it), but it has a descending warble ‘sszzit-sszzit-sreee-sreee’, and a hissing alarm call.</p><p>The Ashy Flycatcher is largely a forest-fringe bird, usually avoiding the interior of larger stands of evergreen forest. It does much of its foraging on the wing, so it prefers open spaces in which to hunt, like other members of its genus such as the Dusky Flycatcher. Nevertheless, it shows more affinity for evergreen forest than for woodland. Where it does frequent woodland (such as Miombo) it is usually found in the denser stands or in the evergreen growth lining streams or rivers.</p><p>The Ashy Flycatcher is largely a forest-fringe bird, usually avoiding the interior of larger stands of evergreen forest.

Where it does frequent woodland (such as Miombo) it is usually found in the denser stands or in the evergreen growth lining streams or rivers.</p><p>Ashy Flycatchers are commonly encountered as solitary birds, though it is probable that a single bird has an unseen mate, and they are thought to be sedentary in most areas. An individual usually gives a single wing flick when returning to perch after a hawking sally. In addition to taking prey on the wing, it also targets prey on the ground. It is said that this species does not glean foliage, but I have seen Ashy Flycatchers pluck invertebrate prey from leaves while in hovering flight. Although their main diet is insects, they also eat very small geckos, and they occasionally supplement their insect fare with small berries, as do many other insectivorous birds. Fruits are eaten by choice rather than necessity, because insect prey is always available for African forest- and woodland-dwelling birds.</p><p>In winter, singletons or pairs regularly join mixed-species foraging flocks in riverine forest strips or forest-woodland mosaics. Birders who have yet to add this bird to their life list may well find it in dry-season bird parties in the right sort of habitat.</p><p>A breeding pair defends a territory of from one to four hectares in extent, while the home range (the undefended area over which a resident pair ranges in its daily sorties) may be as much as 20 hectares. Although the Ashy Flycatcher is usually classified as a resident species, there is evidence of seasonal movement, some of it altitudinal (in regions with steep altitudinal gradients, as in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Mpumalanga), and some perhaps due to dispersal of young birds after the breeding season. It is likely that mated pairs are resident and stay within their home range throughout the year, while the young birds and adults without partners (known as ‘floaters’) move around looking for vacant habitat and mates.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Another of our ‘grey’ tits, the Ashy Tit is near-endemic to southern Africa. Its range broadly follows that of semi-arid acacia savannas from about Benguela, Angola, south through Namibia and Botswana to the Northern Cape Province, western Limpopo Province and Free State. They also occur locally in central Zimbabwe, where they overlap with the more widespread and abundant Miombo Tit. Ashy Tits occur in mesic and arid acacia savannas and woodlands, including dry woodlands along seasonal rivers. Ashy Tits are absent from broad-leaved woodland, where their ecological niche is filled by the Miombo Tit. There is some overlap in range between the two species, and it is suggested that this is relatively new, and has been facilitated by the removal of miombo woodland and its replacement by fine-leaved woodland. Both Ashy Tits and Miombo Tits can occur in the same mixed-species bird party where the group is foraging along the ecotone between miombo and fine-leaved woodland.</p><p>Ashy Tits are locally common residents, but may be locally nomadic (i.e. nomadic at a landscape scale, rather than a regional scale). The birds appear to tolerate some transformation of their habitat, and they occur in gardens, provided there are Acacia trees. Their density in acacia woodland in Limpopo Province is about one pair per 50 ha, in mixed woodland in the Kalahari about one pair per 12 ha, and in mixed woodland on rocky areas in Botswana, about one pair per 106 ha. Ashy Tits associate with Long-billed Crombecs, Black-chested Prinias, Rufous-eared Warblers and Cape Penduline-Tits in mixed-species foraging flocks. Like the Grey and Southern Black Tit, Ashy Tits hammer at pods to extract larvae of seed parasites, and hold large prey items down with a foot to peck off bite-sized chunks. A wide range of food items are eaten, including lepidopteran larvae, beetles, ants, spiders, flies, fruits and seeds.</p><p>Ashy Tits are locally common residents, but may be locally nomadic (i.e. nomadic at a landscape scale, rather than a regional scale).

The birds are territorial when nesting, and the male sings throughout the incubation period and at least to early nestling stage from the top of a tall tree. The nest is a pad of hair and soft plant fibres, placed in a cavity such as an old barbet or woodpecker nest, or a natural hole in a tree, or in a vertical or horizontal steel pipe. Hair used in nests near Kimberley was apparently collected entirely from regurgitated pellets below a White-backed Vulture roost. If a previously used nest is occupied again, the old nest material is sometimes incorporated into the new nest.</p><p>Clutches of up to six eggs have been recorded, but usually four eggs are laid. Incubation is by the female only, fed by the male, who approaches the nest hole with food, calling softly, with rapidly quivering wings. The female emerges to accept the food, also quivering her wings. She may then return to incubate, or follow the male on a brief foraging excursion. Incubating females show interesting distraction behaviour: if the nest is threatened or inspected closely, the female mimics a striking snake, by hissing loudly, swaying and striking at the intruder, at the same time rapidly opening her wings to hit the sides of the nest chamber, making a drumming sound. The nestlings are brooded by the female for about the first week, during which time the male passes food to her at, or just outside, the nest hole. Thereafter the nestlings are fed by both parents equally, usually on caterpillars. Breeding success is low in general, with a particularly high failure rate of nests in steel-pipe fence posts in Kimberley, possibly due to high temperatures.</p>",

The two species were only split fairly recently, and the morphological differences between them are subtle. Indeed, the juveniles are so similar that they are hard to tell apart in the field. However, the two species differ markedly in breeding behaviour: Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses breed singly or in loose colonies on relatively flat ground, whereas Indian Yellow-nosed Albatrosses breed in dense colonies on steep slopes and cliffs.</p><p>Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses are confined as breeders to the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island in the central South Atlantic, where they are the only mollymawk. Although some non-breeders wander into the south-west Indian Ocean, occasionally reaching as far east as Australasia, they are mostly found in the Atlantic Ocean, where they range widely in temperate waters. A few even straggle across the Equator, and they are the albatross species recorded most frequently in the North Atlantic. Chicks ringed in the 1930s were all recovered off Namibia and southern Angola, but since the 1980s, more than half of all juveniles have been recovered from Brazil. Among adults, roughly half disperse east and half west from the breeding islands.</p><p>Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses are confined as breeders to the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island in the central South Atlantic, where they are the only mollymawk.

They are usually the most abundant albatross off Namibia, but play second fiddle to the larger Shy and Black-browed Albatrosses off the Cape, especially when scavenging at fishing vessels. If they attempt to eat large items, they are usually displaced by other, larger albatrosses, so they use their greater aerial agility to drop down and grab small food items. In addition to scavenging at fishing vessels, they also catch a wide range of fish. They often forage with Cory’s Shearwaters, targeting pelagic fish chased from below by other predators such as dolphins or tunas. The albatrosses plunge down onto their prey or even take Saury (see glossary) and flying fish in the air.</p><p>A small breeding colony on Gough Island has been studied intensively since the early 1980s. Most birds breed annually, retaining the same partner in successive years. However, divorces do occur, both temporary and permanent. Sometimes a male takes a new mate for one season then sits in the embarrassing position of having both its old and new partners return the following year. In such circumstances, both females may lay in the same nest, which almost invariably leads to breeding failure as neither egg gets incubated properly.</p><p>Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses are listed as Endangered due to ongoing population decreases. Eggs, chicks and some adults used to be harvested for food at the Tristan group, and some were killed at sea for food off southern Africa. Fortunately these practices have now largely ceased, and the species is protected at its breeding islands. The main threat currently is accidental mortality on fishing gear. Few are killed by tuna longlines off southern Africa, but they are commonly killed by a suite of longline fisheries off the east coast of South America.</p>",

In these areas they favour areas with rocky outcrops, especially woodland and other natural vegetation between the huge, rounded, whale-backed rocks called dwalas which abound throughout much of central and eastern Zimbabwe. Originally they were thought to be a subspecies of the Jackal Buzzard.</p><p>This medium-sized buzzard is black or very dark grey on the back, and completely white from the chin to the tail, with white underwings that have a dark trailing edge to the flight feathers. Like Jackal Buzzards, they have a conspicuously rufous tail which is visible from above or below, but they are easily distinguished by their white underparts. Some Jackal Buzzards have a white breast, especially in the Northern Cape and southern Namibia, but they always differ in flight by having dark (not white) underwing coverts. Augur Buzzards have a loud‘kow-kow-kow’ call which sounds something like the call of the Side-striped Jackal.</p><p>This medium-sized buzzard is black or very dark grey on the back, and completely white from the chin to the tail, with white underwings that have a dark trailing edge to the flight feathers.

Augur Buzzards have a loud‘kow-kow-kow’ call which sounds something like the call of the Side-striped Jackal.</p><p>Augur Buzzards use two conspicuous methods of hunting their prey. The first hunting method is to still-hunt. The birds sit on a conspicuous perch from which they can observe a fairly large open area for movement by rodents, shrews and lizards. Because their white underparts contrast with their dark backs, the birds are conspicuous and in fact make no effort to conceal themselves while perched. The fact that other birds do not mob them suggests that birds are not a major part of their diet in this part of their range. If smaller birds, such as the drongos and bulbuls, recognised the Augur Buzzard as a predator they would certainly fly out and mob the buzzard. In fact insects, reptiles and small mammals form the bulk of their food, with birds being unimportant.</p><p>The second hunting method is similar to the hovering of the Jackal Buzzard in that the Augur Buzzard hangs in updraughts on the sides of hills, often moving its wings slightly to give it better stability. This allows the bird to keep its head almost still and watch for movement on the ground below. When prey is spotted, the bird drops down with wings folded back and grasps the prey with its talons. I watched an Augur Buzzard pick up a shrew from the side of the road using this method.</p><p>Augur Buzzards usually nest on a cliff ledge, but do sometimes utilise trees in between the dwalas. The nests are quite large, being relatively large for the size of the bird, which suggests that they are used year after year, and merely added to and refurbished in each succeeding season. When the birds start rebuilding the nest they also start displaying overhead with some spectacular aerobatics in which the birds climb rapidly upwards, often spiralling up on an updraught and then plummeting down in a steep dive accompanied by considerable noise created by their passage through the air, like a miniature jet fighter. They also call loudly at the same time. Two birds have been recorded as grasping talons and cartwheeling in the sky, but this might be the antics of rival males rather than a mated pair. Once the two eggs have been laid the noise and displays abate, and the area becomes much quieter. If both eggs should hatch, the older chick invariably kills the younger chick within the first week. Green leaves are brought to the nest throughout the incubation and nestling period.</p>",

It is the smallest of the three locally occurring Hieraaetus eagles, weighing less than one kilogram and having a wingspan of just over a metre.</p><p>Much of what is known about Ayres’ Eagles is based on 30 years of meticulous observation of these birds in Kenya by the late Leslie Brown, doyen of researchers of African eagles. He documented the nesting cycle in detail and monitored the changing fortunes of the individual birds that replaced each other over the years at the same nest. What emerges is that these eagles pair for life and reuse the same nest, or a nearby alternative, year after year, and when one of the pair dies, the surviving mate finds a new partner to continue the site occupation.</p><p>Much of what is known about Ayres’ Eagles is based on 30 years of meticulous observation of these birds in Kenya by the late Leslie Brown, doyen of researchers of African eagles.

Nest repair can take four to five weeks before the single-egg clutch is laid in April or May and the birds call frequently during this period, uttering a high-pitched whistling ‘hip-hip-hip-hueep-hueep…’, both while soaring over their territory or when greeting each other at the nest. The incubation is undertaken entirely by the female, and she is brought prey at intervals by the male who delivers it and quickly departs, staying away for much of the time, and roosting at night out of sight of the nest. The duration of the nesting cycle is much like that of the Wahlberg’s Eagle, with a 45-day incubation period and a 73-day nestling period so that by September the chick, if it survives, is on the wing.</p><p>Throughout the incubation and nestling periods there is a steady addition of leafy branches to the nest lining. Both sexes do this, the female perhaps to relieve the boredom of sitting, leaving the nest from time to time to collect a leafy twig, and the male sometimes arriving with a spray of leaves instead of prey. The function of this behaviour, which is performed by most eagles and several other birds of prey, has been much speculated on and the likely explanation, apart from making the nest more comfortable to sit on, is that the green leaves provide a form of insect and parasite repellent.</p><p>The timing of fledging more or less coincides with the arrival of Ayres’ Eagles reported in some of the cities in southern Africa, in particular Bulawayo, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Nelspruit and Barberton, and this strongly suggests that these eagles are seasonal migrants that move south after nesting, and that they spend September to March here, attracted to towns and cities like these by the good supply of doves and especially feral pigeons that are present. Leslie Brown described this bird as “an extremely dashing, swift little eagle with magnificent flying powers, combining the speed of a large falcon with the agility of a goshawk”, and observers who have watched the birds killing the cities’ pigeons fully concur. When hunting pigeons they climb to a great height then launch into a breath-taking dive, folding in the wings close to the body, canting as they descend, and even inverting before banking up and snatching their victim in flight from an unsuspecting flock. It is rather odd that one’s chances of seeing this rare, elusive little eagle is greater in an urban jungle like Pretoria or Nelspruit than it is in its more natural surroundings.</p>",

It likes areas covered in tall, robust growth but also occurs in areas with shorter, sparser cover, even moving out onto floating vegetation to feed like a jacana. They often breed in areas that are temporarily flooded and not particularly densely vegetated. In such locations, it’s then a matter of choosing places which promise to provide plenty of food for the youngsters four to eight weeks down the line, and which do not harbour too many predators. Even so, the birds may not always make the right choice. One year, one of the pans along the Save River in Zimbabwe’s south-eastern lowveld had at least eight occupied nests. However, water levels fell very quickly, and two weeks later every nest had been deserted or depredated and the birds had all moved away.</p><p>One of the features of the entire crake family is their ability to reach and colonise remote oceanic islands. In terms of turning up far from the mainland, Baillon’s Crake is no exception. It has been recorded on the Chatham Islands some 800 km west of New Zealand’s South Island, and even further away on Macquarie Island, 1&#160;000 km south of South Island where penguins live. Yet none of these birds look to be built for flight, and they include more flightless forms than any other avian family. Over a third of the total number of rails, crakes, moorhens and coots are species restricted to islands.  But 57% (31) of those island forms are flightless or virtually so. They seem particularly prone to dispense with the power of flight. That capacity to get to remote places must flow from the need of many species to undertake long journeys of dispersal – as much as migration – to find suitable new wetland homes. But once there, and if there is a permanent source of surface water, they can make do with very restricted living territories. The absence of predators and year-round damp conditions which exclude fire, mean that they don’t need to fly off anywhere else. Loss of flight often leads to increase in size as in the South American Giant Coots. Although their young can fly and do disperse soon after gaining that strength, once they arrive at an acceptable new home, they lose that power and continue to fill out and grow until they are too heavy to fly.</p>",

It has a very disjunct distribution and presently three discrete races are recognised. Nominate cincta is found from the South African highveld west and north into eastern Botswana and southern Zimbabwe, with a subpopulation centred in the Western Cape, extending marginally into the coastal Eastern Cape. Furt her north, the darker race suahelica is found on the Zimbabwean Highveld, northwards into Zambia, while the paler race xerica is found from extreme western Zimbabwe through northern Botswana and Namibia into western Zambia and Angola. The nominate race is most easily distinguished from the other races in the field by the contrast between the paler back and darker wings.</p><p>All populations are migratory to some degree, but the actual non-breeding grounds have never been satisfactorily established although they are thought to be in West Africa. The most highly migratory form is the highveld population of cincta which may well winter in the Congo Basin or perhaps in West Africa. The other forms move marginally northwards into Angola and Zambia, some perhaps further, while the southern coastal birds winter in northern KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique, with a few encroaching along the rivers into south-eastern Zimbabwe. Most birds start to arrive in their breeding quarters during September in the north and October in the south, but the birds leaving wintering grounds in Mozambique pass through the Eastern Cape in August, arriving in the Western Cape between late August and September. These southern birds start their departure during late December, with the strongest movement during February and tailing off into early April. The other races depart during March, passing through Zimbabwe from March to May, with a peak in April. A few birds may overwinter in the extreme north of the subregion.</p><p>All populations are migratory to some degree, but the actual non-breeding grounds have never been satisfactorily established although they are thought to be in West Africa.

Here birds often excavate their burrows in the walls or roof of Aardvark burrows, especially in well-grazed areas. During the breeding season this large martin is usually seen in pairs, but groups of two or three pairs may breed in suitable river banks.</p><p>Overall this is not a common bird although larger concentrations, of up to 1&#160;000 birds in Zimbabwe, are occasionally found during northward migration, and numbers may be caught at Barn Swallow roosts on the South African Highveld. Southward migration is much less obvious as birds appear to travel singly or in small parties.</p><p>Generally, this is a conspicuous species that prefers to perch on the tops of small bushes or, nowadays, fences. It will associate with other species of swallows, especially at roost sites, but on migration and in its non-breeding quarters it tends to form single-species flocks. It is one of the species that likes to visit veld fires to catch the disturbed insects. It otherwise feeds over grassland where it hunts low and with a strong, slow flight, usually into the wind.</p>",

Subsequent investigations at St Helena have uncovered the same phenomenon there. Ongoing research is starting to identify some characters that might help to distinguish these species in the field, but for now we have no idea how many species there are within the broader Band-rumped Storm Petrel complex, let alone which of these occurs in southern Africa.

It has a distinctive angled head profile, with a steep forehead and flat-topped crown. Juveniles have turquoise eyes but as they age, a brick-red wash descends from the top of the eye, eventually colouring most of the eye in very old birds. For a few weeks at the start of the breeding season, adults have a white rump patch and white filoplumes on the sides of their heads. And although rare, individuals with some white feathers are more common than in other cormorants.</p><p>Bank Cormorants are exclusively marine and are confined to the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. They breed from Swakopmund, central Namibia, to Quoin Rock, west of Cape Agulhas, and their distribution mirrors that of the giant kelp Ecklonia maxima, although they often feed in areas where kelp is absent. Adults typically remain within 10-20 kilometres of their breeding colonies year-round, but most juveniles disperse considerable distances before selecting a breeding site.</p><p>Bank Cormorants are exclusively marine and are confined to the Benguela upwelling ecosystem.

Adults typically remain within 10-20 kilometres of their breeding colonies year-round, but most juveniles disperse considerable distances before selecting a breeding site.</p><p>They usually breed on large boulders or on other raised sites close to sea. They build their nests almost entirely of seaweed, which the males gather within 100 metres of the nest site. The nest is a large structure, weighing up to 6 kilograms, plastered onto the rock with guano. Building it is a costly, time-consuming effort taking roughly a month, and they are not above stealing material from adjacent nests. Winter storm waves wash over some colonies on isolated rock stacks, and the large, robust nest may be an adaptation to partly withstand such events.</p><p>Most Bank Cormorant colonies contain less than 50 pairs, limited perhaps by the availability of suitable rocks along the coast, but the majority of the population breeds in larger colonies on Ichaboe and Mercury Islands in southern Namibia. They feed on fish and invertebrates caught on the sea floor, diving to deeper depths more regularly than other cormorants in our region. Their dives last on average 45 seconds (occasionally up to 80 seconds), and reach depths of at least 40 metres. Their diet varies considerably between colonies, with fish dominating at some sites, whereas crustaceans or molluscs dominate at other sites. At the two large colonies in Namibia they feed almost entirely on Pelagic Gobies Sufflogobius bibarbatus, which, despite their common name, are mostly caught on the sea bed. Prey is usually swallowed underwater, but larger items are brought to the surface and in the case of rock lobsters, the legs and antennae are shaken off before swallowing. Kelp Gulls often attempt to steal these larger prey items.</p><p>The Bank Cormorant is listed as globally Endangered. The population decreased from some 9 000 pairs in the late 1970s to barely 3 000 pairs in 2001. Much of this decrease occurred at Ichaboe Island, where declines in Pelagic Gobies is thought to have caused the population to crash from 4 100 pairs in 1978 to barely 700 pairs in 2001. The population at Mercury Island fell from 2 000 pairs in 1978 to 600 pairs in 1986 following displacement by Cape Fur Seals. Subsequent removal of fur seals allowed the population to recover close to its original size. In South Africa, several colonies have become extinct and others have decreased greatly in size. Two causes are being investigated: a local shortage of food or excessive temperatures during the breeding season causing birds to abandon their nests. However, it is unclear how either factor could be addressed to reverse this charismatic bird’s ongoing decline.</p>",

The huge numbers found in western Australia come from populations further east in Siberia that travel south along the eastern coastline of Asia.

In non-breeding plumage, these are very drab, greyish-brown birds, but in breeding dress they become rich rufous below, this colour extending from the head and neck to the undertail coverts. By the time the first birds arrive in October, only traces of this breeding dress remain, but by the time they depart in late March and April most adults are well on their way to attaining full breeding plumage. The younger, non-breeding birds do not acquire breeding dress for the first time until they are at least two years old, and some not until they are three or four years old.</p>",

These roosts normally form in reed beds, although where reed beds are absent the swallows may use cane and maize fields, the tops of trees, or even telephone lines. Large roosts may be used for several months, but many of the small roosts are ephemeral, only persisting for a couple of nights.</p><p>Even as far south as South Africa and Botswana some roosts may number a few million birds whose gathering is one of the spectacular sights of an evening sky.

Large roosts may be used for several months, but many of the small roosts are ephemeral, only persisting for a couple of nights.</p><p>A large roost will attract Barn Swallows from a huge area; once estimated in Zambia as at least 20&#160;000 km². As they reach the roosting area they fly around in extensive broad sweeps, attracting newcomers for some time before dropping into the reeds. With every sweep low over the reeds a proportion of the flock lands, until the last arrivals drop in suddenly at dusk. Once in the roost they maintain an intense twittering that can drown out any other noises, including thunder, when one is close by. This noise subsides once it is totally dark. Departure from the roost takes place at first light, and birds leave in series of large flocks.</p><p>The Barn Swallow is extremely gregarious but tends to break up into smaller feeding flocks during the day. Prior to migration, which may take place from mid-February in their southernmost quarters, birds join together in increasingly large flocks and maintain an excited twittering while every now and again they will all take a low diving flight before resettling on their favoured telephone wires or fence lines. The last birds usually leave by April but a few may leave as late as early May, and there are always a few birds overwintering anywhere within the subregion. The fastest known movement was of a bird recovered in Russia 34 days after ringing in South Africa.</p><p>Within Africa the southward movement takes place in a series of waves with a build-up of numbers at various sites en route before they move on to their next stage; in this they sometimes follow the southward movement of rain fronts. Although birds may begin to leave their northern breeding grounds as early as late July the first birds normally only start to trickle in from late September in the north and mid-October in the south, with an avalanche from late October into December. Migration takes place during the day and birds feed as they travel, unlike many species which build up sufficient fat reserves to carry them considerable distances without refuelling. The numbers occurring within an area are usually dependent on rainfall, and in a dry year numbers may be greatly reduced, while in a good wet year numbers are greatly enhanced. Mortality can be very high in drought years as there is insufficient insect prey to satisfy their needs. In rare years the advancing birds may run into adverse weather conditions such as cold, hailstorms or extreme wet, and mortality can be high.</p>",

At this locality the birds are vagrants into broad-leaved Burkea woodland – such movements in the breeding season perhaps indicating the dispersal of juveniles away from their nest areas. Movements, apparently driven by drought conditions, also have been observed. Barred Wren-Warblers are usually seen in pairs, or small groups, possibly family parties, flying from the top of one bush to the bottom of the next, and searching for food inside the bush, seldom foraging on the ground. The diet is poorly known, but appears to be mainly insects, including caterpillars.</p><p>Barred Wren-Warblers are solitary nesters, with territories far apart. The display flight by the male is a vertical climb and downward swoops with purring wings. The nest is a work of art: ball-shaped, with a side-top entrance, usually partly covered by a projecting leaf, and built of felted plant down and fine grass. Nests are stitched into living leaves of broad-leaved herbs, shrubs or small trees with spider web, with the broad leaves almost encasing the nest, and very effectively concealing it from view. One nest found near Polokwane, Limpopo Province, was sewn into the broad leaves of a smallish Buffalo Thorn Ziziphus mucronata tree on the edge of a poorly-drained patch in acacia woodland. This nest would not have been found if the incubating bird had not been seen leaving the nest. The eggs are creamy white to bluish white, finely speckled all over with lilac and purplish brown. There are no records of incubation period, development and care of the nestlings, or breeding success.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Because of its wide distribution, loud calls, and comparatively confiding (even inquisitive) nature, this African warbler is familiar to most birders. It can be found in widely differing habitats and is usually encountered in pairs, and indeed it is unusual to hear the call of a single bird. The male’s rhythmic ‘tlip-tlip-tlip-tlip-tlip’ call is, more often than not, accompanied by the female’s rapid string of ‘pit’ notes. The birds habitually forage in dense vegetation, so they do not usually have each other in sight, and their comparatively loud duets help them to keep in touch. Because of limited visibility in the habitats they favour, it is often difficult for an observer to know whether a single bird is indeed single or whether it has an unseen mate close by. Family groups of four to five (rarely six) birds occur after a brood has fledged.</p><p>The Bar-throated Apalis is well named, and some observers believe that the female can be identified by having a thinner bar marking than the male. The late Dr C&#160;J&#160;Skead investigated this during his 50 years of field observations on the birds of the Eastern Cape. He noted that two birds were usually encountered, that sometimes one of them had a thinner bar than the other, and sometimes both had equally thick bars. One then had to question whether these were male and female, or two males forming a pair, or two males in close proximity at the borders of their respective territories. He also noted that the same bird could reveal a broad band at one moment and a thinner band some minutes later, so movement-determined feather placement could influence the perceived thickness of the bar. Recent study of the species in the Western Cape has revealed, however, that bar width is correlated with territory size and quality, and that there may be consistent sexual differences in the width of the bar.</p><p>The Bar-throated Apalis is well named, and some observers believe that the female can be identified by having a thinner bar marking than the male.

They forage at all levels in vegetation, and occasionally descend to the ground to capture arthropod prey, or to pick up fallen fruit. Having obtained an item on the ground, the bird usually ascends to a perch one metre or more above ground before eating its prize. Fallen fruits have to be small enough for an apalis to swallow, and include, for example, the arillate seeds of the African Peach Kiggelaria africana.</p><p>Judging from its adaptability to a range of different habitat types and its widespread distribution in southern and eastern Africa, the Bar-throated Apalis is evidently a successful species. It is, so far, the only southern African apalis known to be double-brooded. It is a prime host of Klaas’s Cuckoo, especially in the Eastern Cape. In KwaZulu-Natal I once found an adult female Klaas’s Cuckoo in my garden mist net as well as two irate-looking Bar-throated Apalis. Unless a tape recording of its call is played, this apalis is not a common catch in bird ringers’ mist nets, primarily because these birds avoid flying across vegetation gaps when they can get around the gap without leaving cover. To catch two at once with a cuckoo in the same shelf of the mist net left little doubt that they had been chasing the brood parasite.&#9;</p>",

Adult birds are quite unmistakable in their black, white, grey and chestnut plumage, red leggings, and faces that look as if they’ve had an over-application of red lipstick. Their stocky build is distinctive, with an unusually short tail and a broad head that sometimes appears ruff-like, and in flight the bird’s shape and black-and-white colouring is like no other raptor. The bird’s rocking flight is the reason for its name, given to the bird in 1800 by French naturalist François Levaillant: bateleur is a French word for a tightrope walker. Even its scientific name is exotic – ‘marvellous face’ (Terathopius), ‘without tail’ (ecaudatus).</p><p>The Bateleur is a savanna species with a range that extends from Zululand in the south to the southern fringes of the Sahara desert. It is still a familiar sight across much of this range but in the stock-farming savanna areas of South Africa it has all but disappeared as a result of the widespread use of poisoned baits to exterminate jackals and other carnivores. Much of the carnage happened in the first half of the twentieth century, and Bateleurs have never regained a foothold here, those surviving in the country being essentially confined to the largest conservation areas. The contrast between travelling in savannas in South Africa where poisoned baits are used and travelling in, say, the Kruger National Park, where the first Bateleur will come cruising across your path within 15 minutes of arrival, is both striking and saddening.</p><p>The Bateleur is a savanna species with a range that extends from Zululand in the south to the southern fringes of the Sahara desert.

It is estimated that 400-500 pairs are resident, each maintaining a year-round territory 20-35 square kilometres in extent, from which other adults are excluded. Bateleurs secure all their food from within the territory; they nest in it and probably spend virtually all their life within its confines. Locating food is done on the wing, and many hours each day are spent in flight as they course back and forth from one boundary of the territory to the other in this pursuit. Two thirds of what they eat comprises small dead creatures that they encounter, nightjars that were killed on roads during the previous night, for example. The other third consists of any small animal or bird caught napping. Often these are birds such as hornbills, rollers, shrikes or starlings engaged in feeding on the ground, or a basking lizard, unaware of the danger posed by the passing shadow.</p><p>The Bateleur’s flying technique is intriguing. With scarcely a wingbeat it cruises at 50 or 60 kilometres an hour, keeping a straight line, or canting gently to change direction, eventually disappearing from sight only to reappear later from a different direction. It doesn’t often soar like other eagles but instead cruises on stiffly-held wings within about a hundred metres of the ground, using the rising air heated by the ground below to keep it airborne. The bird’s unusually short tail and long wings, which broaden in the middle, apparently provide the aerodynamic shape needed for achieving this low-energy gliding form of flight. It is much dependent, however, on warm rising air and for this reason Bateleurs don’t usually take to the wing before about 09:00, and they remain grounded on cold, rainy days. On good flying days a bird may cover as much as 300 kilometres. Ever on the lookout during such flights, they quickly circle back for a second pass if something of interest is spotted, and then rapidly spiral down to the ground if there’s a chance of catching prey.</p>",

We were staying in an old farmhouse in the middle of an area which was being conserved for wildlife. In the ceiling of the house was a colony of bats which came streaming out as dusk settled over the area. The Bat Hawk would position itself high in the sky above the house in such a way that, as it came down, it approached the bats from behind as they left the house. I marvelled at the dexterity and proficiency with which the Bat Hawk came down and took a bat out of the stream of bats leaving the house. I was later to watch this species hunting bats around a light in the railway yards of Mutare. A pair of the birds nested in a huge Natal Mahogany Trichilia emetica growing in a nearby park. The nest was situated on a horizontal branch about 25 metres above the ground. Ron Hartley set up a photographic hide, and I was able to photograph the birds at their nest.</p><p>Because the birds feed mainly at dawn and dusk, they are often overlooked even in areas where they occur quite regularly. If seen in flight, the kite-like shape immediately draws attention to a bird, which has an unusual shape compared with other birds of prey. If one finds a bird roosting in a tree the shape is distinctive because of the conspicuous crest. The birds have large, bright orange eyes and a white upper eyelid, which is visible when the bird closes its eyes. The bird is mostly blackish-brown with variable amounts of white on the underparts and pale, almost white, unfeathered legs.</p><p>Because the birds feed mainly at dawn and dusk, they are often overlooked even in areas where they occur quite regularly.

When encountered during the day, the roosting birds are usually easily approached, tending to stay still rather than to fly off. The only time they are active during the day is when they are breeding, when they become aggressive towards potential predators such as crows and other birds of prey. The birds fly rapidly around the approaching predator to drive it away from the nest area. They then continue flying round the nest for a few minutes before returning to the nest or a nearby tree. While making these displays the birds call loudly, often drawing attention to their presence in an area.</p><p>The birds are widely distributed in the northern and eastern parts of South Africa and throughout Zimbabwe wherever suitable trees are available for nesting and roosting and where there are plenty of bats for the birds to feed on throughout the year. If bats are not available, Bat Hawks also take insects and small birds in flight if the opportunity arises. It is interesting that Ron Hartley reported that if a bat was dropped after being caught, the birds did not appear to retrieve the dead bat from the ground. They appear to be able to catch bats so easily that it is more efficient to simply catch a new bat rather than to bother to search for one that was dropped.</p><p>Bat Hawks build a stick nest in a fork on a horizontal branch often at a very considerable height above the ground. The centre of the nest is a deep bowl in which the bird can crouch down so as to be invisible from the ground below. The bowl is lined with leaves and at the nest where I was photographing the bird, green leaves were added during the incubation period.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Bearded Scrub-Robins are birds of forest and woodland, frequenting bushclumps and thickets on termitaria in less wooded areas. They habituate well to people at regularly-used campsites and rest camps, but away from such sites they can be seen to best advantage in the first and last 40 minutes of daylight when they emerge from cover and forage in paths and vehicle tracks through their haunts.</p><p>Bearded Scrub-Robins sand-bathe more frequently than do other robins, perhaps because surface water is rare on the sandy soils found in their preferred habitat. The bird selects a spot with deep, loose sand and sometimes digs a small hollow with quick wisps of its beak; more often it will simply squat, roll onto its side, flapping the free wing and rubbing its outstretched head and neck in the sand. They also bathe in rain puddles or rot holes in tree trunks. At a rot hole site the bird backs into the hollow to bathe, then perches on the rim to preen. They also shower by moving into a clump of leaves with drops of water from rain.</p><p>Bearded Scrub-Robins sand-bathe more frequently than do other robins, perhaps because surface water is rare on the sandy soils found in their preferred habitat.

They also shower by moving into a clump of leaves with drops of water from rain.</p><p>Rot holes and crevices are features of some sand forest trees and those that are dry are favoured as nest sites by Bearded Scrub-Robins. The birds usually choose hollows that face onto a path or glade that is free of undergrowth. Most sites are about 1.5 metres above ground and less than 10&#160;cm in diameter. If the hole is very narrow there may be only a pad of rootlets at the base; more substantial nests are made from bark fibres and Old Man’s Beard lichen Usnea, which is plentiful in the sand forest canopy. Animal hair from Nyala, Bush Pig and Red Duiker may be used in the nest lining.</p><p>Two or three eggs form a clutch, and the incubating female often sits tight in the hollow, her head just visible to anybody walking past. They often build near paths used by people. Most people are not observant of birds and their nests, but diurnal predators such as monkeys generally avoid paths used by people, so by selecting these sites the birds may reduce the risk of predation.</p><p>Given the abundance of predators in African environments, the failure rate of breeding attempts by small birds can be quite high. One of the contributing factors to failure is brood parasitism by cuckoos, and this is something the Bearded Scrub-Robin has to contend with, because sand forest is a favoured haunt of the Red-chested Cuckoo,and in this habitat the Bearded Scrub-Robin is its prime host. Red-chested Cuckoos typically lay chocolate-brown eggs that they successfully foist on Cape Robin-Chats, but in the sand forest they have had to evolve a bluish-tinged white egg with reddish-brown spots to match the colour and pattern of Bearded Scrub-Robin eggs.</p><p>Bearded Scrub-Robins go about their business quietly, but at the beginning of the breeding season in September, the males fill the sand forest with song, and they rank amongst the best songsters in Africa. Typical song consists of a series of whistled phrases separated by pauses lasting 3-19 seconds. Song bouts by one individual may continue for over an hour, quite often starting quietly in the undergrowth, but ultimately ascending into the canopy of one of the giant, lichen-draped Newtonia trees and singing loudly. The song has a ventriloquial character, so even at an elevated song post these birds are not easily seen, but they are a joy to listen to. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Bearded Vulture is a fairly large bird about the same length as the White-backed Vulture. The adults have a white face and golden-coloured neck, the back and wings are black, and the under-parts and upper legs are gold-coloured. They have a small tuft of feathers protruding below the bill, from which they get their name.  The juveniles have a black face, the neck is off-gold and the underparts are rather nondescript. In flight the wedge-shaped tail is conspicuous and distinctive.</p><p>Bearded Vultures occur in parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia, and there are two isolated populations in sub-Saharan Africa, one in Ethiopia and adjacent countries, the other in southern Africa. This endangered and isolated southern population historically extended into the fold mountains of the Western Cape, but is now restricted to the Lesotho massif and the Drakensberg Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. They are normally found at altitudes over 1 500 m above sea level. They are threatened mainly by man’s activities, especially the deliberate poisoning of carcasses. The proposed construction of wind farms in the Lesotho highlands is a particularly worrying development because collisions with wind turbine blades are fatal to birds.</p><p>Bearded Vultures occur in parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia, and there are two isolated populations in sub-Saharan Africa, one in Ethiopia and adjacent countries, the other in southern Africa.

The proposed construction of wind farms in the Lesotho highlands is a particularly worrying development because collisions with wind turbine blades are fatal to birds.</p><p>Like other vultures, the Bearded Vulture is a scavenger but unlike other vultures it has long, narrow wings and is a master at gliding, quartering as low as four metres from the ground at some 70-80 km/hour it is able to cover up to 600 km a day. In this way it finds very small carcasses as well as larger ones. It is more interested in bones and bone marrow than in meat, and when a sizeable carcass is available it removes a large bone, carries it up and drops it from 20-60 metres onto a chosen rock, to shatter the bone into pieces small enough for it to swallow. This favoured rock is known as an ossuary. The birds can swallow bones up to approximately 250 mm long by 35 mm wide. Their extremely acid digestive juices are able to dissolve the bones in the stomach. This vulture also has a long, grooved tongue, presumably to aid the extraction of bone marrow from broken bones.</p><p>Although a breeding pair of Bearded Vultures will drive off any eagle that flies within 250&#160;metres of their nest site, this species is timid for its size and is easily seen off at a carcass or at a vulture restaurant by Cape Vultures and other opportunistic scavengers such as Verreaux’s Eagles. Vulture restaurants help to reduce risk of poisoning, and on occasion as many as 18 Bearded Vultures have been counted at a single vulture restaurant.</p><p>These vultures build a large untidy nest of sticks and line it thickly with wool, hair or skin. The nest is always placed on a cliff, usually in the shelter of a cave or pothole, but occasionally on a ledge on cliffs sheltered from wind. Most pairs have alternative nest sites within their home range and do not usually use the same nest for two consecutive years. The eggs are laid in May or June and they are rufous-orange, mottled with purple or reddish-brown. Up to three eggs are laid, which is unusual for a bird of this size, but they seldom rear more than one chick because the largest chick outcompetes any other chicks for food, causing them to starve. Very small chicks are fed meat but after about a week the proportion of bones is gradually increased. The adults may store small bones for the nestlings in a pothole near to the nest.</p>",

Bearded Woodpeckers have a black forehead spotted with white, with the rest of the crown and nape red in the male and black in the female. Both Bearded and Cardinal Woodpeckers have a large black spot behind the eye and a black stripe leading from the bill down onto the neck, which accounts for the name Bearded Woodpecker. The underparts of the Bearded Woodpecker are quite different to any of our other woodpeckers in that they are barred white on grey.</p><p>The Bearded Woodpecker is widespread and common in the northern half of southern Africa wherever suitable woodlands occur. They are found in a few isolated places in the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Province. Where the habitat is right, this bird is quite common and is usually noticed because of its habit of drumming on a branch. The male selects a branch which resonates and which is usually high in a tree so that the sound carries farthest. It starts drumming at daybreak, and may do so off and on throughout the day. Clearly the bird leaves the drumming branch and goes off to feed and then comes back to advertise his territory. Drumming varies from slow to fast, and it is loud enough to be heard for as much as a kilometre from the drumming branch. We had a male that had found a suitable branch on a very old eucalypt tree; the dead branch was probably about 30&#160;metres above the ground, and the drumming sound could be heard all over the farm on which we lived.</p><p>The Bearded Woodpecker is widespread and common in the northern half of southern Africa wherever suitable woodlands occur.

However, they did not seem to join the mixed-species foraging parties like other woodpeckers. Being much larger birds, their digging activities into dead wood in search of insect grubs is much louder than that of the Cardinal Woodpecker and is also much slower. They dig open the holes of boring insects and, using their barbed tongue, extract the larvae from holes. They also hunt extensively in rough bark and around epiphytic lichen growing on branches. They are big enough to catch and consume small lizards and geckos found under the bark of trees and, like most woodland birds, it has been recorded as catching the termite alates in flight during hatches of the alates.</p><p>They excavate a nest hole in dead wood and are particularly noisy during this time. Both sexes share the labour of excavating the dead wood, taking turns at pecking away in the nest hole. As befits a large bird, the entrance hole is nearly twice as big as that of a Cardinal Woodpecker’s nest hole and because the nest cavity is much wider, the bird must use bigger branches. The nest holes are big enough for the Banded Harrier-Hawk to get a leg in and extract the chicks!  Even so, the nest is often as high as possible in a large tree. Their large nest holes are much sought after by other hole-nesting species such as glossy starlings, Lilac-breasted Rollers and Pearl-spotted and African Scops Owls. However nest holes in a good solid branch are often reused by the same birds in consecutive years. It takes about six weeks from the day of laying the eggs to the emergence of the chicks from the nest. The juveniles accompany the parents while they are feeding through their territory for at least another couple of months before leaving the natal territory. &#9;</p>",

It is seldom found in low-growing open woodlands.</p><p>The Bennett’s Woodpecker was quite common around Marondera in the well-developed brachystegia woodlands. However, when the woodland was thinned out or cut down, the Bennett’s Woodpeckers soon disappeared. They seem to spend most of the day foraging on the ground, feeding mainly on ants, as far as I could see, but would fly up into a tree if disturbed and move rapidly around the tree with a jerking motion, onto the side further away from the disturbance. They open up ants’ nests just below the surface and extract the ants, using their sticky tongue to do so. They also do some foraging on trees, but it is estimated that over 85% of their food is obtained on the ground. They eat the ants and their eggs and pupae, as well as termites and other insects, when found. It is interesting that in Kruger National Park where the species joins other birds being fed by visitors to the camps, it feeds essentially on small crumbs of bread rather than on the larger pieces favoured by birds such as the starlings.</p><p>The birds are territorial throughout the year and may be heard calling at any time. The call is a loud ringing ‘wirrit-wirrit-wirrit’, repeated four or five times. The rate of calling increases towards the end of winter and into early spring, when nesting in the brachystegia woodlands starts. They also have a number of harsh chirring and rattling calls.</p><p>The birds appear to be monogamous breeders, and despite photographing them a number of times at the nest, I was never aware of any helpers. While the Bennett’s Woodpecker often takes over the old nests of Bearded Woodpeckers in the lowveld, in the Marondera area on the plateau, where Bearded Woodpeckers are comparatively rare, Bennett’s Woodpecker is forced to make its own nest. It excavates its nest in dead hardwood trees like the Musasa Brachystegia spiciformis. I did not find a nest in the softer fig trees in which most of the barbets excavated their nests. Like the other woodpeckers, the Bennett’s Woodpecker lays three or four plain white oval eggs on a bed of wood chips at the bottom of the hole. The eggs take approximately 16 to 18 days to hatch, and the chicks are usually between 25 and 30 days old when they leave the nest.</p><p>Although not previously known to be a brood parasite host, a female Bennett’s Woodpecker was recently photographed while feeding a Scaly-throated Honeyguide in the Pafuri area of the Kruger National Park.&#9;</p>",

Male puffbacks fluff out their back feathers, producing a reasonable representation of a snowball in order to intimidate rivals or to impress an actual or potential mate. Because of this habit, these shrikes were thought to be related to the more colourful bush-shrikes which exhibit similar (though less spectacular) displays – a relationship since confirmed by genetic analyses. Display flights in the puffed mode are sometimes undertaken above the canopy. With rapidly beating wings and a buoyant, almost floating progression, they look very much like the flight displays of male Southern Red Bishops.</p><p>Black-backed Puffbacks forage mainly in the crowns of trees, gleaning foliage, twigs and branches, and examining dry seed pods and galls, much as members of the tit family do. They follow the canopy to lower levels on the fringes of forest patches and so can be seen in thickets, though they seldom forage on the ground. They are often members of mixed-species foraging flocks in the dry season and, like many other birds, they hawk ‘flying ants’ (termite alates).</p><p>Black-backed Puffbacks forage mainly in the crowns of trees, gleaning foliage, twigs and branches, and examining dry seed pods and galls, much as members of the tit family do.

The main call, however, is a click-whistle combination, repeated many times. It is one of the characteristic sounds of forest and woodland habi&#173;tats, and a delight to hear in built-up areas when these birds range into wooded suburbs far from their more natural habitat.</p><p>So far as is known, Black-backed Puffbacks breed only once per year, but they do so at any time of the year, especially in the Zimbabwean woodlands. However, most breeding attempts are initiated in spring, just before the onset of the rains. A single annual breeding attempt suggests that breeding success is comparatively high, but no studies have been undertaken to confirm this. It is known, however, that the young birds are fed for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and are allowed to remain in the parental territory (estimated at about four hectares) for up to a year, or at least until the start of the next breeding attempt.</p><p>One of the consequences of foliage and twig gleaning for a comparatively small bird like a puffback is that the size of its prey generally has to be of a size it can swallow. Large insects thus need to be broken into smaller pieces. This is easily done on the ground, but in the canopy any portion of the prey not held in the beak during dismemberment falls and is lost. Some birds cope with this problem by wedging large prey into a cleft, impaling it on a spike, or grasping it with the foot, but puffbacks don’t practise such skills. However, they often tackle such prey when feeding hungry nestlings. Large prey fills more chicks and necessitates fewer individual nest visits, thus saving the parents energy and reducing the risk of revealing the nest’s location to potential predators. To break up large food items into portions that the chicks can swallow, the male puffback holds the prey item firmly in his beak, and the female bites off pieces small enough to feed to the nestlings.</p>",

The back is more greenish while the belly is more violet-blue or black, from which it gets its name.

Also during the breeding season the birds split up into pairs and become very territorial.</p><p>The Black-bellied Starling is typically a bird of the coastal bush and lowland forests, from the southern Cape north into KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique. Interestingly, it is also found inland in central Mozambique along the major rivers where suitable forests occur. It just reaches Zimbabwe in the forest along some of the rivers flowing east into Mozambique. In the southern Cape it is not that common but it is certainly very widespread and is most often noticed when trees like Milkwood Sideroxylon inerme are in fruit and the birds gather in large flocks of 30 or 40 and more, to feed on the abundant fruit available. Once the fruit supply dwindles in winter they behave as though they are insectivorous and spend more and more time on the ground searching for termites and other insects. They will also forage through trees looking for insects in the canopy. The difference is that these groups are just a single species, not a mixed party. They tend to hunt for fruit separately from the Red-winged Starling and Common Starling flocks, which are such a conspicuous feature of late autumn and early winter months in the fruit-bearing trees lining many streets in George. They are certainly regular visitors to our garden throughout the year.</p><p>The birds split up into pairs in September in the southern Cape, and it is conspicuous that the birds visiting our birdbath come in pairs at this time, and the males have the bright red eye which shows they are in breeding. In October one pair of this species dominates my garden and birdbath. They bring their chicks to bath once they fledge. It is at this time also that we hear the pleasant jumbled calls of the male sitting on top of a tree. The birds do call in winter but not to the same extent.</p><p>The birds make use of barbet and woodpecker holes in trees and probably also utilise some natural holes for breeding. It is interesting that unlike many of the hole-nesting birds, the starlings line the bottom of the hole with grass, feathers and other soft material. This means that this species has to find a somewhat larger hole or a hole that has a larger hollow base, with space for the nest material at the bottom. In George the birds also face competition with the Common Starling for nest holes, of which there are probably never enough.</p>",

The Black-crowned Tchagra is the largest, and is probably the most visible and often seen of the four species which occur in southern Africa. It is widespread and often common in the woodlands of the region. It is able to survive in the dry thornveld of the central Kalahari and also in the moist woodlands of the Zimbabwe plateau, showing that it is probably a generalist which is able to make use of any form of invertebrate prey within the habitat in which it occurs.</p><p>The Black-crowned Tchagra has a black head with a light eye stripe below the black crown and then a black streak running from the bill through the eye to the back of the head. The light-coloured streak above the eye is very conspicuous because it is so different to the black above and below.&#160;</p><p>The Black-crowned Tchagra has a black head with a light eye stripe below the black crown and then a black streak running from the bill through the eye to the back of the head. The light-coloured streak above the eye is very conspicuous because it is so different to the black above and below.&#160;</p><p>The feature that reveals this bird’s presence throughout the year is its incredible call. It sounds almost as though it is playing ‘musical scales’ while it learns to play a penny whistle. The calls start very low and slow and gradually get higher and faster. Although the bird usually gives the call from the cover of a bush, it will often sit at the top of a bush or even call as it flies across its territory. The female may join in towards the end of the male’s call and continue with a similar call after the male stops. They also have a number of other calls which may be heard, particularly during the breeding season when the pair are maintaining a territory.</p><p>The Black-crowned Tchagra is usually found in pairs although towards the end of the breeding season in summer the young of the year may be present with the adults forming a small group. They feed on the ground beneath bushes but will often move away from cover above them as they feed. Should danger threaten, they run at very high speed back to the nearest cover, not normally flying. They feed essentially on insects and other similar prey, with grasshoppers, especially the green sort, being brought to the chicks.</p><p>It is interesting that they seem to be able to cope with hairy caterpillars, by going to the trouble of wiping the hairs off on a branch before eating the caterpillar. One of the most interesting features of this species is that they have been recorded catching tadpoles and eating them. This is probably the case where pools of water are diminishing, with the result that tadpoles have become readily available to birds. These birds are also known to kill small snakes and lizards.</p><p>The pair starts proclaiming territory in early spring as nesting occurs fairly early in the spring in the woodlands in Zimbabwe. The birds build a rather flimsy-looking nest of thin rootlets or perhaps very thin leaf petioles or twigs, and these are bound together with lots of spider web around the top of the nest. It is interesting that the nest is often placed in a relatively thin bush and is fairly conspicuous, but the birds are still very successful in hatching and rearing their chicks. Observing a nest which had eggs, I noticed that the birds were very careful when approaching the nest. However, once the chicks had hatched and the birds were returning with food, they were far less cautious about returning to the nest.</p>",

Although relatively few birds were recaptured in ringing studies, suggesting a nomadic element in the population, some individuals apparently remained at the same site for up to five years. Black-faced Waxbills are usually found in pairs or family parties, with larger flocks probably passive gatherings at a productive feeding site. They are often inconspicuous, and more easily located by their loud contact calls. Grass seeds are collected both on the ground and while perched on the seedheads, and these birds also take nectar from aloes. After breeding they sometimes roost in old weaver nests, including nests of Southern Masked Weavers, White-browed Sparrow-Weavers and Red-billed Buffalo-Weavers, and up to 30 birds have been found inside a single nest.</p><p>When they breed, Black-faced Waxbills are monogamous, nesting as isolated pairs. It seems likely that pairs stay together for successive seasons, as allopreening is often observed in birds perched together after bathing, even when not breeding. Members of a pair perform a greeting display when they are reunited, even after a short time apart. Perching close together, the birds adopt an upright posture, then bend down, bill-wipe, and return to the upright position. Apart from their plumage differences,&#173; males and females have distinctive contact calls; a sex-specific difference which is already apparent in juvenile birds soon after they have fledged.</p><p>When they breed, Black-faced Waxbills are monogamous, nesting as isolated pairs.

The nest is built by both sexes, with most of the material collected by the male. It is a bulky ball of grass with the entrance on the underside, through a protruding spout of grass stems. Nests are placed in the centre of a thorny tree, at least three metres above the ground, and the same site may be used for successive breeding attempts with new nests near the old structures. Sometimes there is a cup-shaped structure on top of the nest. This so-called ‘cock’s nest’ is popularly supposed to mislead predators and discourage them from searching further, but there is no real evidence that it serves such a function. The egg chamber is lined with finer grass seedheads, and some feathers; both members of the pair continue to bring in lining material during incubation. Male and female share incubation duties and both feed the nestlings. In central Namibia, Black-faced Waxbills are evidently occasional hosts of the brood parasitic Shaft-tailed Whydah, since some of these whydahs mimic their songs.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This attractive little canary has an extensive distribution across the dry western half of southern Africa, from Damaraland in Namibia to the southern coastal plains of the Western Cape. Like many species of arid and semi-arid shrublands, it is nomadic because of the high variability in rainfall over much of its range. It shows a tendency to move west and south in the winter, and east in summer, to coincide with the local rainy seasons; nonetheless, its occurrence at any one place is erratic and unpredictable. In the Little Karoo near Oudtshoorn it sometimes appears in large numbers after good rains but in other years, in spite of good veld conditions, it is absent.</p><p>In 1936, E. Leonard Gill published his classic A First Guide to South African Birds, a forerunner of present-day field guides. He called the Black-headed Canary the Mountain Canary, a name that was frequently used by Somerset West birders well into the 1960s. Gill’s choice of name seems something of a misnomer – the bird does occur in semi-arid shrublands on rocky hillsides but it is seldom encountered on mountainsides, preferring the open plains.</p><p>In 1936, E.

Gill’s choice of name seems something of a misnomer – the bird does occur in semi-arid shrublands on rocky hillsides but it is seldom encountered on mountainsides, preferring the open plains.</p><p>Like most seedeaters this species is dependent on standing water and, at suitable drinking holes, they can be seen by the hundred. They have benefited greatly from the development of stock watering points in many dry areas – the permanent water allowing the birds to remain in areas which otherwise would only be visited after rain. In the late afternoon at one seepage point below the Nuweveld Escarpment near Beaufort West, upwards of 250 Black-headed Canaries regularly come to drink. Both Lanner and Pere&#173;grine Falcons frequently hunt in the area, resulting in some very jittery behaviour on the part of the canaries and doves approaching the water.</p><p>As in so many species of semi-arid regions, their breeding is linked to rainfall and veld condition. On the western plains of Little Namaqualand, where the winter rains are fairly reliable, breeding occurs from July to October. When dry conditions persist over the Karoo, and the south coast has received substantial rain, there is often an influx of Black-headed Canaries into the Overberg and the adjacent coastal belt to the east. As with many other canaries, nests can be placed in close proximity to each other – at times less than 40 metres apart. Incubating birds tend to sit tight. One female that was flushed from a nest near Red Stone Hills in the Little Karoo performed a dramatic injury-feigning distraction flight to draw the observer’s attention away from the nest.</p><p>Two distinct races are recognised. The nominate race is perhaps the most attractive, with the male having a striking black head that contrasts strongly with his chestnut back. In the second race, leucolaema,which in the past has been given full species status by some authors and named the Damara Canary, the male has a pied head. There is a wide overlap of their ranges and it is not uncommon to see the two races in mixed parties. Whether the two races ever hybridise is, however, unknown.</p><p>The Black-headed Canary is certainly not threatened. It is very tolerant of disturbed vegetation and will even breed on old agricultural lands, or beside busy roads, provided there are a few suitable bushes. It is a popular cage bird: the extent of trapping is not known but this could be a threat in the future, given the huge increase in wildlife trading.</p>",

Thus in pattern it resembles a dull version of the Yellow-fronted Canary, which the Black-throated Canary replaces in much of the semi-arid west, while the two species may overlap in more mesic woodland. In the hand this is a small, almost delicate bird; quite a contrast to other feisty and robust canaries, which do not hesitate to bite!

The outside of the nest is often covered with bits of lichen or bark which help to camouflage the nest but, unlike the batis’s nests, this lichen is not put across the entire outside of the nest. They lay two or three blue eggs with fine brown speckles around the thicker end. The eggs are laid any time from approximately September through to February, the later dates probably being second breeding attempts. The eggs take 16 to 18 days to hatch with the female doing all the incubation and being fed on the nest by the male. She continues to brood the chicks while they are small and feeds them with insect prey delivered by the male. As the chicks grow and get a cover of feathers, the female leaves the nest and helps to provision them. The chicks normally spend about 16 days in the nest before fledging.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>With its distinctive plumage pattern, this lapwing should never be misidentified except in the case of the rather brown juveniles who, however, remain with their parents for some time. Over the last 80 years this wader has benefited from man’s activities, increasing and expanding its range quite dramatically. The creation of a large variety of freshwater wetlands, from small farm dams to huge irrigation impoundments and extensive sewage treatment ponds, have vastly increased the area of suitable habitat. They have also provided a year-round environment, and the birds no longer have to undertake extensive movements to find suitable sites to survive drought periods. At the same time, however, Blacksmith Lapwings are not totally dependent on water and forage quite extensively on open mown or grazed grassland, usually when it is sufficiently green to support invertebrate life. With the increased population, small numbers are now establishing themselves in estuarine habitats, mainly at salt marsh pools. Extreme saline conditions such as those at saltworks are generally avoided, but birds do forage on beds of seaweed thrown up on the seashore.</p><p>The Blacksmith Lapwing is found throughout southern Africa, extending north into Angola, the southern DRC and through Tanzania to southern Kenya. With such a scattered population and the fact that it tends to occur in pairs, family parties and small groups, it is very difficult to estimate overall numbers. A very rough figure of between 100&#160;000 and 1 million birds is currently accepted, but the true figure probably lies in the lower part of this range. The highest density of birds in southern Africa occurs from the Western and Eastern Cape through the highveld into Zimbabwe and northern Botswana. Within that area the bird is variably resident to nomadic or locally migratory. Residency is usually short-term and few adults remain in an area for longer than two seasons. Migratory behaviour occurs mainly in the north, with birds from the high-rainfall areas of Zambia, southern DRC and Tanzania apparently moving south during the wet summer months when habitats become inundated and overgrown. These birds certainly reach Zimbabwe but the southern limits are unknown as they mix with more resident populations in Botswana and South Africa.</p><p>The Blacksmith Lapwing is found throughout southern Africa, extending north into Angola, the southern DRC and through Tanzania to southern Kenya.

The nest is normally situated close to water, although may end up in quite dry habitats if the water recedes rapidly. The normal clutch is of three to four eggs. The young leave the nest within a few hours and feed independently of their parents, although overseen by them, usually over damp ground or at the water’s edge. Where they are undisturbed and predators are few, the young feed during the day. Mostly, however, they feed in the early morning and evening, sometimes continuing to forage quite late on moonlit nights. They tend not to wade in water unless attempting to avoid a preda&#173;tor. Once the young have fledged, family groups may coalesce and form loose flocks and, in areas where they are plentiful, may form communal nocturnal roosts of up to 500 birds. In such roosts they are very alert, and there is little chance of a predator creeping up on them undetected.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The common name of this species prompts an examination of the aptness of bustard names generally. Why do we call some small members of this family ‘bustards’ and others ‘korhaans’? The reasons are largely historical and the latter name obviously has South African Afrikaans roots. It has been argued that while it is acceptable to call the endemic species ‘korhaans’, we should respect the sensibilities of the broader African audience and use the name ‘bustard’ for those Otididae that range more widely through the continent, as in the case of the present species. But this results in the artificial and awkward situation where some members of the same genus end up being called ‘bustards’ and others ‘korhaans’, i.e. relevant to members of Eupodotis and Lophotis. Perhaps it is time to just simply call them all what they are: bustards, and relegate ‘korhaan’ to the realm of Afrikaans bird names, where it arguably belonged in the first place. The first part of the name of the Black-bellied Bustard is also inappropriate relevant to the female of this species, with her lily-white underwear. The most striking feature about the Black-bellied Bustard is its long-necked and long-legged appearance that imbues it with a rather elegant impression compared with the decidedly dumpy air of most members of the family.</p><p>The call of the species by contrast, is markedly lacking in grace and dignity; a firmly unbirdlike burp followed an age later by an indistinct “pop”. But when the male takes to the air in his display flight he becomes a creature of consummate beauty. He circles around like a giant butterfly with exaggerated wingbeats emphasising the dazzling white patches covering most of the upper wing. On completion, he slowly parachutes back to earth with his wings held high in a V-shaped dihedral before disappearing back into the long grass. Once seen, it is an extravaganza never to be forgotten.</p><p>The call of the species by contrast, is markedly lacking in grace and dignity; a firmly unbirdlike burp followed an age later by an indistinct “pop”.

On completion, he slowly parachutes back to earth with his wings held high in a V-shaped dihedral before disappearing back into the long grass. Once seen, it is an extravaganza never to be forgotten.</p><p>Black-bellied Bustards, like the other small southern African bustards with spectacular aerial displays, are not monogamous and are virtually always found alone. Females typically lay their eggs quite distant from the male display grounds. The eggs are very similar to those of other bustards in their background colour and markings but differ profoundly in being almost spherical in shape, quite unlike the elliptical eggs of other bustards and indeed ground-nesting birds generally.</p><p>The Black-bellied Bustard has an extensive range that extends as far as West Africa. Although the species does not have the most extensive local range of the southern African bustards, it seems to span the widest extremes of habitat. Reminiscent of the White-bellied Bustard, it prefers areas of tall dense grassland but does not seem to mind whether this requirement is met in cool, high-altitude, open grasslands, such as at Wakkerstroom in the eastern Highveld, or in the sweltering, low-lying, dense woodlands along the eastern littoral and far northern parts of the region.</p><p>This bustard extends as far south as the former Trans-kei region of the Eastern Cape. Its populations south of the Tugela River, however, have been particularly reduced and fragmented in the face of habitat loss to the extent of apparent imminent extinction in this region. The damage stems largely from dense human settlement, overgrazing, and the establishment of vast dreary monocultures of sugar cane and commercial afforestation. Its presence at the extreme other end of the range in Namibia south-west of the Caprivi Strip, as shown in the southern African bird atlas, requires confirmation, as these records may be based on misidentifications.</p>",

Melanoleuca) in southern africa is unclear (see discussion under white-bellied storm petrel). Black-bellied storm petrels went extinct at south africa’s marion island following the introduction of cats to the island in 1949 and apparently have not re-colonised the island since cats were eradicated in the early 1990s, possibly as a result of predation by introduced house mice.

They are the most common albatross off the Cape in winter, when it is not unusual for more than a thousand to gather at a single trawler as it hauls its net. They are less common farther north, especially off the east coast. Young birds remain at the Cape year-round, probably for their first 3-4 years, taking advantage of the easy pickings to be had in the form of offal and discards from fishing vessels. However, they are often outnumbered at fishing vessels by the larger and more dominant Shy Albatrosses.</p><p>Black-browed Albatrosses are unusual among albatrosses in having age-related changes in their underwing pattern. Juveniles fledge with mostly dark underwings, the centres of which gradually whiten with each successive moult. However, even as adults, they retain broader black margins to their underwings than any other mollymawk in the region. Adults are readily identified by their orange bills with cherry-red tips, but juveniles have grey bills with blackish tips that are easily confused with young Shy Albatrosses if the dark underwing isn’t seen.</p><p>Black-browed Albatrosses are unusual among albatrosses in having age-related changes in their underwing pattern.

However, very few of the birds from the large populations on the Falklands and islands off Cape Horn reach the Cape; these birds mostly winter off South America. After breeding, adults from South Georgia forage around their breeding sites for a week or so, presumably to build up their energy reserves, then commute rapidly across the Atlantic to the Cape, covering the 4 500 kilometres in as little as four days. Juveniles also cross the Atlantic rapidly, arriving within 20 days of fledging. In mid-May 1984, a severe storm caused large numbers of recently fledged Black-browed Albatrosses to come ashore along the west coast north of Cape Town. It was bizarre to see them sitting on the beach and in adjacent fields.</p><p>Fishery discards make up the bulk of their diet along the shelf break of southern Africa. Their distribution is closely linked to recent fishing effort, and unlike Shy Albatrosses, they seldom forage on schooling fish over the continental shelf. However, they regularly undertake long, looping flights out into oceanic waters where they presumably target natural prey. They can plunge-dive, and swim underwater for up to 20 seconds, attaining depths of at least 5 metres.</p><p>Despite their abundance off southern Africa, Black-browed Albatrosses are listed as Endangered due to ongoing decreases in breeding populations. At South Georgia, numbers have halved over the last couple of decades, and continue to decrease. The main cause of their decrease appears to be accidental mortality on fishing gear, both longlines and demersal trawl warps. Climate change also has reduced the extent of sea ice around the Antarctic Peninsula, affecting the availability of Antarctic Krill for birds breeding at South Georgia. Historically, many birds were caught at sea for food, and ‘malmok’ was offered for sale in Cape Town. Fortunately, this practice has largely ceased.</p>",

That a bird of this size is able to hang almost motionless so as to scan the open country below is quite remarkable. The birds occur across much of southern Africa although they are less common from the Karoo southwards. In the open Kalahari they are both common and conspicuous. They are perhaps equally common in Zimbabwe’s tall woodlands but are less visible than in the open Kalahari.</p><p>The birds are about 60-70 centimetres long with a 1.8 metre wingspan and blackish brown upperparts. The throat and upper breast is a dark brown, while the rest of the belly and body is white, as are the feathers of the legs. Like all snake eagles they have bare feet and tarsi – the lower part of the legs. The wings are white with two distinct dark bands towards the trailing edge. These are only clearly visible from below when the bird is in flight; as such they are a very important means of identification of this species.

They are sometimes shot because of mistaken identity for Martial Eagles, and also drown while attempting to drink from steep-sided farm reservoirs.</p><p>The birds appear to be resident in some areas, but there is a certain amount of nomadic movement. It was noticeable in the Marondera area that the number of birds increased quite dramatically in winter. In the drier parts of southern Africa they probably move in response to rainfall and the abundance of prey.</p><p>The birds feed mainly on reptiles, especially snakes. They have been recorded as catching large snakes like Cape Cobras and Puffadders, but my observations were that smaller snakes like the Skaapsteker Psammophylax tritaeniatus and Olive Grass Snake  Psammophis siblans were more often brought to the nest. They drop onto the snake, catching or grasping it behind the head, where the feet crush and break the neck or back. If they fail to do this with the initial attack, the snake may well resist by winding itself around the bird. It has been recorded that in these circumstances, both the snake and the bird perished. They also catch lizards, even fairly large leguaans up to about a metre in length. Other prey includes chameleons, rodents and occasionally birds. In Zimbabwe at least, they gather at larger termite alate hatches.</p><p>The birds build a saucer-shaped nest about 60-70 cm in diameter which may be placed in the top of an acacia tree, where the centre has been pushed down so that the remaining branches form a halo to conceal the nest. In Zimbabwe several nests that I saw were built near the top of leafy trees so that the nests were well concealed by the foliage of the tree from below or from the side, but were visible from above. Interestingly, both the Brown- and Black-chested Snake Eagles sometimes build nests on horizontal forks within large trees in Zimbabwe. The birds normally lay one egg. It is interesting that when feeding the chicks, they brought the snakes which they had swallowed into their crop, with the tail hanging out. The larger chicks grasp the protruding tail tip to pull the snake out onto the nest.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Black-collared Barbets are familiar birds in the eastern half of southern Africa. They are often detected by their characteristic duets, usually voiced on exposed, easily visible perches, and their blood-red heads, large black bills, and bordering black breast bands render them a striking and easily identified species. The duet song, often rendered as ‘too-puddly, too-puddly…’ or by ‘blackcollared-blackcollared-blackcollared’ (as this tells the beginner the bird’s name), is commonly preceded by a harsh, growling ‘grurrr, grurrr’, uttered by one, or both, of the birds, following these notes with the first, high-pitched ‘too’. The mate immediately responds with the ‘puddly’ call. The bird initiating the exchange may sway from side to side, while the ‘puddly’ caller often bobs up and down. This altogether spectacular vocal display may be repeated 10 to 20 or more times. If a mate is absent, a single bird can evidently perform both parts of the duet by itself. These barbets also have an alarm or threat call, a protracted ‘snaaarr’, which is apt to be uttered whenever they see a honeyguide nearby.</p><p>Black-collared Barbets are usually seen in pairs or in groups of three to eight birds. Several pairs usually share a favoured roost tree in which there may be more than one hole. Normally, however, only one hole is used for roosting, with 11 or more birds sleeping together. Popular roosts are used year after year or until the dead branch or trunk collapses.</p><p>Black-collared Barbets are usually seen in pairs or in groups of three to eight birds.

Popular roosts are used year after year or until the dead branch or trunk collapses.</p><p>Because they are fruit eaters, Black-collared Barbets often visit gardens with fruit trees, and can be attracted to garden bird-feeding sites that offer a fruit menu, such as banana, papaya and apple. They are apt to be quite aggressive, not only to other barbets, but also to other fruit-eating birds. They quickly habituate to people and dogs, but they are less confiding when excavating a nest hole. Nesting is a secretive business, and close approach by an observer is not encouraged. Black-collared Barbets, like many other barbets, are co-operative breeders, often having one or more helpers when excavating the nest chamber, incubating the eggs and feeding the nestlings after the eggs have hatched. The helpers are thought to be subadult young from a previous brood. Unlike some woodpeckers, barbets find it difficult to excavate holes in live wood, but they have no problems with dead wood. Black-collared Barbets can excavate a nest hole in a soft sisal log or a dead fig tree branch in a couple of days, but may require a week to complete the entrance hole and 10-50 cm-deep tunnel and chamber in harder wood.</p><p>Their evident penchant for keeping their nest site undiscovered does not help them avoid the attentions of Lesser Honeyguides, which frequently parasitise this species. To prevent this, the male Black-collared Barbet commonly occupies a perch close to the nest-hole entrance. The honeyguides are a step (or wing) ahead of this sentry strategy, however, because the male honeyguide arrives to look at the nest hole and is promptly chased off and pursued by the irate barbet. The female honey&#173;guide then slips into the nest, taking only 5-10 seconds to lay her egg and escapes before the male barbet returns to his sentry perch. Despite her mate’s effective decoy action, she has to hope that the female barbet is not occupying the nest chamber. If she deposits her egg before the barbet has laid any of hers, the barbet will remove it from the nest chamber. The stakes are high in this game, because if the honeyguide succeeds in laying an egg in the barbet’s nest, its chick invariably kills all its foster siblings. &#9;</p>",

The shape and the size of this bird are typical of most of our coucals, but the Black Coucal is the only rufous-winged coucal in southern Africa which has black underparts. It is interesting that the birds show relatively little variation in their plumage throughout their vast range.</p><p>In Zimbabwe, during the breeding season, this is the only coucal which inhabits moist open grasslands and wet grasslands along streams on the plateau. It is here that the birds nest during mid- and late summer. Even in these grasslands, however, the bird has a rather peculiar distribution because it will appear in a particular grassland, but not in any other similar grassland nearby. This suggests that its local distribution may be determined by food supply.</p><p>In Zimbabwe, during the breeding season, this is the only coucal which inhabits moist open grasslands and wet grasslands along streams on the plateau.

This suggests that its local distribution may be determined by food supply.</p><p>I saw this species many times in the wet summer months when I lived in Marondera in Zimbabwe. The birds appeared shortly after the first rains fell in late October or November. However, active nesting did not start until the open grasslands along the streams, or in vleis, were wet underfoot. By then, the grasses were a metre or more high, and the birds would disappear into the grass the moment an observer moved out of the woodland cover into the grassland. Fortunately they made use of the isolated bushes which dotted the area and provided perches from which the birds could survey the surrounding area. The Black Coucal, sitting on top of a bush and sporting its black breeding dress, is very conspicuous in green grassland. It appears that it is the female who is seen on top of bushes because she maintains the territory within which she may have up to three males breeding. However, in my experience in the Marondera area, it appeared that most breeding territories were occupied by just a single pair. This could have been because being near the watershed, the streams were small and the grasslands surrounding them were seldom more than 100 metres wide.</p><p>Breeding starts with the male building a ball-shaped nest of grass, rather like that of the Senegal Coucal, in the living grasses. The nest is placed well above the ground so as to avoid being flooded during heavy rain. Typically, the male approaches and leaves the nest by creeping through the grass but might, on occasion, fly directly to the nest. This enables an observer to pinpoint the position of the nest, which is impossible if the male makes a concealed approach! Incubation is carried out entirely by the male. It is also the male which brings food to the chicks, arriving at the nest with the bright green grasshoppers which are so common in the moist grasslands on the Zimbabwe plateau. These grasshoppers are also much sought after by many other birds which inhabit the same grasslands, including Yellow-throated Longclaws.</p><p>Within our area there appears to be a certain amount of regular movement, including birds moving in winter from the Zimbabwe plateau to lower-lying areas of Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and birds moving north from northern KwaZulu-Natal at the same time. In particularly wet summers, birds also move into grasslands in areas in both Kwa-Zulu-Natal and the former Transvaalwhich have become inundated and very rank but which are not occupied in years of average rainfall. During such wet years, some have even made their way as far south as Durban.</p>",

It is not afraid of being in the open but likes to have cover to run into when alarmed. And when it is hidden from view it regularly reveals its presence with its ‘cackle-and-wheeze, cackle-and-wheeze’ duet. Other members of the family also join in. They are common waterside birds of sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia and all the way down to the Cape, save for the dry parts of the Kalahari and Karoo. They may turn up in all sorts of wetland – probably in the course of post-breeding dispersal of youngsters – but they are primarily birds of perennially wet places.</p><p>It is fascinating how a family of such reclusive birds as the crakes and rails can include such extroverts. I remember watching a Streaky-breasted Flufftail in an aviary overlooked from the dining-room window. The oblong aviary had marshy cover down each side with a strip of lawn between. The flufftail came to the edge of the cover on one side, apparently intent on crossing over to the other side but the sun was shining on the intervening lawn. It ventured out into the sun briefly but turned back into its cover. It then walked a few metres up along the edge of the cover until it came to the shadow of one of the poles crossing over the aviary to support the wire-netting roof. The bird then crossed over the lawn by walking slowly and with great care to keep within the shadow of the roof pole. That is the sort of personality that many crakes have. Black Crakes have a completely different disposition and personality. But ‘personality’ is such an anthropomorphic concept that South Africans tend to dismiss such talk as allowing sentiment to contaminate their scientific approach to ornithology. Here we tend to attribute all changes either to degradation of habitat or global warming, and yet personality is just an aspect of behaviour, which is an entirely acceptable field of study. Other continents produce many papers relating to the disposition of birds.</p><p>It is fascinating how a family of such reclusive birds as the crakes and rails can include such extroverts.

In most cases this occurs in species that have a naturally social disposition. They move about in small groups with the helpers coming from the ranks of last year’s young.  In Black Crakes, however, the adults are essentially monogamous and territorial.  The rest of the family is made up of members of earlier broods of the year, and these youngsters move away once breeding is over. A pair may, however, have as many as four broods in one season, with successive clutches being laid as soon as three weeks after the previous clutch hatched. In these circumstances the helpers begin their services when they are only half grown. This practice includes beak-to-beak feeding of the new brood and was first noticed among aviary-held birds. But it also takes place in the wild. Perhaps it reflects that even in a perennially wet habitat, optimal breeding conditions occur for only a short period. It is then necessary to produce as many young as possible because conditions in all wetlands are so unstable.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The night herons are a distinctive group, represented around the world by seven species, three in the genus Nycticorax and four in Gorsachius: one representative of each occurs in southern Africa. As the name implies, these species are all primarily crepuscular or nocturnal, spending the daylight hours inactive, perched in a concealed position in a tree or reed bed and only venturing forth to hunt at twilight. The Black-crowned Night Heron is one of the best-known and most widespread herons, its range around the world running a close second only to that of the Great Egret and being slightly larger than that of the Striated Heron. It occurs across much of North and South America, through Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and right across sub-Saharan Africa. It is absent only from Australia where a related species, the Nankeen Night Heron N. caledonicus, takes its place.</p><p>Compared with other herons, Black-crowned Night Herons are relatively short-legged and they have a squat, hunched-up appearance at rest, compounded by resting with their heads drawn into their shoulders. Adults are crisply coloured in black, white, grey and dark green. They also have two or three distinctive, long white plumes extending from the nape. Juveniles look very different, being spotted and streaked in shades of brown, grey, buff and white: they retain this plumage for 1-2 years before assuming adult colours. Night Herons have unusually large eyes. In the case of the Black-crowned Night Heron they are crimson, giving the bird’s eyes a rather bloodshot look. Large eyes are an adaptation for their nocturnal lifestyle. On several occasions, however, I have found dead birds lying beneath power lines crossing the Nylsvlei marshes and these, presumably, were night-flying casualties.</p><p>Compared with other herons, Black-crowned Night Herons are relatively short-legged and they have a squat, hunched-up appearance at rest, compounded by resting with their heads drawn into their shoulders.

The bulk of the European population migrates south into Africa in winter and the recovery in Mozambique of a bird ringed in Romania suggests that at least some of these reach the subregion. Another ringing recovery also demonstrates the extent of their potential to move – in this case a nestling ringed on the Witwatersrand was subsequently recovered in the Congo’s Katanga Province.</p><p>In years of extensive flooding on the floodplain of the Nyl River in South Africa’s Limpopo Province, many hundreds of these birds arrive, seemingly from nowhere, to exploit the temporarily abundant fish stocks. At dusk in such years, when all the diurnal herons are streaming back to the safety of the reed beds to roost, the night herons are pouring out in the opposite direction to feed, and the air is filled with their harsh, sharp ‘wak’ call notes. The scientific name Nycticorax, meaning ‘raven of the night’, perhaps alludes to this distinctive raven-like call. Even when it has become too dark to see, the wak calls continue as if they are providing a form of air traffic control. When feeding large chicks, the night herons usually start feeding about midafternoon and may make several trips back to the colony before dark.</p><p>When hunting, Black-crowned Night Herons behave in very much the same way as other herons. They fish by wading slowly or remaining poised and alert at one spot ready to strike when a fish comes within range. They also swim. On several evenings while watching an open-water pond from a hide after dark, I spotted a bird swimming like a duck in water two metres deep. Torch-light revealed the bird to be a Black-crowned Night Heron. Fish provide their main food source, but they will consume frogs and tadpoles, aquatic insects, lizards, small snakes and other live creatures that they are capable of handling – even other birds.</p><p>&#160;</p>",

They have a wide distribution in the woodlands in Zimbabwe, northern Botswana and in Limpopo and the North West Province. They are limited to the east in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. They are found in the forests along the coast and within the mountains of the Western Cape.</p><p>The Black Cuckooshrike male is a black bird with a conspicuous orange gape, or line, at the base of the bill. This stands out in the field despite its apparently small size.   They are also less conspicuous than the similar Black Flycatcher and Square-tailed Drongo because they seldom hawk insects, usually foraging along branches and in the canopy of the trees in the woodlands and forests where all three species occur. The female Black Cuckooshrike, on the other hand, looks completely different and she has markings reminiscent of the Common Cuckoo. The back is brownish with darker brown markings and the breast is white, barred with very dark grey or black. She has yellow markings on the wings and tail and because the pair often occurs together, she provides an instant identification for the male. In flight its wingbeats are generally much slower than the other two species, so that at times it would appear that the bird is not stable when flying.</p><p>The Black Cuckooshrike male is a black bird with a conspicuous orange gape, or line, at the base of the bill.

They have an insect-like trill ‘kreee’ which is used throughout the year. They also have a lower-pitched rolling call. Other calls have been described as churring, unmusical, winding ‘chwrr, chwrr, chwrr’ repeated up to 20 times. Also a similar but soft ‘seeu, seeu, seeu’ and the young have a quiet, repetitive ‘tsit’ hunger call once fledged.</p><p>It is a common member of mixed-species bird parties in both forest and woodlands but may be overlooked because it spends most of the time gleaning insects in the canopy of the trees. It feeds mainly on insects, ants, and particularly hairy caterpillars - perhaps the ‘cuckooshrike’ name is apt, as the cuckoos also eat hairy caterpillars!</p><p>When displaying, the male raises the feathers on the rump in flight and also opens the mouth to display the bright orange gape. This gives the bird a peculiar hump-backed appearance, and the open orange mouth looks like an orange breast. The latter has caused many a birdwatcher to look in vain in the book for an orange-breasted black bird!</p><p>In common with many of the smaller insectivorous birds in the woodlands, and indeed in many small birds, the female does all the building of the nest, although the male usually accompanies her on trips to collect nest material. The nest is mainly lichen or Usnea held together with spider web. It is lined with much finer material, often hair-like pieces of vegetation or even hair, if this is available.</p><p>The nest is typical of many birds in the woodlands in that it is a cup-shaped nest built into the fork of a tree. In Zimbabwe the nests are carefully covered with lichen to make them match the branches on which they are built. However, watching these birds nest further south towards Gauteng, I noticed that the nests were built on branches which did not have a covering of lichen, and yet the birds still covered the nest with pale grey lichen. This made the nests incredibly conspicuous on a bare-barked branch. A farmer told me that he had never seen the Black Cuckooshrikes successfully rear chicks because either the eggs or the chicks were taken by predators before the chicks were fully developed. Perhaps this is why the birds become forest dwellers more than woodland dwellers in the southern part of their range. Although the incubation (about 23 days) and nestling (24 days) periods of this species are not as long as the White-breasted Cuckooshrike, they are longer than similar-sized birds, like the flycatchers and drongos.</p><p>The female seems to do most of the incubation and brooding of the small chicks while the male brings food to her and the chicks. Once the chicks have some covering of feathers the female joins the male in searching for food, bringing a lot of soft green caterpillars to the chicks.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The mournful, monotonous dirge of the Black Cuckoo – ‘I’m so, saaaad’ – is the first indication of its arrival in spring in southern Africa. In this regard, it is a typical cuckoo – most members of this family are very vocal but visually unobtrusive. If seen clearly, though, it is easily recognisable by its blackish plumage. It could perhaps be confused with a male Black Cuckoo-shrike, but has much longer, pointed wings, a feature shared with many other cuckoos. This may reflect the family’s peripatetic lifestyle, for virtually all southern African species are migratory and fly varying distances between their summer and winter ranges. In the case of the Black Cuckoo, it arrives here from Equatorial Africa, and spreads southwards throughout the woodlands, savannas and acacia thickets of the eastern and northern parts of the subregion during our summer.</p><p>It comes here to feed and breed, and again displays typical cuckoo preferences and traits – it is insectivorous, specialising in caterpillars which are gleaned from foliage, and it is a brood parasite, laying its eggs mainly in the nests of boubous. All birders and most non-birders are familiar with the latter behaviour; cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds, which birds then do all the work, incubating the eggs and providing and caring for the cuckoo chick; indeed, the English word cuckold (derived from the pejorative form of cuckoo) has the same connotation.</p><p>It comes here to feed and breed, and again displays typical cuckoo preferences and traits – it is insectivorous, specialising in caterpillars which are gleaned from foliage, and it is a brood parasite, laying its eggs mainly in the nests of boubous.

For example, the female Black Cuckoo keeps a prospective host’s nest under surveillance until she is certain that she can deposit one of her eggs – and only one – in it, undetected. At the same time, she removes a single host egg, thereby masking her action. This seems so deliberately deceptive that it is difficult to believe that the bird is acting ‘instinctively’ and without premeditated malice. A further refinement in the case of the Black Cuckoo is that it has well-developed egg mimicry: the cuckoo’s eggs are virtually indistinguishable from the host’s – indeed a careless or inexperienced human observer could easily overlook the odd-egg-out in a boubou’s clutch. Acceptance of the cuckoo egg by the host is a fundamental first step to brood parasitism.</p><p>The relationship between cuckoos and their hosts is one of tension and one-upmanship – where natural selection drives the cuckoo to improve its ‘deception’ and the host strives to improve its ‘detection’ in an evolutionary arms race. Because reproductive success (for both the cuckoo and the host) is central to this relationship, this is a fertile field for natural selection. It is thus probable that the female Black Cuckoo chooses boubou nests where the host is in the process of egg-laying so that her chick will not be disadvantaged by shrike nestlings that hatch earlier and are already large and competitive. The slightly shorter incubation period of the cuckoo (14 days as opposed to 16 or 17 for the host) is a mechanism to ensure this too. At least some cuckoo embryos start to develop in the female’s oviduct, giving them a head start over their foster siblings.</p><p>The newly hatched cuckoo imprints on the adult shrikes, raising questions about how it later recognises its own kind. Once fledged, come autumn, it experiences an unrelenting urge to fly northwards, despite the sedentary nature of its foster parents. How it finds its way is one of the marvels and mysteries of the animal world! The survival of an individual Black Cuckoo is fraught with these sorts of challenges resulting from its extraordinary, different lifestyle, and this is what makes it such a fascinating species.</p>",

Black-eared Sparrow-Larks are nomadic, wandering over the Karoo to follow recent rain, and as a result sometimes reach places well outside the usual distribution range. For example, in some years Black-eared Sparrow-Larks have been recorded in numbers in the Oudtshoorn district and in the Murraysburg district, both areas in which the birds are usually rare. A large number of Black-eared Sparrow-Larks appeared on our farm outside Prince Albert a few years ago, stayed for a few weeks and then departed without breeding or returning since then. The birds may have some movements not related to rainfall, and small numbers may be regularly recorded in some parts of the core distribution area.</p><p>The birds occur in sparse dwarf shrubland and grassland, almost always on red sands in the Kalahari, Bushmanland and the Namaqualand coastal plain, and on red sand patches in the Karoo. They also occur on poorly drained clays and stony soils in the Karoo, provided that there are some sandy patches supporting bushman grass Stipagrostis species. In the Kalahari the birds are often associated with Driedoring (Rhigozumtrichotomum) and Kraalbos (Galenia africana) patches on red sandstone or red Kalahari sands. Black-eared Sparrow-Larks may be locally common, even abundant when breeding, and are highly gregarious at all times – in small flocks when breeding – and at other times in very small to large flocks of up to several hundred birds.</p><p>The birds occur in sparse dwarf shrubland and grassland, almost always on red sands in the Kalahari, Bushmanland and the Namaqualand coastal plain, and on red sand patches in the Karoo.

The birds gather in large numbers in places where rain has fallen, and individuals stake out territories (and presumably, prospect for nest sites). At one such breeding event near Middelpos some years ago, nests of Black-eared Sparrow-Larks were interspersed between nests of Grey-backed Sparrow-Larks and Namaqua Sandgrouse, but the nests of all the species were spread over quite a large area, so very little interaction between individuals was seen. It was also too late in the breeding event to see many males displaying at that site.</p><p>Black-eared Sparrow-Lark males display with a butterfly-like flight with exaggerated beats of their broad wings, circling over the territory. The nest is built by the female – a cup of grass leaves, rootlets and feathery awns from bushman grass – placed in a hollow on a foundation of twigs. The nest rim is slightly raised and decorated with sandy webs of Buckspoor Spiders (Seothyra species). The nest site is at the base of a grass tuft, forb or shrub, and usually faces south or east. Incubation of the eggs and feeding of nestlings is shared equally by both sexes. Nestlings are fed invertebrates such as termites, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and no seeds. Like other larks and particularly sparrow-larks, the young leave the nest before they can fly and are led away from the nest area by their parents. If the nest is threatened the adults perform distraction displays, either fluttering or hovering over the nest giving alarm calls, or feigning injury by flopping to the ground and fluttering away, giving distressed-sounding calls.</p><p>The birds forage in flocks among sparse shrubs and stony patches, picking food items from the bases of plants or from bare ground. A wide range of seeds are eaten, mostly of grasses but also forb and shrub seeds, and small fruits such as those of the honey-thorn (Lycium species). Animal food includes termites, beetles, ants, and leaf-hoppers.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In 1936 E. Leonard Gill brought out his A First Guide to South African Birds, a forerunner of the modern day field guide. He had this to say about the Black Harrier: “Apparently nearing extinction. It is now only seen at all regularly in the dry country between Cape Town and Saldanha Bay.” Nearly 70 years later the situation was a bit more hopeful with an estimated 500 to 1 000 breeding pairs in total but the species is still classified as Near-threatened in South Africa. In the southern and south-western Western Cape, it is mostly found in strandveld and mountain fynbos and also in the ever-decreasing remnants of renosterveld. In the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Free State, where it is sparsely distributed, it is mainly confined to the high-lying grasslands. It is also found in the southern North West Province and central Mpumalanga with a resident population in north-western Namibia.</p><p>It is nowhere common and its numbers fluctuate annually in any one area. On the west coast of the Western and Northern Cape it can be present in some years when there is an abundance of rodents but it may be completely absent in the following year. Some, mainly the females, move out of the Western Cape in winter travelling as far as KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State. Veld that has been recently burnt is avoided but it may return a few years later if the vegetation has recovered sufficiently. Two nest sites in the south-western Cape that were used annually, Paarl Mountain Reserve and the Limietberg Nature Reserve, were deserted for several years after an intensive burn.</p><p>It is nowhere common and its numbers fluctuate annually in any one area.

Two nest sites in the south-western Cape that were used annually, Paarl Mountain Reserve and the Limietberg Nature Reserve, were deserted for several years after an intensive burn.</p><p>Like many harriers, it has a preference for small rodents and birds which it almost invariably takes on the wing – quartering the country at high speed just a few metres above the tops of the bushes. The birds make good use of any air movement so seldom flap their wings. When prey is spotted they twist and drop into the bush to snatch a rodent or bird. Perch hunting has rarely been observed. The Common Quail is a regular prey item, especially in mountainous regions. Less often it will take insects and amphibians.</p><p>Many of the harrier species of the world are known to congregate at over–night roosts, a phenomenon not known in the Black Harrier.  In April 2012, however, Western Cape birder Jessie Walton observed a roost of at least 30 Black Harriers on a grassy plain near Hankey in the Eastern Cape. On the three consecutive evenings that the roost was monitored, two African Marsh-Harriers joined the Black Harriers.</p><p>It is largely a solitary nester, but in marshy areas nests have been found less than 100 m apart. Nests are frequently in low dry fynbos, either on the ground, or very slightly raised. If available, sites on the edge of marshes or small streams are chosen. There is a strong tendency to nest-site fidelity, one site having been used for 25 years.</p><p>The Black Harrier is perhaps not ‘nearing extinction’ as Gill feared all those years ago but it does face a challenging future. In many places it relies on remnant patches of natural vegetation to survive, and in some areas this vegetation is being removed at a disturbing rate. For example on the coastal plain of the Overberg, the renosterveld, which is a good hunting and nesting habitat for the harrier, only survives in scattered islands of natural veld in a sea of cereal crops, and these patches are all too often degraded by overgrazing or the infiltration of alien vegetation. It regularly hunts over the belts of veld-lining roads.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Black-headed Heron could, at a glance, be mistaken for the similar-sized Grey Heron, especially when it is seen in flight; both are large herons, virtually alike in size, and both have mainly grey, black and white plumage. They differ in head and neck colouring and, in flight, their underwing colouring is obviously different (all-grey in Grey Heron and black-and-white in Black-headed Heron). Unlike the Grey Heron, the Black-headed Heron is confined to sub-Saharan Africa where it is generally a common bird and one of the most frequently encountered herons on the continent. In southern Africa it is absent only from arid areas and from extensive stretches of continuous woodland; it is non-migratory across its range.</p><p>Part of the reason for its ubiquity is that, unlike other heron species and with the exception of the Cattle Egret, it is a terrestrial hunter, feeding on a range of small animals, reptiles and insects that it can catch in the grass, in particular grasshoppers, beetles, lizards and small rodents. It is commonplace to see Black-headed Herons hunting in grassland far from water, and these birds are frequently to be found in farmlands, especially on ploughed fields and pastures, around stock pens and at feedlots. However, they do also hunt in wet areas, even wading at times.</p><p>Part of the reason for its ubiquity is that, unlike other heron species and with the exception of the Cattle Egret, it is a terrestrial hunter, feeding on a range of small animals, reptiles and insects that it can catch in the grass, in particular grasshoppers, beetles, lizards and small rodents.

However, they do also hunt in wet areas, even wading at times.</p><p>Its particular hunting technique is to walk slowly, pausing at intervals, then freezing while slowly extending head and neck forward, eye intently angled towards some potential victim ahead of it. A quick lunge follows and a food item is snatched from its hiding place. This is not to say that Black-headed Herons are never associated with water: they often nest and roost in trees or reed beds over water, and when grassy areas become temporarily flooded, numbers may gather to take the opportunity to exploit whatever incapacitated creatures may be stranded in the rising water.</p><p>Veld fires also provide a great attraction, and rising smoke is probably the signal that draws all the Black-headed Herons in the district to feast on the carnage wrought by the fire. I have a lasting memory of watching a dozen or more Black-headed Herons stalking doves that had gathered in their hundreds to feed on heaps of sorghum seed that were laid out to dry at a processing plant: in the space of a few hours a number of the less wary Laughing Doves in their midst were successfully stalked by the herons, impaled and swallowed whole, feathers and all. One bird was observed catching Laughing Doves coming to drink at a water hole in Etosha National Park.</p><p>While Black-headed Herons usually hunt solitarily, they invariably gather in numbers to breed. They may join other species at mixed-species heronries for this, but as often as not they breed in small monospecific colonies of their own, numbers ranging at these from a handful of pairs up to about fifty. Tall trees growing alongside farm buildings, or trees standing on an island or in water on a farm dam are much-favoured sites, and some are used year after year. One such site I know of, in a large old camel thorn, was already in use when I was a schoolboy, and it is still being used by these herons as a breeding site 50 years later.</p><p>Another contrast from others in the family is that Black-headed Herons do not develop ornate plumage at the onset of the breeding cycle and there are no major changes to the colour of legs, feet or bill at this time. But their grey, black and white plumage does acquire a crispness, their cere becomes a richer blue and the eye briefly becomes crimson, though by the time incubation is under way it has reverted to its usual yellow colour.</p>",

The birds are bright yellow with a black head and red bill, eyes and legs. The only bird with which they might be confused is the Masked Weaver, which occurs in a different habitat, is much smaller and has a conical horn-coloured or black bill, not a long pointed-tip bill.</p><p>The Black-headed Oriole is widespread from northern Namibia through northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, northern and eastern parts of South Africa right down to the Western Cape. It is interesting that within this distribution there are three different subspecies recognised. They are usually found in well-developed woodland, normally with closed canopy. However, it is often found in more open woodlands, and in the southern Cape it is more a forest bird. They are a very common garden bird throughout their range and, with their  attractive calls, are well known and well liked in southern Africa.</p><p>The Black-headed Oriole is widespread from northern Namibia through northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, northern and eastern parts of South Africa right down to the Western Cape.

They are a very common garden bird throughout their range and, with their  attractive calls, are well known and well liked in southern Africa.</p><p>The Black-headed Oriole is an insect eater but also eats a variety of other food, including fruit when it is available. I have watched one bashing a large hairy caterpillar against a branch until it was pulped enough to swallow. They are also regular visitors to flowering aloes and other flowering trees which provide nectar in flowers and which do not require a long, curved beak like the sunbird. They are particularly fond of the Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala because the nectar actually drips out of the end of the flower and is, therefore, readily accessible. In the brachystegia woodlands of Zimbabwe and the forest of the southern Cape they are regular members of the mixed bird parties which forage through these habitats, particularly in the non-breeding season.</p><p>I have been able to study this species extensively during its breeding in the brachystegia woodlands of Zimbabwe. It is interesting that it is one of the first insectivorous birds to start breeding, often as early as August but usually in early September. They build a hammock nest made almost entirely of strands of Old Man’s Beard Usnea species. At this time of the year the Usnea is very dry, but is still pliable.  However, it is rather like blotting paper in that if it gets wet it absorbs a lot of water and becomes quite heavy and very soft. It also becomes very weak, quite unlike the dry strands. In a number of years when we had early rains the birds would sit in the nest with the wings spread to keep the rain off the nest. Despite this the  nests became saturated with water and usually collapsed, or fell to pieces, thus depositing the eggs and/or chicks on the ground below.</p><p>It is conspicuous that the Black-headed Orioles normally finished their breeding cycle before the first heavy rains which fell in mid-November in most years. In fact in some years when the rains were late in arriving, the pair of orioles in our garden would even have a second brood. If they started nesting again in October we always knew that the first rains were not going to fall until some time in December. The chicks would be fed a variety of soft insects, including spiders, caterpillars and green grasshoppers. At no time did I record their bringing fruit to the chicks, but I am told they do so in the southern Cape.</p>",

It is a very dark slate-grey, almost black bird, with yellow feet being the only colourful part. These are often hidden because its preferred hunting method requires wading in water! Like many of the heron family, this species develops long breeding plumes on the nape and on the back. These are used in displays to the females. They are probably important in making the birds appear much larger than they actually are.</p><p>Although originally thought to be comparatively rare outside the Okavango, the Black Heron is actually now known to be quite widespread from northern Namibia, through northern and eastern Botswana and the whole of Zimbabwe, and much of the northern and north-eastern parts of South Africa and southern Mozambique. Like many of our waterbirds they are nomads which move around in response to water conditions. They are birds of open pans, usually with plenty of shallow water, where small fish and frogs may be found. At one time they were considered to be rare breeders in South Africa but further work has shown them to be regular breeders in a number of heronries such as those along the Nyl River. In the Okavango they are very common, and pans drying up there may have over 40 birds feeding in the shallow water. Birds along the upper Zambezi and Chobe Rivers have become habituated to the tourist boats plying the waterways, and will allow a close approach for photography.</p><p>Although originally thought to be comparatively rare outside the Okavango, the Black Heron is actually now known to be quite widespread from northern Namibia, through northern and eastern Botswana and the whole of Zimbabwe, and much of the northern and north-eastern parts of South Africa and southern Mozambique.

Observation in August at one of these heronries showed that they preferred to nest well below the canopy which was occupied by the larger herons and storks. Were it not for the fact that the Black Herons were flying in and out of the Swamp Fig island, one would never have known that they were there. The nests were comparatively simple platforms of sticks placed on forked branches about 1-2 metres above water level, well inside the edge of the island.</p><p>The Black Heron is unique in its ability to mantle its wings and form a canopy which shades the water under the canopy. This probably enables the bird to see any fish or tadpoles in the water because reflection from the sky is reduced or even eliminated.  The ability to do this is because the primaries and secondaries in the wing are much wider than those of other similar-sized birds so that when the bird spreads its wings out, there are no gaps between the wing feathers.</p><p>When the Black Heron is feeding it either forms the mantle, looks into the water for a few seconds and then closes the wings and moves to another spot; or, it will stand absolutely still for a minute or more with the mantle open, standing and waiting for fish and/or frogs to swim into the shade of the wings. The former method is probably more often used, especially along the edge of rivers and pans. However, the latter method can be extremely effective in pans which are not too large. It was used exclusively in a shallow pan which was drying up and in which there were lots of birds competing for fish! The birds often gather in small groups and move in unison through the shallow water, probably driving fish ahead of them until the fish swim back through the mantling birds and then get caught. The yellow feet may be shaken in the water to attract fish – it is interesting that the Little Egret also does this with its yellow feet.</p>",

The Black Kite occurs across much of the Palaearctic where it breeds, and these birds move south into Africa during the northern winter. Here they mingle with the African Milvus representative, the Yellow-billed Kite, and between the two there is ongoing confusion as to whether they comprise a single species or two, not to mention difficulties arising in distinguishing between the different age- and race-related plumages of each. Fortunately in southern Africa the situation is less complex than further north in Africa – here, both are summer visitors, one arriving and breeding, the other spending its time here as a non-breeding visitor.</p><p>Recent DNA evidence has indeed confirmed that Black and Yellow-billed Kites meet the requirements of being considered two distinct species, and the adult birds of each are quite distinctly different. The Black Kite is a little larger than the Yellow-billed; its bill is not all-yellow, but instead is all-black with a yellow cere; the head is not uniformly brown but is greyish, streaked with dark brown, and the tail is less deeply forked. The birds sometimes mingle in flocks, especially at termite alate hatches, and these differences in the individual birds can be readily seen. Immatures and subadults are another matter though, and are probably indistinguishable in the field as both have black bills, streaked heads and shallowly-forked tails.</p><p>Recent DNA evidence has indeed confirmed that Black and Yellow-billed Kites meet the requirements of being considered two distinct species, and the adult birds of each are quite distinctly different.

They usually occur in groups or flocks, unlike Yellow-billed Kites which, as breeding birds, are mostly found in pairs here, but they are nevertheless outnumbered by the breeding birds, by as much as 500:1 in some areas. They also arrive in the region a few months later than the Yellow-billed Kite, reaching southern Africa only in early October and departing again in March. Where they spend their time here is probably much dictated by where the rains occur, these rains triggering the emergence of vast numbers of termite alates, a major food source for both the kites and a variety of other migrant eagles. As rain fronts move, so do the attendant kites and other raptors. Because the Black and the Yellow-billed Kite have long been treated as races of the same species, relatively little attention has been given to the bird and its activities in the region.</p><p>By contrast, it is a well-studied bird in its northern breeding grounds which extend from south-western Europe eastwards to Siberia. Ringing results have shown that the bulk of Europe’s population (from Switzerland, Germany, France and elsewhere) moves to West Africa for the winter, crossing in large flocks into Africa at the Straits of Gibraltar. One particular bird whose movements were tracked by satellite over two years, spent about four and a half months based at its breeding site in Germany, five and a half months in West Africa, and a month commuting each way between Europe and Africa. During its time in West Africa this bird ranged widely, moving 30 kilometres or more daily and over more than 14 000 kilometres during its five months there. None have, as yet, been tracked to southern Africa but there is a record of a bird ringed in western Russia that was recovered in South Africa, so perhaps it is from this region that the local wintering population originates.</p>",

Only the south side had emergent vegetation, and within and around these patches Black-necked Grebes had started to build nests. On subsequent visits to the site we recorded birds incubating, and then birds with small and growing young, and then no birds at all – all had moved on. Nor have we seen any Black-necked Grebes again at this site.</p><p>This is a characteristic of the species – to rapidly colonise a ‘new’ flooded area, whether it be a dam that is usually shallow and that has filled with unseasonably good rains, or a grassland flooded to a metre or more by an extreme rain event. The colonisation of these newly flooded areas may be extremely rapid, and in one case a crashing thunder storm was followed the next day by the arrival of the Black-necked Grebes who immediately started building nests.</p><p>This is a characteristic of the species – to rapidly colonise a ‘new’ flooded area, whether it be a dam that is usually shallow and that has filled with unseasonably good rains, or a grassland flooded to a metre or more by an extreme rain event. The colonisation of these newly flooded areas may be extremely rapid, and in one case a crashing thunder storm was followed the next day by the arrival of the Black-necked Grebes who immediately started building nests.</p><p>Black-necked Grebes are probably not resident anywhere in southern Africa. They are nomadic in drier areas, breeding sporadically when environmental conditions are suitable, but they also have regular movements to wintering areas inshore on the Namibian coast, and to larger west coast rivers, such as the Berg river at Velddrif, where several hundred Black-necked Grebes were recorded in about September one year. The birds are usually seen in small groups or pairs when breeding, seldom in pairs or small groups when not breeding and more likely to be seen in large aggregations of 250 to 1 000 or more birds, sometimes associating with Little Grebes.</p><p>Black-necked Grebes are widely distributed in the world. They occur in Eurasia, North and South America and in Africa along the Mediterranean coast, and at scattered localities south of the Sahara and Sahel. In southern Africa, the birds are found mainly in the central plateau, and drier south-western and western areas, including Namibia. Their habitat is large pans and ephemeral water bodies inland, particularly, as noted above, those that fill rapidly, following heavy rainfall. The birds also occur on more permanent waters with some sparse emergent vegetation. Black-necked Grebes usually nest in loose colonies, seldom, if ever, nesting alone. Pair formation probably occurs only after a suitable nesting site has been found. The ritualised courtship displays that are such a feature of the grebe family are not well known in this species in southern Africa. In Europe the rituals are more or less the same as those of the Great Crested Grebe – ‘Threat displays’ to rivals, the ‘Ghostly penguin display’, the ‘Cat display’ and ‘Mutual penguin dance’, in which pairs rise out of the water, face to face. A further set of ritualised platform courtship displays is performed on nest platforms, of which several may be built. The nest is built by both sexes, a mound of algae and other soft water plants, anchored to underwater growth, with the nest cup barely above water level. Unlike other grebes, the eggs are not as diligently covered when the bird leaves the nest. The chicks leave the nest immediately after hatching and swim, or are carried on the backs of the parents, and fed by both parents. The breeding success is generally low in southern Africa with only about 5% of eggs producing young. Predation of eggs and chicks may be a factor, but strong winds and changes in water level also contribute to low breeding success.</p>",

Some authorities treat the two as conspecific. They are secretive and occur sparsely in Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, Mpumalanga, Swaziland, KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transkei in the Eastern Cape. Often overlooked, they can be mistaken for the more common Kurrichane Buttonquail, although they are more richly coloured. They prefer high-rainfall areas, particularly short, damp grasslands or soggy open woodland with grass tussocks. Their movements are not well known, but are thought to be nomadic or migratory, with numbers in southern Africa peaking in the summer rainy season. Usually encountered as individuals or pairs, they may form loose groups, which skulk within the vegetation and are reluctant to flush. When flushed, they fly fast for a short distance, without calling, showing their dark back and rump before dropping into cover, seldom to be flushed again. Their feeding behaviour is undescribed, but it is known that they eat small seeds and invertebrates. The eerie call is a somewhat flufftail-like series of low-pitched ‘hooo’ notes, with no pause between the notes, and quietest at the start and end of the sequence. They may be threatened by loss of habitat to commercial forestry, crop farming, overgrazing, too-frequent burning and human settlement.</p>",

In the southern Cape where they breed, they are often associated with banks in which the nests can be excavated, with the result that they quite often occur along river lines even in quite open country.</p><p>Typically the birds fly at no great height above the ground but where insects are rising they will follow them up to a considerable height. The flight is both fast and direct, or quite slow with much gliding, and the birds weave and jink around a lot as they chase insects. Although they are most often seen in pairs or small groups of up to four or five birds, they do occur in much larger groups. Over the open grasslands in the Botanic Gardens in George, I have watched flocks of twenty plus birds hunting insects disturbed by people walking across the mown grass. This is usually in the late summer when the birds are preparing to migrate northwards.</p><p>Most South African birds leave in about April or May and return again in August but in some areas birds have been recorded as overwintering in southern Africa. This is obviously dependent upon the presence of sufficient food for the birds to survive. It is thought that most of our birds probably go to coastal Mozambique which, with its subtropical climate, would have plenty of insects even in the winter.</p><p>Normally one pair excavates a single tunnel in a bank of limited size – the bank is probably only big enough for one pair. The site chosen is often under an overhang. However, I have observed that in a number of places two, three or even four pairs may nest in a single bank some four or five metres wide. Clearly, this is because the bank consists of friable sand which is easily excavated by a bird with a relatively weak beak. Suitable banks are often in short supply around George where I live! The birds make a very small tunnel about 35-40&#160;mm in diameter, which ends in quite a large nest chamber. A saucer-shaped nest of grass and lichen, including Usnea, is built in this chamber. These swallows have also been observed collecting the furry parts of some Protea flowers, probably for this purpose.</p><p>I watched a pair of Black Saw-Wing Swallows collecting strips of grass from the side of the road. The grass had been mown some time previously and was brown and dry. The stems were not collected but the leaves up to about fifteen centimetres long were being picked up by the birds and carried off to a nest hole in a bank created by the road builders. Such holes are subject to predation by snakes such as the Boomslang Dispholidus typus. Famed bird photographer Nico&#160;Myburgh was photographing the chicks in a nest when a Boomslang came in and ate them. He photographed that too, of course!</p>",

Its range extends northwards through sub-Saharan Africa and into some Mediterranean countries while a separate population is found in Indo-Malaysia. Three other closely related species occur elsewhere in the world, one in the Americas and two in Australia, and three of the four have at times been treated as a single near-cosmopolitan species.</p><p>All four are specialised predators of small rodents, and the hunting methods and predator-prey relationships in the southern African bird have been well researched. Ninety eight per cent of its recorded prey here comprises rodents of which just three species, all diurnal-living, the Angoni Vlei Rat (weighing, on average, 72 g), the Multimammate Mouse (26 g) and the Three-striped Mouse (25 g) make up the great bulk. A Black-shouldered Kite needs about 60 grams of prey a day, i.e. it needs to catch just one Vlei Rat, or two or three of the smaller species per day to survive, and this it does mainly by hunting them from perches that overlook areas of grass in which these mice live.</p><p>All four are specialised predators of small rodents, and the hunting methods and predator-prey relationships in the southern African bird have been well researched.

When hunting, the kite scans the ground below for movement, bobbing and weaving its head when prey is detected, before launching off and plunging to the ground with talons extended. Only one or two out of 10 such strikes prove to be successful and when they are, the kite quickly dispatches the victim on the ground before returning to a perch to eat it. The entrails are eviscerated and dropped to the ground, the head is dismembered and swallowed in a gulp and the rest is eaten piece by piece, the tail being the final morsel.</p><p>A kite’s day starts soon after sunrise when it leaves its roost and moves to its daytime hunting territory, an area that is vigorously defended against intrusion by other kites and is mostly where it has spent the previous days. After a bout of grooming, it starts taking an interest in the ground below it, and if nothing materialises it moves to a second hunting perch where the ground surveillance continues. About two hours a day, on average, is spent actively hunting, but this can reach seven or eight hours if things don’t go well. If a Vlei Rat is caught and eaten, the bird moves into the shade of a tree and remains there inactive for the rest of the day, whereas smaller prey items require the bird to get back on the beat after a rest period.</p><p>The second hunting method in the Black-shouldered Kite’s arsenal is to hover while scanning the ground for prey from a height of about 20-30 m. The technique uses more energy but gives the bird access to new hunting areas, and it also results in a higher success rate: this way 3-4 strikes per 10 dives are, on average, successful. Most hovering occurs later in the day, perhaps because these birds are hungry and need to make a plan to secure food before nightfall, but also because there is more often a breeze in the afternoon, and hovering in wind is less energetically costly than it is in still air; under some conditions they are able to hang in the air with wings almost motionless.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The genus Accipiter comprises the sparrowhawks and goshawks, names which are essentially interchangeable and owe their origins to usage in Britain where, with only two species, the large one was from, medieval times, called the goshawk and the small one the sparrowhawk. The large versus small distinction falls down in the wider world where 51 Accipiter species of all sizes are known, and the same applies in southern Africa where five occur. Here historical naming has resulted in our largest being called a sparrowhawk and one of the smallest being called a goshawk! Today the sparrowhawk-goshawk distinction is more focused on the relative leg and central toe length of a species, sparrowhawks being longer in this department than goshawks. To sidestep ambiguity, though, the scientific name ‘accipiter’ is generally used as shorthand for all members of the group.</p><p>Accipiters are characterised by having relatively broad, short wings, long tails and long legs and talons, and they are extremely agile hunters, quick off the mark, and given to pursuing their prey at speed through vegetation. The falconry fraternity refer to accipiters as ‘shortwings’ because of this, and they are favoured falconry birds, given their dashing hunting technique.</p><p>Accipiters are characterised by having relatively broad, short wings, long tails and long legs and talons, and they are extremely agile hunters, quick off the mark, and given to pursuing their prey at speed through vegetation. The falconry fraternity refer to accipiters as ‘shortwings’ because of this, and they are favoured falconry birds, given their dashing hunting technique.</p><p>The Black Sparrowhawk – Black Goshawk if you will – is the largest accipiter in Africa, nearly matching the European Goshawk in size and, as expected, it is much sought-after for falconry. In all the accipiters there is a substantial size difference between males and females; Black Sparrowhawk females, for example, weigh about 900 grams whereas males weigh about 540 grams, and this has consequences in what they hunt and how they catch it. Male Black Sparrowhawks hunt doves and pigeons mainly, birds weighing about 100-300 grams, and they pursue and overtake these in flight, whereas the large females prey particularly on gamebirds, from francolin and spurfowl to guineafowl, which are flushed from the ground and struck down in flight. There is of course overlap in the prey taken by each sex, and a much wider range of birds than those mentioned, and some mammals too, are caught.</p><p>Prevailing opinion on why reversed size dimorphism has evolved to such an extreme in accipiters relates to the breeding cycle and the roles of the sexes in it. Black Sparrowhawk females don’t hunt for themselves from before egg-laying through to when the chicks start growing feathers, and during this time they remain on or close to the nest where they are fed by the male. Their role is to guard the nest, incubate, and brood and feed the chicks, and their larger size has advantages here, from providing better protection, to being more able to withstand periods when food is not brought in. Small size in the male results in him being swifter and more nimble and, probably, a more efficient hunter, better equipped to provision the family. This, anyway, is the bones of the ‘fat female, agile male’ hypothesis.</p><p>Black Sparrowhawks breed earlier in the year than other accipiters, repairing their nest from about May onwards, laying mostly between July and September (but a few months earlier in winter rainfall regions), and fledging the brood between October and December. Their breeding habits differ in several respects from other accipiters. Firstly, their nest is substantially larger than those of other accipiters and it is reused annually. One nest was known to have been used for 32 years, and such nests can reach a metre in width and nearly the same in height. Secondly, these hawks maintain a lining of green leaves in the nest throughout the breeding cycle, a behaviour that resembles that of eagles. Unlike eagles, though, no cainism occurs in this or other accipiters, and broods of two, three or even four young are routinely raised.</p>",

They are known to eat a variety of fish, including different species of Catfish, Mudfish, Bream and even Tiger Fish where these are trapped in drying-up pools. In addition they, like most birds, will eat anything they can overpower, and they have been recorded as eating various frogs and toads and their tadpoles, small mammals, bird nestlings and small reptiles. They eat a variety of insects.</p><p>In the Karoo the birds will move up rivers when heavy rains cause the rivers to flood.  As the rivers dry out, however, the birds are forced to move back downstream and it is at this time that they may gather in large groups of up to twenty birds in estuaries such as the Kariega River in the Eastern Cape. In the southern Cape where rivers are perennial, they are seldom seen near the coast.</p><p>These birds are thought to pair for life but experience in Zimbabwe shows that if one of a pair dies, the remaining bird soon gets a new mate. The pair builds a large stick nest on a cliff or, in the case of Zimbabwe, on flat ledges in the balancing rocks which are so typical of the plateau country. At the beginning of the breeding season the pair often meets at the nest where courtship and pair bonding occur. The displays include head shaking, crouching and bill-clattering. A pair of Black Storks nested in a large cave on the side of a whaleback rock called Mutemwa near Marondera in Zimbabwe. This nest was occupied throughout the forty years that I lived in the area. The cave was inaccessible to baboons and other non-aerial predators. The birds were successful in rearing up to three chicks in years of good rainfall when the rivers had plenty of water and there was plenty of food available.</p><p>Although not considered to be a tree nester, some Black Storks do build nests in trees, and at least one pair has been reported as nesting on the top of a Hamerkop nest. The stick nest has a central basin that is usually lined with softer grass and other material.</p><p>Both the male and female incubate the eggs, which require about 35 days to hatch, the non-incubating bird going down to the water to hunt for food, and because the eggs are laid two or three days apart, they hatch asynchronously, and the chicks therefore grow into different sizes, some larger than the others. It is interesting that while helpless initially, by 25 days of age the chicks can move around but cannot stand. They are able to stand at about 45 days old, by which time they are growing feathers through the down. They will leave the nest after 60-70 days of being fed by the parents and will go down to the nearest river to feed with the adults.</p>",

Intensive ringing studies over the last 12 years have shown that Namibian birds are drawn from all populations, with two feeder prongs from Europe, one gathering on southward passage in the Netherlands and the other, drawn from more easterly populations, passing through the Mediterranean.

In the Bathurst District birds normally leave the area after breeding, returning only from March. However, the return may occur earlier when good rains have fallen. Where they go is not known but as arrival can be rapid after rain, they cannot have moved far. In the southern Cape birds tend to prefer longer grass to that favoured by the Crowned Lapwing, moving when the grass becomes too long.

In KwaZulu-Natal movement is altitudinal with birds spending the non-breeding season closer to the coast while Eastern Cape movements are poorly understood although it has been suggested that they are related to rainfall. In the Bathurst District birds normally leave the area after breeding, returning only from March. However, the return may occur earlier when good rains have fallen. Where they go is not known but as arrival can be rapid after rain, they cannot have moved far. In the southern Cape birds tend to prefer longer grass to that favoured by the Crowned Lapwing, moving when the grass becomes too long. As this is dairy country there are always pastures available where grass length suits their requirements, therefore they are generally fairly sedentary.</p><p>Although breeding solitarily the majority form loose colonies of several pairs and maintain territory only in the vicinity of the nest. Once the chicks have hatched the families may form loose assemblages, preferably feeding over the shortest grassveld. In the Port Alfred area they seemed to prefer short, natural grassveld totally ignoring areas of alien Kikuyu grass for breeding. The golf course was once favoured because of its mown fairways on natural grassveld but the pressure of more intensive golfing has now driven this colony from the area, and they are now found only on well-grazed cattle farms where indigenous grasses still exist. When breeding is completed different local populations often join to form flocks of up to 140 birds.</p><p>Once fully feathered the young are a very dull version of the adult, lacking the white on the forehead and having a poorly developed chest band. Adult plumage is only gained when they have completed their moult in their second year but still remains a slightly duller version of the adult. Sexual dimorphism is displayed by the adults, with the male having a much deeper blackish band across the chest and more white on the forehead, although this is not always a good characteristic as the white often becomes quite dirty and worn during feeding.</p><p>It is often thought that the Crowned Lapwing is the more dominant when the two species occur together but I have found the opposite. In the moister coastal grasslands the Black-winged is more at home and dominates the area while the Crowned is a fringe species here occurring mainly during drier periods. Both species show considerable aggression in the face of potential predators and can draw from members of their own kind from a sizeable area to harass raptors such as Yellow-billed Kite. When not breeding they may occur in mixed parties but usually when there are only one or two of either species. They do not join at nocturnal roost sites and form separate roosts, sometimes fairly close by but more often at some distance.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This pratincole closely resembles the Collared Pratincole, but tends to be found in larger flocks, seldom remaining in one area for long. They typically occur in drier habitats than Collared Pratincoles, although in Botswana they favour damp ground or newly flooded grassland and ploughed areas. As its Afrikaans name suggests, it is one of the ‘locust birds’ that used to exploit the huge Brown Locust swarms that were a feature of the Karoo and adjacent grasslands of southern Africa. Vast numbers of these birds would follow a swarm, hawking locusts on the wing but also catching them on foot when their prey is ground-based. It is quite a sight when a large flock is milling on the ground in apparent confusion.</p><p>Black-winged Pratincoles breed in the steppe zone from Romania and Crimea east to Kazakhstan, migrating south over the eastern Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula to winter in south-central Africa. They probably follow the Rift Valley before heading for western Zambia, where huge flocks have been seen over the Liuwa Plains. They reach their non-breeding quarters from the end of October, dispersing throughout Botswana and the northern part of South Africa south to the Free State, with lesser numbers in Namibia. In some years a few birds wander as far as the south and west coasts of South Africa. They depart in March, with a few stragglers remaining into April. It is assumed that most birds undertake the return movement in a single flight, but flocks are frequently observed on migration through western East Africa, and may stop off in this area to rest and feed.</p><p>Black-winged Pratincoles breed in the steppe zone from Romania and Crimea east to Kazakhstan, migrating south over the eastern Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula to winter in south-central Africa.

It is assumed that most birds undertake the return movement in a single flight, but flocks are frequently observed on migration through western East Africa, and may stop off in this area to rest and feed.</p><p>Black-winged Pratincoles are nomadic during their sojourn in southern Africa, occasionally gathering into huge concentrations. For example, one flock in the Free State in December 1991 was estimated at between 250&#160;000 and 800&#160;000 birds, probably the bulk of the world population. This total is much higher than the estimates of 15&#160;000 to 45&#160;000 pairs made across the birds’ breeding range in the mid-1990s. Such discrepancies show how difficult it is to make a complete count of breeding pratincoles. A recent estimate made on the breeding grounds in 2006 gave a more encouraging assessment of 152&#160;000 to 190&#160;000 birds. A similar picture emerged in Australia, the major wintering ground of the Oriental Pratincole G. maldivarum, when in one season an estimate of 2.5 to 3.0 million birds was made in Western Australia when the entire world population at that time was thought to be only 300&#160;000 birds.</p><p>But the fact remains that this pratincole is declining steadily through habitat destruction linked to agricultural intensification throughout their steppe breeding grounds. In the Caprivi Strip one of the major threats is high grazing pressure, while in the Okavango Basin the spraying for tsetse fly also has had an adverse effect. Being so highly nomadic on the breeding grounds should allow them to cope with changing conditions, but it does pose the risk of specific, point source threats affecting a large proportion of the population. Indiscriminate use of insecticides is particularly problematic, both through reducing their prey base and increasing the risk of accidental poisoning.</p>",

The total southern African population is now estimated at 15&#160;000 to 30&#160;000 birds. This bird in its various races has an extensive world distribution, occurring mostly south of the Tropic of Cancer through all continents other than Antarctica. Populations are variably resident to nomadic or migratory, with all of these movement categories applying to the stilts in southern Africa. In the past, the local birds have been considered as a separate race, meridionalis, but recent findings show limited difference between our birds and those occurring northwards to southern Europe.</p><p>For such conspicuous birds that breed in such exposed situations it is amazing that they are so successful. There is probably high egg and chick mortality but they appear to be able to re-lay quickly and, being opportunistic, can exploit a wide range of habitat types. Nests may be built on dry land or on mats of floating vegetation in shallow water, the latter often landing up on wet mud as the water recedes with the advancing dry season. In earlier days they most probably bred mainly on ephemeral and temporary wetlands but nowadays, because of human activities, a great variety of man-made wetlands are put to use. Some of these are particularly popular such as saltworks, sewage ponds and industrial effluent ponds. At the effluent ponds at Chegutu, Zimbabwe, birds breed in any month of the year and sometimes in numbers.</p><p>For such conspicuous birds that breed in such exposed situations it is amazing that they are so successful.

Numbers of breeding birds fluctuate considerably from year to year at any site and it is not known if some individuals are faithful to their breeding sites. However, this seems unlikely: colour-ringed birds in Zimbabwe were never seen to return to the same breeding site in later years. This is probably a legacy of times when habitats were rarely the same at any one site from year to year.</p><p>The eggs are similar to those of most of our local waders, with a pale buffy background variably marked with spots and streaks. The chicks are comical little birds and look so ungainly on their long stilt legs. However, try to catch them in marshy habitat and they can quickly disappear from view. This fooled me for a while until I discovered that they can hide underwater in much the same way as a jacana chick. Once they are almost fully grown they have a dusky grey appearance compared to their immaculate, black-and-white parents and often fool observers into thinking that they are Common Greenshanks, which have similarly coloured legs.</p><p>It is very difficult to determine the migratory component of a popu&#173;lation of birds when there are resident birds in the area. This is particularly true of the stilt. In a study at the Chegutu ponds in Zimbabwe, where some birds were always present throughout the year, numbers increased from February, peaking in late April / early May, and dropping off steadily to September when many suitable habitats for them would be exposed elsewhere. Some of the birds caught were carrying considerable accumulated fat, calculated to be enough to allow them to fly to Zambia, or, and possibly even the DRC or southern Tanzania.</p>",

Despite the apparent similarity of this species to the White-tailed Crested Flycatcher, the latter is in a quite different family, related to the Fairy Flycatcher. The family Monarchidae boasts more than 90 species of flycatchers, most of which occur in southern Asia, Australia and New Guinea, and various Pacific Islands eastwards as far as Hawaii.</p><p>The Blue-mantled Flycatcher is a bird of the forest interior. It does not normally frequent the dense vegetation of the forest fringe, but is found in very small forest patches and even breeds in such habitat fragments. It is commonly encountered in pairs, and often joins mixed-species foraging parties during the non-breeding season. Male and female are seldom very far apart, but they are small birds and not always easy to detect in the forest canopy. The easiest way to locate them is by their calls; their contact call (which functions also as an alarm call) is very similar to that of the Paradise Flycatcher, a raspy ‘zweet-zwaw’ or ‘zweet-zweet-zwaw’. The song is also similar to the Paradise Flycatcher song, a loud, whistled trill, staying at the same pitch, not descending slightly in pitch as does the song of the Paradise Flycatcher. They are active little birds, darting here and there, hawking minute flying insects and also gleaning twigs and foliage. One of their habits is to fan the tail, droop the wings, and often to sway from side to side. This behaviour is characteristic of both members of this genus, so they could be termed ‘fantail flycatchers’, which in fact is the meaning of their generic name Trochocercus.</p><p>The Blue-mantled Flycatcher is a bird of the forest interior.

Specimens of its sister species occurring in Equatorial Africa, the Blue-headed Crested Flycatcher Trochocercus nitens, were found to have eaten only insects, including a leaf-hopper (a Homoptera plant bug).</p><p>The nest is usually built at about 1.5 m above ground level in a forked twig of a sapling or shrub and is similar in terms of construction and material used to the nest of the Paradise Flycatcher. Like their relatives, the Blue-mantled Flycatchers can be quite confiding and tolerant of observers when nesting, at least until the young are ready to fledge, but they can be astonishingly bold and aggressive towards any real or potential predator.</p><p>I once came across a nest of one of these birds in riverine forest fringing the Pongolo River in northern Zululand. The nest was not sited in the usual forked twig but had been bound to the vertical stem of a small sapling. The structure was on the verge of total collapse and the solitary incumbent was clinging to the cup lining to keep from falling out. I decided to level the nest to make it more secure. The hen flycatcher had withdrawn inconspicuously, but her mate perched boldly within a metre of me, calling continuously and raising his crest. Then, as I started to realign the nest, he flew at me from behind, repeatedly striking my head and shoulders. Birds sometimes go to astonishing lengths to protect their young, but there are few small passerines that will actually press home an attack on a human intruder.</p>",

The species exhibits subtle sexual dimorphism in plumage.

This genus is now restricted to just five species, four of which occur in southern Africa. The sexes in Eupodotis bustards are similar in size and plumage. These bustards are monogamous, which is unique in the family, and they live permanently in tightly knit family groups, typically of about 3-5 birds in the Blue Bustard. These groups jointly defend fixed territories and are sedentary. Adult males actively assist in rearing the young, something unheard of in other bustards, and their group-living ways also stretch as far as co-operative breeding.

It inhabits the open grasslands of the highveld and it also ranges fairly far to the west into the grassland-Karoo transition, the ‘grassy Karoo’. It overlaps marginally with two of its congeners, the Karoo Bustard to the west and the White-bellied Bustard in the ranker, lower-lying grasslands to the east and north. It readily exploits the cultivated fields and pastures so characteristic of its mesic range, and this adaptability is likely the explanation for its survival in this otherwise highly transformed setting.</p><p>I once spent several enchanted days watching a group of Blue Bustards from a campsite on a low promontory in the scenic Lake Chrissie area of Mpumalanga Province. Their antics were both enthralling and endearing. The day would kick off with a bout of sustained and provocative ‘knock-me-down’ chorusing by all group members in response to similar vocalisations from surrounding groups. Soon the whole dawn landscape would reverberate with the deep guttural ‘toyi-toying’ of the species. When calling, all group members, including youngsters valiantly chipping in as best they could, raised their beaks to the sky, and their prominent black throat patches jutted out aggressively. Ludicrously, I soon learnt that Blue Bustards often mistake the sound of farm pickups clattering along rural roads for the call of their species and respond with vigour, setting off an expanding ripple of such calling from other groups that radiates outwards over the countryside like the waves created by a pebble thrown into a pond. This sometimes even occurred in the dead of night! Any excitement also seemed to trigger a displacement display in the dominant male towards the dominant female. In this display he would stalk her mercilessly, rapidly pumping his head up and down with his neck outstretched like the handle of an old-fashioned water pump. The rest of the day was spent in more mundane activities such as chasing down grasshoppers, stripping grass seeds, raiding the local farmer’s turnip field, needlessly harassing lapwings and larks, and endless preening.</p><p>On one scorching afternoon the dominant male stood at attention watching over his family lying prone in the heat. Both he and I were struggling to fight off drowsiness when suddenly an immature Martial Eagle swooped over him and only a last-minute desperate duck saved the day. As the frustrated eagle took up a perch on a nearby fence pole, and with all of us now wide awake, the male bustard marshalled his clan into a tight huddle and they hurriedly scuttled away.</p>",

The fact that a major part of their diet is comprised of dragonflies (among the fastest flying insects) bears testimony to their speed and manoeuvrability. It is breathtaking to watch one make a short, quick sally off a perch in pursuit of prey, and to return gracefully (often to the same perch) to bash the insect to pulp before swallowing it whole with a toss of the head! The chitinous exoskeletons are regurgitated later in the form of a compact, cylindrical ‘pellet’, the bee-eater’s way of getting rid of the indigestible food remains.</p><p>The Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters’ sojourn to southern Africa really is something of a vacation – it is a time for the birds to recover from the rigours of breeding in the Palaearctic. Food during the austral summer is abundant, and the bee-eaters rapidly gain weight and condition. They continue the post-nuptial moult that was started on the breeding grounds and temporarily suspended during migration. They have time for socialising, and particularly like to sunbathe together, either with mantle feathers raised, or with the head on one side, bill agape and eyes closed – sheer bliss! Because they are never far from water, they often plunge momentarily in typical bee-eater fashion to cool off, being quite capable of taking off again from the water’s surface. In March, prior to heading north once again, they undergo a period of hyperphagia (literally meaning ‘energetic eating’) to ensure that they will have sufficient fuel for the journey in the form of fat reserves. They will also have overhauled their flight apparatus (remiges and retrices) by completing the moult. As a prelude to their departure, they experience a ‘migratory restlessness’, probably triggered by changing day length, and start to congregate in larger flocks. During April, they may be heard flying high overhead, often in the company of European Bee-eaters, with their internal compasses set on north.</p><p>A year in the life of a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater is packed with activity and vitality. Their annual migration, which we tend to take for granted, is nothing short of incredible. A long-haul, human visitor travelling from Europe to southern Africa would step off the plane feeling utterly exhausted, yet these relatively small birds (an adult weighs a mere 50 grams) travel the same distance seemingly effortlessly, under their own power. The evolution of feathers has given birds like the Blue-cheeked Bee-eater the freedom to travel the globe.&#9;</p>",

As a result many people say that they are calling in the rains and heralding the start of the breeding season. Blue Cranes are monogamous and form strong pair bonds, retaining the same partners for many years and strengthening their bond through elaborate displays and unison calls. Standing side by side with their heads tilted backwards and their beaks pointing skywards, the pair gives a complex and coordinated series of vocalisations, during which the male slightly raises his wings above his back while the female keeps her wings folded.</p><p>Highly territorial when breeding, Blue Cranes warn off other cranes that happen too close, using a series of threat displays that include a ruffling of the feathers on the body, a stiff-legged walk, a deliberate pecking at the ground, and deliberate preening of the wings and body feathers. Seldom making much of a nest, besides an occasional base of mammal droppings or building a platform of vegetation when nesting in wetlands, Blue Cranes lay one or two (very rarely three) large, well-camouflaged brown and pinkish mottled eggs. Nest sites are in areas that have good visibility and are within chick-walking distance of water. Within 12 hours of the first chick hatching, the parents leave the nest with the chick(s) and walk in search of insects and seeds, seldom returning to the nest. Each night, the parents usually find a wetland or dam in which to roost, if there is one in the vicinity, often carefully guiding the chick to a safe and dry roosting site or island as it swims through the water.</p><p>Once the chick(s) can fly at around three months of age, the parents slowly begin socialising again, integrating the chick(s) into a flock. These flocks reach their maximum size in August-September, when most family groups have come together. Flocks often gather in agricultural lands where they feed on waste grains, seeds and insects, and can reach upwards of 2&#160;000 individuals. They also gather at Ostrich and sheep feedlots. The breeding pairs disperse from these flocks early in spring to return to their breeding territories for the next season. The juveniles remain in non-breeding groups, ‘dating’ several partners over the next few years before choosing a mate and developing a lasting pair bond.</p>",

They breed at only six island groups around the Southern Ocean, including South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands, and typically remain year-round in cold waters well south of southern Africa. There are a handful of vagrant records, but in 1984 large numbers were recorded off the Cape in July, together with exceptional numbers of Kerguelen Petrels. Several weeks later, many of these birds were wrecked along the coast from the Western Cape to KwaZulu-Natal, but it is clear that the storms that led to their demise in August did not drive them into the region in the first place. Interestingly, similar wrecks occurred at the same time in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, suggesting that a large-scale event in the Southern Ocean was responsible for the irruption. Blue Petrels are indiscriminate foragers, eating anything that they find, including insects blown out to sea, pumice and plastic litter. Virtually all birds contain some plastic. Populations on Marion Island have benefited from the removal of feral cats from the island, with breeding success more than doubling. The global population is more than a million pairs, and the species is not threatened.</p>",

During some ten years of birding for The Atlas of Southern African Birds, Blue Quail were recorded on only nine occasions and, when compiling this book during 2012, there were no records from South Africa for the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project started in July 2007.</p><p>Although closely related to Harlequin and Common Quails, their closest relative is the Blue-breasted Quail Coturnix chinensis of south-eastern Asia. Although the Blue-breasted Quail (also called Chinese Painted Quail) is a popular aviary bird in southern Africa, the likelihood of escapees surviving in the wild to breed with Blue Quails is slim.</p><p>Although closely related to Harlequin and Common Quails, their closest relative is the Blue-breasted Quail Coturnix chinensis of south-eastern Asia. Although the Blue-breasted Quail (also called Chinese Painted Quail) is a popular aviary bird in southern Africa, the likelihood of escapees surviving in the wild to breed with Blue Quails is slim.</p><p>The Blue Quail is found widely across Africa, from Sierra Leone and Mali, eastwards to Ethiopia and Kenya, and south to Zambia, Angola, Zimbabwe and eastern South Africa. In southern Africa, it is confined to the Mashonaland Plateau of north-eastern Zimbabwe and to southern Mozambique, north of a line between Manica and Beira, but is rare in both areas. Historically, it was fairly common in the south of southern Mozambique and was scarce in KwaZulu-Natal; in both these areas, however, it now occurs only as a rare vagrant, with occasional birds straggling as far west as the eastern regions of the Eastern Cape. Although there are occasional sightings during winter in Zimbabwe, usually following above-average summer rains, this species is largely a nomadic summer visitor to southern Africa. Birders lucky enough to glimpse this elusive species most often see it crossing a road or scampering along a path.</p><p>Blue Quails prefer dense, grassy watercourses and swamps, the edges of cultivated lands and rice paddies, usually occurring in wetter flooded grasslands and in more wooded areas than those favoured by Harlequin Quails. They are seldom as numerous as Common or Harlequin Quails at any one place. Being the most solitary of Africa’s quails, they are rarely seen in groups of more than a few individuals. Remaining within cover, they are particularly reluctant to flush and, like other quails, they fly direct and fast for a short distance (20 to 40 metres) when flushed. This wary quail is seen most often in the early mornings when they come out into the open to feed or, on farms, in patches of moist grassland that have escaped burning and grazing. The call is a piping, three-note whistle, ‘teee-ti-ti’, with the first note being the loudest. The flush call is also high-pitched and three-noted. They are generally much less vocal than the other two southern African quails.</p><p>Blue Quails eat the seeds of grasses and weeds, and some green plant parts, as well as invertebrates, including termites. The availability of these preferred food items is probably determined by rainfall, because considerable local movement of Blue Quails occurs in response to rainfall events. Prolonged droughts and degradation of wetlands may therefore play an important role in excluding this quail from southern African grasslands.</p><p>The breeding behaviour of Blue Quail is poorly known. Breeding in Zimbabwe and Mozambique takes place mostly during the late summer, with breeding records from December to April in South Africa. Both parents care for the chicks, and family groups stay together until the young can fly. Downy chicks can die in minutes if exposed to temperatures lower than 20ºC, making breeding success strongly weather-dependent.</p><p>The recent lack of sightings in KwaZulu-Natal and the inland areas of South Africa, coupled with the paucity of recent records from Zimbabwe and Mozambique is cause for concern, and might be associated with accelerating degradation of the region’s wetlands. The only modification to wetlands in our region that has favoured this species has been the establishment of rice paddies in Mozambique.</p>",

As well as forest edges, habitat also includes clearings adjacent to patches of dense tall bush on the sides of roads in quite intensively farmed areas. In Cabinda, north of the Congo River mouth, Blue-spotted Wood Doves were common along roads through secondary forest, where they foraged on the bare areas.

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Blue Swallow is a totally blue bird, unlike the other Hirundo swallows which have blue backs and pale underparts. The birds are about the same size as the common Barn Swallow, but the male’s thin blue tail streamers are much longer than the Barn Swallow’s and in fact are longer than the bird’s body. The female lacks these streamers. The plumage is an iridescent blue black which changes colour quite markedly as the direction of light falling on the bird changes. The female is perhaps slightly duller than the male.</p><p>The Blue Swallow occurs naturally in high rainfall areas of montane grassland with streams. In Zimbabwe many of the streams disappear into sinkholes, which provide nest sites. The swallows are usually seen flying back and forth in search of small aerial insects, sometimes called aerial plankton. They commonly fly at fairly high speed when hunting for food, but more slowly if flying into the wind. They often perch briefly, usually using the same perches time after time and favouring these because they are higher than the surrounding vegetation. While on the wing the birds often give a soft, wheezy ‘chip-chip’ contact call. During the breeding cycle the male has a song of five to eight notes which is repeated again and again.</p><p>The Blue Swallow occurs naturally in high rainfall areas of montane grassland with streams.

They are considered rare and threatened in South Africa with only approximately 100 breeding pairs left because of destruction of the rather specialised habitat needed to support breeding pairs. Many of the wet montane valleys which are where this species occurs, have been drained, or have been planted to alien trees for timber. Considerable effort is being made to protect the remaining habitat suitable for Blue Swallows. These birds require an overhang for the half-cup nest which is built of mud mixed with grass. It is interesting that in Mpumalanga 25 of 31 nests reported were in old mine workings, suggesting that the birds were prepared to adapt their nesting behaviour to man altering the habitat. However, in most areas the nests are built on natural banks or holes with an overhang and a clear flight path to the nest.&#160;</p><p>I got to know this species particularly well in the Nyanga highlands of eastern Zimbabwe where the birds were quite common. There was a pair which nested in a pothole right next to the school’s cottage, where we stayed when on holiday. The birds were relatively common there because the natural montane vegetation had not been disturbed as it was part of a nature reserve. Subsequently volunteer Pine trees started to grow, and this tended to reduce the swallow population until the trees were cut down and removed.</p><p>Sitting on the veranda we could watch the Blue Swallows flying back and forth across the valley in front of the cottage, hawking insects. These swallows only spent the summer in the area and migrated northwards into the tropics for our winter, which was far too cold to support insects on which the swallows fed.</p><p>When the swallows arrived in spring, they immediately returned to the previous season’s nest. If it was in good repair the birds would immediately refurbish the lining, and as soon as there was enough food available, they would start nesting. It was interesting that the nests in this part of Nyanga were often lined with white swans’ feathers. There were swans kept on the artificial lake at Troutbeck Hotel, some four kilometres from the nest at Peterhaven cottage, so the swallows obviously flew to the lake to collect these feathers. It is thought that white feathers help the birds to locate their nest in dark underground sites.</p><p>The female usually laid two eggs, and it was not uncommon for both chicks to fledge from the nest. However, it would seem that survival of the fledglings was not high, because the population has gradually decreased. The nest is a half bowl of mud pellets built on the vertical side of a sinkhole, if one is available. They also build on stream banks where there is a slight overhang, or on the sloping roof of an Aardvark burrow. The Nyanga birds also made extensive use of buildings, particularly small wooden buildings scattered across the farming landscape. One pair nested on the veranda at the Troutbeck Hotel where they were observed for many years at the same nest site. Provided the birds started nesting early enough, they usually produced a second clutch of eggs during late December or early January, and would successfully rear a second pair of chicks.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The high-pitched contact calls of these attractive little waxbills are a regular background sound in savannas and woodlands.  Population estimates suggest that there may be several million Blue Waxbills in southern Africa. Dependent on regular access to drinking water, most birds seem to be resident, and a high proportion of ringed birds are recovered close to their ringing site. Some individuals are recaptured repeatedly over three to five years, and the oldest known Blue Waxbill survived more than 11 years in the wild, a remarkable longevity for such a small bird. They often use their feet to hold down grass stems while feeding on the seeds, but unlike the whydahs, use their bills and not scratching movements of the feet when foraging on the ground. They also take insects, and I once watched a Blue Waxbill attack a large termite alate. The waxbill finally brought down the termite after biting pieces out of three of the insect’s four wings!</p><p>Blue Waxbills are monogamous, and probably have a long-term pair bond since pair formation may start while the birds are still in juvenile plumage, and regular greeting displays are seen when the members of a pair meet up after a separation, even outside the breeding season; they frequently perch and roost together, and also allopreen. In courtship the male approaches the female carrying a grass stem, and may fly in to start this display making a distinctive buzzing sound. It is not clear if this is a vocalisation, or mechanical sound produced by the wings. Holding the nesting material by the tip of the grass stem, the male will then perch, and bob up and down, singing throughout the display. If the female solicits copulation by tail quivering, the male delivers a series of rapid pecks to her back before mounting her.</p><p>Blue Waxbills are monogamous, and probably have a long-term pair bond since pair formation may start while the birds are still in juvenile plumage, and regular greeting displays are seen when the members of a pair meet up after a separation, even outside the breeding season; they frequently perch and roost together, and also allopreen.

Nests are also often close to wasp nests. It has been suggested that, rather than the wasps providing protection against predators, the presence of wasp nests indicates sites which are free of predatory ants, which threaten the young of both wasps and waxbills. One pair of Blue Waxbills was watched building a nest during the rains in Zimbabwe. Within days some wasps started their paper nest directly below the waxbill’s nest, suggesting that the wasps were seeking shelter from the rain. The waxbill certainly derived indirect protection from the wasps, which started quivering their wings if a hand came anywhere near the nest. The waxbill nest lasted right through the rains, and the wasps finished up with a large nest beneath it.</p><p>The male Blue Waxbill seems to select the nest site, usually in a bush or tree, about two metres above the ground. He also collects most of the nest material, although both male and female construct the nest, which comprises a ball of dry grass stems with a side entrance. This is then lined with feathers and grass seedheads, which both members of the pair may continue to bring during the incubation and nestling periods.  Occasionally the empty nest of a sunbird or weaver may be used and lined by Blue Waxbills. The pair also shares the tasks of incubation and feeding the young. Once the young waxbills fledge, they do not return to the nest, but they may perch clustered together, and still receive food from the adults for several days. This species is evidently an occasional host of the brood parasitic Shaft-tailed Whydah, since a female Blue Waxbill was seen feeding fledgling Shaft-tailed Whydahs.</p>",

Most intriguing is the isolated population of an estimated 400 birds on the steep slopes of the Chimanimani Mountains on the border of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, about 500 km north of the nearest birds in South Africa. It is fortunately adaptable enough to enter even well-wooded suburban gardens, like my own, though just to forage.</p><p>It is as vocal as the other bush-shrikes and draws one’s attention with much duetting from prominent perches. The ‘bok-ma-kie-rie’ call is usually described as a duet, but in my experience it is the male which utters this (and variations thereof), to which the distinctly smaller female responds (or sometimes leads) with three to seven repeated single or double notes. However, a well-versed pair will have an extensive repertoire which will probably include this as a duet. The drably-plumaged juveniles practising their calling produce an amusing jumble of notes.</p><p>It is as vocal as the other bush-shrikes and draws one’s attention with much duetting from prominent perches.

However, a well-versed pair will have an extensive repertoire which will probably include this as a duet. The drably-plumaged juveniles practising their calling produce an amusing jumble of notes.</p><p>Bokmakieries are strictly territorial and have been reported to ‘shadow-box’ their reflections in windows and mirrors. One bird, presumably a male, even attacked a twice life-size image painted onto a ceramic tile name board in front of a house. In repeated encounters the bird usually began by calling from on top of or near the board, then approached it in a threat posture and finally attacked the image, concentrating on the head and breast-band.</p><p>Bokmakieries mostly forage on the ground, taking insects, other invertebrates and small vertebrate prey, and can be attracted to bird feeders with mealworms and grated cheese. While berries and small drupes have been reported in its diet, the regular nipping off of pieces of the succulent leaves of Echeveria (from central and South America) in a pot in our garden seems irregular. More unusual was the active ‘anting’ seen by a female, using a 7 cm millipede. Holding the coiled millipede in her bill, she wiped it under her wings and up her flanks a few times, before flying off without it. The function of anting (also known as ‘anointing’) is still debated, but is likely to have something to do with plumage maintenance, especially when the animal used has defensive secretions which might be effective in controlling parasites, especially lice. The use of millipedes has been recorded before, but not in Africa; most of those used were ‘quinone millipedes’ which characteristically secrete benzoquinones from their segmental glands.</p><p>Both sexes build the nest and participate in incubation and brood-rearing; when the pair frequenting our garden starts incubating, the male and female visit separately (while its mate is on the nest) and, once they’ve started taking mealworms to their young, this continues for the first part of the nestling period. In one breeding attempt the female vanished towards the end of the nestling period; the male continued taking mealworms, was seen feeding a fledgling in the garden three weeks later and had three fledglings in tow a week after that. The corpse of the (ringed) female was later found flattened on the road past the house, probably a roadkill victim, a frequent cause of mortality for this bird.</p>",

As recently as 1970, bird books described it as an uncommon non-breeding summer migrant from the Palaearctic to the eastern parts of South Africa. A small number of northern birds do indeed supplement the breeding population in summer (birds tagged in Spain have been observed in the Great Karoo), but the breeding birds, conservatively estimated at 900 pairs, certainly outnumber these migrants.</p><p>The first confirmed breeding record was in 1973 at the Nieuwoudtville Gorge in the Calvinia district of the Northern Cape, where no less than four pairs were found nesting along a two-kilometre section of the river. Unlike their tree-breeding European counterparts, Booted Eagles in southern Africa almost invariably breed on cliffs, placing the nest at the base of a small tree, where it is seldom visible from below. Often it is only the smear of droppings that gives the site away. Of the 250 nest sites currently known, free-standing trees have been used in only five cases. The birds show remarkable fidelity to nest on cliffs, and one site has been in continuous use for at least 36 years. They are tolerant of conspecifics breeding in close proximity, and two pairs have successfully nested simultaneously on the same cliff using nests that were a mere 70 metres apart.</p><p>The first confirmed breeding record was in 1973 at the Nieuwoudtville Gorge in the Calvinia district of the Northern Cape, where no less than four pairs were found nesting along a two-kilometre section of the river.

It was always assumed that they left for warmer climes to avoid the cold southern winters. However, most pairs appear at their breeding sites in late July and early August, deep in the southern winter. Booted Eagles have even been seen displaying over a nest site at Red Stone Hills in the Little Karoo on a day of strong north-westerly winds and intermittent sleet showers. One can only speculate that by moving north into regions of clear skies they increase their chance of catching reptiles, which need the warmth of the sun to become active. Moving north may thus help the birds in attaining breeding condition.</p><p>A seemingly inevitable consequence of the ever-expanding agricultural sector is the removal of indigenous vegetation. This is almost invariably detrimental to overall bird diversity, but strangely enough, agriculture – at least in some areas – appears to have benefited Booted Eagles. The removal of indigenous vegetation and the planting of crops such as wheat and lucerne attract rodents, providing a more productive hunting habitat.</p><p>In support of this, in the Willowmore district of the Great Karoo, Booted Eagles seldom hunt over the dense natural thornveld, preferring instead the degraded and overgrazed sections of farms. They have also adapted to hunting over suburbia and, like Yellow-billed Kites, are regularly seen over Western Cape towns such as Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Somerset West where the ever-increasing pigeon populations seem to be the main attraction. Their main prey is birds (up to the size of a sandgrouse) and small rodents and reptiles. Some of their hunting techniques are impressive. One method is to stoop in a near-vertical dive onto prey, sometimes hitting the ground with an audible thump. One was seen to enter a Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo thicket at high speed and emerge carrying a mouse. Dropping tortoises onto rocks to break their shells is another, less common practice.</p>",

Fortunately the ranges of the two species do not overlap for the most part.&#160; Bradfield’s Hornbills are normally only found in woodlands which occur on the Kalahari sandveld, especially baikiaea woodlands. They may also be found in well-developed mopane woodland and it is also quite common in the mopane woodlands which have been trashed by elephants and consist of regenerating stumps 2-3 metres tall.&#160; Continued feeding by elephants on these coppicing stumps prevents the trees from growing any taller.</p><p>Within its chosen habitat, Bradfield’s Hornbill can be quite common, and in some areas there appear to be birds sitting on every second or third tree.&#160; However, in winter the birds often gather into large flocks and at that time, unless one comes across a flock, they can appear to be absent in the area.

The seal is made by the female, mixing bird faeces with pieces of insect and bark. Crushed millipedes brought by the male to the female are especially favoured for building the nest plug. I have only once seen this species at the nest, which was when the female had already departed from the nest and both members of the pair were busy feeding well-grown chicks. It was not possible to determine the number of chicks without opening the nest, but their demands certainly kept both parents very busy, running an almost non-stop shuttle service, with food held in the tip of the beak so that it could be pushed through the slit entrance into the nest.&#160;The chicks were big enough to poke the tip of their beaks out of the slit to take food directly from the beak of the adult.&#9;</p>",

It is largely resident, but with some movement to lower altitudes in winter and some nomadism: it tends to be common in a locality for a few weeks before moving on to a new food source. It is interesting that the subspecies occurring in the Western Cape is bigger and has a much larger and thicker bill than the subspecies found in Zimbabwe, linked presumably to differences in the food supply.</p><p>The Brimstone Canary could be confused with the male Yellow Canary in the south of the species’ range. Particularly on the southern coastal belt of the Western Cape the two species can be seen together, although generally the Yellow Canary is found in low scrub and the Brimstone Canary is largely confined to the taller vegetation in more mesic areas. At Red Stone Hills near Oudtshoorn birders are often surprised to see Brimstone Canaries in what appears to be typical Yellow Canary habitat. Fruit orchards along the streams and the alien poplar woods, so much part of the Little Karoo landscape, are the attraction: from these habitats the Brimstone Canaries at times fan out into the drier scrub.

In the Helderberg Nature Reserve near Somerset West they are often observed taking the seed capsules of Pelargonium spp. and fruits of the Wild Olive Olea europaea africana. In the nearby Elgin district, rows of fruiting Fire-thorn Pyracantha augustifolia shrubs are a great attraction in autumn, and at times one can see up to 30 Brimstone Canaries in close proximity feeding on the fruits. The berries of the alien Cherry-pies Lantana camara are another regular source of food.</p><p>In common with several other canary species, Brimstone Canaries sometimes nest in loose groups, with nests occasionally being built within 20 metres of one another. The male doesn’t contribute to the nest construction but often accompanies the female on her flights to and from the nest. The nest is not necessarily well hidden and can be constructed in loosely foliaged trees. Typically, a small tree is chosen for the nest, which is most often about three metres above the ground, exceptionally as high as six metres. In the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve small yellowwoods Podocarpus spp. are often used. A nest near Riversdale was lined with slivers of string and fragments of an old decaying rag. While incubating the female tends to sit tight and, from a nest in the Marloth Nature Reserve near Swellendam, a female dropped off the nest and performed an injury-feigning display flight. The male feeds the incubating female and she sometimes sings loudly from the nest when she detects his approach with food.</p><p>Until at least the late 1960s, this was a common garden bird in the Western Cape towns of Somerset West and Stellenbosch. In recent times, however, it has become infrequent in both places, probably because of housing expansion and the resulting loss of open land. The extensive and frequent fires on the surrounding mountains are also likely to have contributed to the population decrease. Local decreases aside, however, the Brimstone Canary has adapted well to alien vegetation, notably pine plantations, and it is not under threat.</p>",

With rich cinnamon plumage from head to rump, and a broad, bright yellow bill, it cannot be confused with any other roller in our area, but further north is sympatric with the slightly smaller, darker, forest-dwelling Blue-throated Roller E. gularis. The two species differ in habitat. Broad-billed Rollers occur in savanna woodland-forest mosaics, along the edges of gallery forest, clearings in forest and woodland, and other well-developed lowland woodlands. They also are present in climax Miombo woodlands, where there are some open spaces and isolated tall trees, and in open Lala Palm Hyphaene petersiana savanna.</p><p>The Broad-billed Roller is a migrant, and is one of several African species that have populations migrating north and south out of Equatorial wintering areas to breed. The distribution of the Broad-billed Roller is from West Africa (Senegambia) east to Ethiopia and southern Somalia, and from there south to coastal and central Angola, Zambia, Malawi and north-eastern southern Africa. Its range in southern Africa is mainly eastern, but birds occur as far west as north-western Botswana and the Zambezi Region in Namibia. Elsewhere in southern Africa they are present in most of Zimbabwe (with the exception of the Limpopo River basin), in Mozambique between the Zambezi River and the Save River, and in the lowlands of Limpopo Province, eastern Mpumalanga, Swaziland and extreme north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>The Broad-billed Roller is a migrant, and is one of several African species that have populations migrating north and south out of Equatorial wintering areas to breed.

Nest sites are usually reused in successive years. Vocal displays with rolling flight and aerial chasing in the potential nesting area are thought to be part of the courtship display, but pairs are often established before the birds arrive at the nesting area, and their displays may simply be to advertise an occupied territory. Broad-billed Rollers are quite common at Kangandala National Park in Angola, and are highly vocal in August, giving rolling flight displays, and prospecting for nest holes in the taller trees. Territories may be as large as 30 hectares, and are well defined and noisily defended. At Soyo, north-western Angola, Broad-billed Rollers nest in holes in both live and dead Lala Palms in October, with much smaller territories of only around 2 hectares, the close spacing of nests leading to considerable noisy interaction between territorial males.</p><p>Broad-billed Rollers are specialist predators of swarming ant or termite alates and other abundant insects. Almost all the prey taken is hawked, sometimes close to ground, but mainly above the canopy. If there is a large emergence or hatch of ant or termite alates – this usually in the late afternoon – the birds leave their territories and gather in flocks, with many hundreds of rollers rapidly assembling at the swarm of alates. They feed until nightfall. Although their food is mainly ant alates and termite alates, a wide range of other insects, including many species of beetles and bugs are eaten. However, terrestrial insects that are poor flyers, such as grasshoppers, bush-crickets, mantises and roaches found in Broad-billed Roller stomachs, suggest that the birds occasionally forage on the ground.</p><p>Nesting is timed to coincide with insect emergences after rains, but this does not always happen; the rains may be late or insufficient to trigger alate flights. In Zimbabwe they nest along with most of the miombo birds in September to December before the rains start and before termite alates appear. They feed on almost any flying insect, including carpenter bees and cicadas. Later in December they gather at alate emergences.&#9;</p>",

The tail has the feathers graduated at the end.</p><p>They have a slow, high-pitched metallic ‘twink, twink, twink’ call and during a display flight they have a loud ‘sweep, sweep’ call. The birds call to one another with a loud ‘jur-jur-jur’. They are only found in two parts of southern Africa, the first from KwaZulu-Natal northwards through Swaziland into Mpumalanga and south-eastern Limpopo. The second occurs in the highlands and the central plateau of Zimbabwe.   They are always found in rank grassland either along rivers or marshes. They occur in pairs and do not often appear above the grasses.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Bronze Mannikins are tiny birds, not particularly colourful (especially when young), and although the blackish-brown bibs of the adults contrast with their white underparts, these mannikins might be dismissed as uninteresting LBJs. Uninteresting? Not really. In their short lives Bronze Mannikins build scores of bedrooms, occasionally appropriate real estate for their own use, sport tongue rings to impress the opposite sex, and often arrange for armed response security agents to protect their nests!</p><p>Outside of the breeding season they are gregarious and are encountered in groups, and they enjoy touching each other when perched. If, for example, several of them alight on a fence wire, the outermost birds will often shuffle inwards, compacting the flock, sometimes to the point where an individual is forced to pop up out of the crush like a cork from a bottle. Late arrivals to the perch usually try to plonk themselves into the middle of the line rather than at one or other end where there actually is space to land. Flock sizes vary seasonally, but usually comprise some10-20 birds.</p><p>Outside of the breeding season they are gregarious and are encountered in groups, and they enjoy touching each other when perched.

Late arrivals to the perch usually try to plonk themselves into the middle of the line rather than at one or other end where there actually is space to land. Flock sizes vary seasonally, but usually comprise some10-20 birds.</p><p>Groups stay together round the clock, and although Bronze Mannikins may occasionally roost in foliage like many other birds, they prefer to sleep in an enclosed nest-like structure termed a dormitory. This is used for roosting by a family group, but defecation in the interior and general wear and tear of the structure sooner or later prompt the building of a new one. Dormitories built by the group are not used for breeding, and are generally thinner walled (200-400 grass pieces) than breeding nests (550-800 grass pieces) which are built only by a single breeding pair. A flock of two or more amalgamated family groups may have several dormitories at their disposal, but itinerant groups may build a new one every day.</p><p>The urge to sleep in an enclosed nest is obviously strong, because Bronze Mannikins have been observed occupying empty nests of some weavers such as the Red-headed Weaver Anaplectes rubriceps.</p><p>At the start of the local breeding season (which varies among regions), groups break up into pairs and commence nest-building. The male defends a spherical territory with a radius of about one metre, centred on the nest. The female incubates the 4-6 white eggs for about two weeks, and both parents feed the nestlings, which fledge 16-18 days after hatching. Bronze Mannikin chicks have palatal markings (often called ‘mouth spots’); these take the form of twin black crescents or horseshoe patterns above and below the pale tongue, itself encircled by a black ring. These markings persist into adulthood and evidently play a role in display, especially when birds sing.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of nesting by Bronze Mannikins is their tendency to build in proximity to the paper nests of Belanogaster hornets. The nests may be as much as one metre apart, but the association is too frequent to be considered coincidental. Nesting success of Bronze Mannikins can exceed 50%, which is high for such a small bird. One cannot say what proportion of their nest success is attributable to hornet nest proximity, though there is little doubt that the predatory aspirations of primates (including Homo sapiens) are likely abandoned after a few stings from angry hornets.</p><p>Bronze Mannikins do not live very long; few juveniles survive to adulthood, and few adults survive for more than three years. The grass seeds that these birds feed on are not always available throughout the year. For a small species such as this (average mass is about 10 grams), going without food for even a few days is not a survival option. Nevertheless, their populations thrive in many regions of Africa, and they are tolerant of human-disturbed areas, so they have the right formula for success.</p>",

If you are lucky, you may encounter one roosting quietly under the shade of a small tree or shrub during the day, but it is mostly seen at night, feeding along gravel roads passing through wooded areas. Other aspects of its biology are poorly known and few people have ever seen its nest.</p><p>Bronze-winged Coursers are widespread but sparsely distributed over much of sub-Saharan Africa in the southern Sahel zone from Senegal to Ethiopia, and from western Kenya southwards on a broad front to central Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal. There is a gap between the two populations described and each has been given subspecific status, but they are poorly differentiated and they are perhaps best treated as a monotypic species.</p><p>Bronze-winged Coursers are widespread but sparsely distributed over much of sub-Saharan Africa in the southern Sahel zone from Senegal to Ethiopia, and from western Kenya southwards on a broad front to central Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal. There is a gap between the two populations described and each has been given subspecific status, but they are poorly differentiated and they are perhaps best treated as a monotypic species.</p><p>The southern population is tentatively estimated at between 10&#160;000 and 30&#160;000 birds. It is unlikely that a more accurate population estimate will be reached, given its cryptic plumage, sparse distribution, and nocturnal and highly nomadic behaviour. Having travelled extensively on gravel roads at night in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana I have seen fewer than 100 birds, and in 35 years only ever caught 14 individuals and found one nest. Very occasionally loose aggregates of up to a dozen birds may be found in an area, but this is usually immediately before or during their migration.</p><p>Its breeding and non-breeding ranges as well as its seasonal movements are poorly known. In southern Africa, literature reports are conflicting concerning its status. It can be locally common, as indicated by the number of road kills at certain times of the year, but may also be erratic in occurrence at many localities. The situation was clarified to some extent during the first southern African bird atlas. It appeared that a resident popu&#173;lation, mainly in the south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe and north-east lowveld of South Africa, is supplemented during summer (November to May) presumably by mainly non-breeding birds from the migratory populations of Kenya, the Congo, Tanzania and Zambia. The terrestrial feeding coursers leave their breeding areas in central Africa when vegetation growth becomes too tall and thick, driving them to seek areas with sparser vegetation. Their arrival is barely evident in the atlas data, but their departure in May is conspicuous as they frequent roads with resultant casualties from fast-moving traffic.</p><p>They arrive later in Namibia and southern Botswana, corresponding with the later rainy season there, and possibly pushed into the drier west by vegetation growth in the north-east of southern Africa. At this time, some birds wander as far as the south coast. In western Botswana some birds overwinter in years following good summer rains. At least one ringing recovery supports the migration, with a bird ringed in northern KwaZulu-Natal in early April recovered in eastern Zambia in October.</p><p>They are often seen in pairs year-round, and thus may retain the same partner for successive years. Although the usual clutch size is two eggs, they are one of the few coursers to regularly lay three-egg clutches. The nest is usually a simple scrape, but sometimes the birds build a small ring of mud or twigs around the nest, and exceptionally may raise the entire nest when threatened by floodwaters. The nest site is usually in the open, often on recently burned ground, but fairly close to cover. When disturbed, the incubating parent sneaks off the nest and seeks shelter in the nearby cover.</p>",

The throat is a light cream colour and the breast and belly are very light brown, with some streaking.</p><p>The Bronzy Sunbird is quite common in parts of the Bvumba and Nyanga highlands and has become a common garden bird in the gardens of the Bvumba. In the gardens the birds often nest in shrubs and bushes right up against the house, possibly to get some protection from the Samango monkeys which are the main predator of nests in this area. These sunbirds make extensive use of the prickly Tibouchina bushes for breeding. Tibouchina elegans has gone ‘feral’ and grows extensively in non-forest areas in the Bvumba. It is used by a number of species like the Bronzy Sunbird and Cape Batis for nesting because it is such a prickly bush and discourages small predators such as mice.</p><p>Bronzy Sunbirds are quite noisy birds and the loud two note call, ‘chee-wit’, may be heard throughout the day. They also have a more musical piping call which can be heard throughout the year but is used most extensively in early summer when they are breeding. Their extremely loud alarm call alerts one to the presence of potential predators.</p><p>While photographing these birds at the nest it was noticeable that the female did most of the feeding while the male only came in every now and again to feed the chicks. He was also very swift in coming in, feeding and then departing again. However, he was always nearby and quick to give an alarm call if someone approached the nest.</p><p>The nest is a typical sunbird’s nest made of vegetation such as grass and small roots which are bound together with spider web. The entrance is on the side, at the top, and there is a small ‘porch’ above the entrance which may serve the purpose of diverting water which collected at the top of the nest, from the entrance hole. We found that the nests were usually placed in prickly bushes about 1.5 to 3 metres above the ground.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>On my first visit to the Save River lowveld in what was then Southern Rhodesia, I was greeted by a chorus of loud whistling calls. All around me were rufous-winged birds flying up and then gliding down, giving a series of 10-20 descending whistles which were being answered by another bird in the thickets below. The male Brown-crowned Tchagras were displaying and giving their distinctive call which various authors have translated as ‘chi-chi-chi-chi-cheeyu-cheeyu-chooyu’ or ‘tttr-tttr-tttr-trteu-treu-treeeuu-treeeuu’ or even ‘pa-reeu, pa-reeu, pa-reeu...’. The female was responding from the bush below with a nasal ‘chreeu-chreeu’. It was spring and the first rains had fallen, causing a hatching of insects, and the Brown-crowned Tchagras were setting up territory prior to nesting. Considering that this species is usually secretive and is difficult to see, this outburst showed just how common the species was in the Zimbabwe lowveld!</p><p>The birds are quite similar to the Black-crowned Tchagra but have a brown head with a very thin black line above the white eyebrow. They also have a black line starting at the bill and running back through the eye. Their wings appear paler rufous than the former species, but this is only really noticeable when one sees both species together. Their underparts appear darker grey and they are noticeably smaller than the Black-crowned species. They have conspicuous white spots at the end of the tail feathers.</p><p>The birds are quite similar to the Black-crowned Tchagra but have a brown head with a very thin black line above the white eyebrow.

It is more widespread in the drier areas of Namibia, Botswana and the Northern Cape. It prefers thickets in bush and woodland, and may also occur in forest edges. They will occupy gallery woodlands leading through drier areas. They are generally much shyer birds than the Black-crowned Tchagra and spend much of their time within the thickets where they are very easily overlooked unless one is watching for them.&#160;Their call is not nearly as loud and conspicuous as that of the Black-crowned Tchagra but when displaying the male has a fairly loud whistling call given as it descends, with fifteen to twenty whistles, which are loudest in the middle. The female may join in duet with the male at this time but she is probably more circumspect about being seen than is the male!</p><p>The Brown-crowned Tchagra feeds on the ground searching for insects, including grasshoppers and caterpillars, beetles and their larvae.&#160;The birds seldom leave the cover of the bushes where they live, although I have observed them on the lawn at a farmhouse. In their natural environment they are best described as skulking and are seldom observed. They have been seen pulling praying mantis egg cases to pieces, presumably to get at the eggs or young inside the case. They have also been recorded as feeding on small lizards and geckos.</p><p>They breed in spring and summer. The nest construction is shared by the breeding pair. They build a shallow thin-walled basin of fine material, mixed at times with some coarser grass. It is all held together by spider web. The nest is usually very well hidden in the thickest bush in their territory. Two or three brown-speckled white eggs form a clutch. The female apparently does all the incubation and is fed on the nest by the male. Initially the small chicks are brooded by the female who feeds them insects brought to the nest by the male. Both birds feed the chicks once they have enough feather cover to be left without the protective warmth of the brooding adult.</p>",

Comparatively little is known of its natural history, however, as it is a small, unobtrusive and (most of the time) silent species that is either seldom observed, or, when seen, mistaken for one of the small flycatchers (Dusky or Spotted), which it resembles in size and general colouration.</p><p>Habits attracting observer attention include an erratic display flight, during which loud ‘tseet’ notes are uttered and an insect-like ‘dzeeee’ call. The display flight is undertaken at considerable height and usually (but not always) involves a pair of birds, zigzagging in pursuit. The ‘dzeeee’ call, on the other hand, is uttered from a song post, often a bare branch at the top of a tall tree.</p><p>Habits attracting observer attention include an erratic display flight, during which loud ‘tseet’ notes are uttered and an insect-like ‘dzeeee’ call.

The ‘dzeeee’ call, on the other hand, is uttered from a song post, often a bare branch at the top of a tall tree.</p><p>When not involved in aerial display, Brown-backed Honeybirds are usually encountered as solitary individuals foraging in trees and shrubs, or seen in dipping flight from one tree to another, with widespread tail showing the prominent white outer tail feathers. Perched birds sometimes ‘bob’ their heads – the bobbing being more of a circular movement than a simple up-and-down motion.</p><p>When feeding, Brown-backed Honeybirds tend to perch and scan the surrounding foliage, rather than clambering about among foliage and closely examining the upper- and undersides of leaves. Its diet consists largely of insects. Small beetles and caterpillars are taken opportunistically, but the main prey items are plant bugs such as aphids, especially woolly aphids, and scale insects. The scale insects provide wax, a substance that all honeyguides actively seek and that only they and their kin can actually digest and therefore use as food. Wax has been found in the stomachs of several Brown-backed Honeybirds collected in various parts of eastern and southern Africa, but it has not been possible to determine whether the source of the wax was from scale insects or from honeycomb.</p><p>Their penchant for scale insects has encouraged these honeybirds to frequent commercial plantations. I have also seen a Brown-backed Honeybird in the Little Karoo, displaying above extensive renosterveld. Renosterbos Elytropappus rhinocerotis is prone to infestation by a coccid bug, which is likely to be attractive to the bird and may have aided its expansion into the winter rainfall region of the Western Cape in recent decades. Within their normal range they are not known to be entirely absent during any period of the year.</p><p>Like others of their family, the honeybirds are brood parasites. They parasitise hole-nesting birds such as the Yellow-throated Petronia, or birds with enclosed nests with side entrances, such as those of cisticolas and other warblers. &#9;</p>",

It lacks the reddish rump of other firefinches in our region, and exhibits little sexual dimorphism in plumage; the dull reddish wash on the face of the male is only slightly reduced in the female. Pairs or small groups may associate with other waxbills, feeding mainly on the ground on small grass seeds.  Brown Firefinches also take some insects and drink regularly, often visiting garden birdbaths.</p><p>When breeding, Brown Firefinches are monogamous, defending a small territory around the nest. In courtship the male carries a feather or grass stalk, bobbing in front of the female while singing. Finally he approaches close enough to peck her on the nape of the neck, and if she responds by quivering her tail, mating will follow.  The nest is a ball of grass with a side entrance, placed in a shrub or tree, sometimes in the thatched roof of a building. It is later lined with feathers and grass seedheads, which may protrude from the entrance. Although these firefinches often build their own nests, they also frequently take over the nests of sunbirds or weavers such as the Southern Brown-throated Weaver, Golden Weaver, Spectacled Weaver, Village Weaver or Thick-billed Weaver. These nests are also lined with feathers and grass heads. In captivity Brown Firefinches are reputed to harass other aviary birds until they abandon their nests, so they practice eviction rather than passive occupation.

        "Body_Content": "<p>This parrot is a ‘Plain Jane’ in an otherwise flamboyant family. The meagre ‘bling’ it does proffer, brilliant-lemon underwing coverts, is usually discreetly concealed, as reflected in its scientific name, ‘hidden yellow’. It can be confused with Meyer’s Parrot, some of which lack a yellow crown patch, including the juveniles that also have reduced yellow on the shoulders and legs as well as greenish upper wings. Key points are that Brown-headed Parrots have pale lower mandibles, the yellow on the underwing extends to the body, and adults have pale greenish-yellow eyes (dark in the juveniles of both species). Adding to confusion, some aberrant Brown-headed Parrots show yellow on the shoulders. Brown-headed and Meyer’s parrots, however, barely overlap, and the former replaces the latter in coastal lowland savanna.</p><p>Like Meyer’s Parrot, this species is an opportunistic generalist, shamelessly deserting the dwindling supplies from one food tree as those from another proliferate. The primary vegetable diet is seeds, fruit, flowers and Acacia pods. Stuart Taylor found that in the Kruger Park, fare from some 23 trees was used, with the widest variety exploited in winter. Particular favourites included Long-tail Cassia Cassia abbreviata, Natal Mahogany Trichilia emetica, Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis, Sycamore Fig Ficus sycomorus, False Marula Lannea schweinfurthii, White Kirkia Kirkia acuminata, Red Thorn Acacia gerrardii, Bushveld Cherry Mystroxylon aethiopicum, Common Coral Tree Erythrina lysistemon, Pod Mahogany Afzelia quanzensis and four bushwillow Combretum species. At a site in Mozambique, the seeds of Saligna Gum Eucalyptus grandis were commonly on the menu. Most foraging occurs in trees, although these parrots are enticed to ground level by the large fruits of the Black Monkey Orange Strychnos madagascariensis that have been torn open by Vervet Monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops. Coral-tree flowers are squeezed in the bill for nectar. Crops such as cassava, maize and millet are raided. Like Meyer’s Parrot, it also feeds on the larvae of Lepidoptera, and it also seems to strip Acacia thorns for ants or other small insects. Remarkable concentrations of up to 200 birds can congregate at suitable feeding localities.</p><p>Like Meyer’s Parrot, this species is an opportunistic generalist, shamelessly deserting the dwindling supplies from one food tree as those from another proliferate.

Remarkable concentrations of up to 200 birds can congregate at suitable feeding localities.</p><p>Brown-headed Parrots are as noisy as their kin, and Taylor describes seven adult vocalisations. These include alarm and two different chipping contact calls, and ‘kreek’, ‘chreeo’ and ‘zzweet’ calls, the last of which is the most characteristic vocalisation. They also indulge in quiet ‘conversational chattering’, much of which may involve mimicry.  This chattering occurs whether the bird is alone or with others.</p><p>As with most parrots, the species probably forms life-long pair bonds. Like Meyer’s Parrot, breeding occurs late autumn to winter. Nests are in natural cavities or woodpecker holes. The female alone incubates, provisioned by the male. Based largely on observations of captive birds, only the male feeds the chicks directly, both while they are in the nest and after fledging. The female regurgitates food to him for him in turn to regurgitate to the young, after he has completed feeding them with his own contribution. A telling example of the intense competition for cavities by hole nesters is an observation of  Bush Squirrels Paraxerus cepapi carrying nesting material into a Brown-headed Parrot nest within 20 minutes of the fledglings departing. Linked to this pressure, young are taken directly to ‘nursery areas’ for a couple of weeks immediately after leaving the nest, where they remain while the adults are away foraging. These sites are characterised by densely foliaged trees and ready access to water, and are simultaneously used by up to five breeding pairs. There is indication that young individually recognise their parents based on vocalisations where there is the potential for confusion. Young achieve full independence less than two months after fledging, in contrast to young Meyer’s Parrots which apparently can burden their parents until the following breeding season.</p><p>&#160;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Brown-hooded Kingfisher is one of five local kingfisher species which rarely or never eat fish. It is found over much of the eastern half of southern Africa, extending westwards through the lowlands of the Western Cape to the Overberg, and is also found in the southern Karoo. This medium-sized kingfisher is one of the least colourful in the subregion. However, during the breeding season the male’s brownish red beak becomes a much brighter red.</p><p>It is well known because of its habit of frequenting gardens, even in densely settled urban areas, where suitable food and a nest site are available. The primary factor limiting its urban colonisation would appear to be food. However, it also requires the presence of suitable banks in which to excavate a nest. In this respect, pairs are fairly catholic, even excavating their tunnels in the sides of compost pits. One of the interesting features of these urban kingfishers is that they make extensive use of swimming pools for bathing. A bird dives, or perhaps better described as belly-flops, into the water and then immediately takes off again. It flies off to a perch where it preens and shakes itself. This process may be repeated over and over until the bird has cleaned itself or got rid of mites picked up in the nest.</p><p>It is well known because of its habit of frequenting gardens, even in densely settled urban areas, where suitable food and a nest site are available.

This process may be repeated over and over until the bird has cleaned itself or got rid of mites picked up in the nest.</p><p>The Brown-hooded Kingfisher is a fairly noisy bird which draws attention to itself by its loud ‘whistling’ call which can be heard from a considerable distance, especially when the bird is excited. It is interesting that this species has much less blue-green than most of our other kingfishers, and its display is also less distinctive and noisy. Its blue colouration is restricted to parts of the primaries, rump and tail, and is not nearly as bright as that of the other dryland kingfishers. When displaying, pair members both give loud trilling calls in unison, while opening their wings and bowing to one another.</p><p>They are still-hunters – a bird sits on a perch from which it watches the ground below. When prey is spotted it flies down and pounces onto it. This species has the distinction of being one of very few bird species which is able to eat ‘shongololos’ (giant millipedes), this despite the ‘shongololo’s’ yellow excretion and efforts to roll up in a tight ring. However, the normal food of this species is mainly invertebrates – including scorpions – but also small reptiles and young birds, if it finds their nest. It has even been recorded as catching small adult birds, including waxbills.</p><p>This species nests in a hole in a sandy bank – some of the other insectivorous kingfishers nest in holes in trees. The pair excavates a tunnel about a metre long and then forms a roughly circular chamber at the end with a hollow in the centre, in which 2-5 pure white eggs are laid. When fresh, the eggs are translucent and the yolk can be clearly seen. They become dirty with age. The eggs hatch after approximately 14 days, after which both adults, but mostly the female, run a food-delivery service for probably between three and four weeks until the chicks leave the nest. When feeding chicks, the birds bring in large numbers of grasshoppers from which the hard, rear, kicking legs have been removed. As is normal with kingfishers, prey is carried head outermost on the way to the nest. When older, chicks back up to the nest entrance to defecate. Apart from these efforts by the chicks to keep the nest clean, I have never observed the adults removing anything from the nest, so presume that the indigestible parts of their prey accumulate on the floor of the nest chamber.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In Natal Birds, published in 1899, the Woodward brothers called this bird the Brown Chat Thrush and wrote: “It is a retiring bird, and frequents the darkest and most secluded spots. It is very quiet, and only utters a kind of cackle when surprised.” Subsequent accounts also mentioned its retiring nature and its preference for the darkest and densest depths of its forest haunts. It certainly is a retiring bird, and one that is easily missed by moving observers. If flushed, it often flies up to a low perch, two to three metres high, and sits there silently, unseen by the intruder, or it glides into the cover of thick undergrowth, allowing only a glimpse of its white tail feather tips.</p><p>The best way to find Brown Scrub-Robins is to employ the sit-and-wait technique. A damp-soiled gully or seepage line with scattered thickets of undergrowth and carpets of leaf litter is a good place to sit quietly.&#160; Alternatively, one can go for a walk along a forest track during the first or last 20 minutes of daylight, and if Brown Scrub-Robins are present, one or more of them may be seen running along the track foraging.</p><p>The best way to find Brown Scrub-Robins is to employ the sit-and-wait technique.

The alarm note of all other Brown Scrub-Robin populations is a squeaky, skizzing call ‘zeeet-zeeetzeeetzeeet-zeeet’.&#160; It is loud and persistent if there are fledged young nearby. This call is also used more quietly as a contact call and sometimes as a precursor to song. The Zululand coastal population utters a rather soft, drawn-out ‘skizzzzzzzz’, not repeated as separate ‘zeeet’ notes.</p><p>The Brown Scrub-Robin’s song is a series of high-pitched, melodious phrases of five to eight syllables, each starting on the same opening note: ‘Hee – choy, choy, choy, choy’ or ‘Hee – toy, toy, tiddle, eechee’. The song of the Zululand subspecies has fewer syllables and is sometimes preceded with the ‘skizzzz’ call; e.g. ‘skizzz-yoo-weee’ may be repeated several times before the introduction of longer phrases such as ‘yoo weee toy-toy-toy weeep’. The song can be heard at dawn throughout the year, though most consistently in September to December and April to May. While singing, a bird will fan and slightly raise its tail whilst simultaneously partially spreading and lowering its wings, but it does not otherwise display the exaggerated tail movements of scrub-robins.</p><p>The Brown Scrub-Robin is silent when foraging. It whisks leaves to left and right to expose the humus, pecks a shallow hole and makes further quick pecks to capture exposed prey, after which it moves on with quick hops and repeats the procedure. It has an unusual habit of ‘marking time’, pattering leaf litter with one foot, then the other; this habit perhaps disturbs hidden invertebrates. It frequently associates with working mole rats whose mound-building activities flush prey from beneath the leaf litter. Occasionally it forages above ground level in vine tangles, and it sometimes takes small berries or drupes, though not as commonly as do robin-chats. After foraging, it often ascends to a low perch, wipes both sides of its beak, and preens. They bathe regularly, using rainwater puddles when available or resort to early-morning bathing in dew-wetted foliage.</p><p>The nest is usually sited in a hollow stump or rot hole, and the birds become extremely wary and unhelpful to the would-be observer and nest finder.</p>",

Another feature of this bird is the very large bright yellow eyes which are clearly visible in the round, light brown face. The tail has very clear light brown bands on a darker brown base. In flight the underwing coverts are plain brown and contrast strongly with the lighter coloured flight feathers. Like all snake eagles the lower legs and feet are bare of feathers.</p><p>The Brown Snake Eagle is widespread over much of the northern half of southern Africa but is absent from southern Namibia, the northern Cape and Karoo southwards, although they may appear further south than is normal. These may be juveniles dispersing after fledging. Interestingly, it has recently been recorded in the south-western Cape. Although locally common it is often overlooked because it sits on a perch and still-hunts by watching the ground below. Unlike the Black-chested Snake Eagle, it does not hover in the wind, although I have on occasions seen them attempting to hang in an updraft amongst the granite domes around Marondera.</p><p>The Brown Snake Eagle is widespread over much of the northern half of southern Africa but is absent from southern Namibia, the northern Cape and Karoo southwards, although they may appear further south than is normal.

Unlike the Black-chested Snake Eagle, it does not hover in the wind, although I have on occasions seen them attempting to hang in an updraft amongst the granite domes around Marondera.</p><p>Although this species was present throughout the year in Marondera, the fact that its numbers increased during the winter when prey visibility was better because the trees had fewer leaves, suggests some movement into the central plateau. The numbers in Namibia fall at this time of the year, and it is possible that the Namibian birds move eastwards during the winter. The records of birds in the south-western Cape are normally in summer, suggesting that these are migrants to the area. The birds are more or less restricted to wooded areas because of the need for perches from which to hunt.</p><p>Most hunting takes place from a perch but sometimes the birds soar overhead and then drop down in a series of steps to the ground to catch prey spotted while soaring. These birds are primarily snake eaters and it is interesting that they have been recorded as eating large Puffadders and even Black Mambas. Other snake species taken include cobras, boomslangs and mole snakes. They apparently even attempt to catch small pythons.</p><p>Their nest is built in a leafy tree and is often very difficult to spot. Several nests I found in Marondera were placed some distance from the top of a tree on a horizontal fork, usually near the edge of a large tree. One nest in a eucalypt tree seemed to be precariously placed on a small fork, but it successfully survived a number of summer thunderstorms with high winds. The nests appear small relative to the size of the eagle and because they were made of thin sticks, seldom survived into the following year. However, at least two pairs rebuilt a nest on the same fork, from which a chick had successfully fledged the previous year.</p><p>The birds mainly breed during the summer months, with most records in February/March when the birds are feeding chicks and are seen going to the nest, but a few nests have been recorded in late winter when one would expect the number of snakes available would be considerably reduced because of the cold. For those interested in details of the breeding and growth of Brown Snake Eagle chicks, read Peter Steyn’s description in his book Eagle Days, where he recounts a very detailed study of this species. It is a fascinating description of the life of a snake eagle.</p>",

It occurs across much of India through to Myanmar, with further isolated populations in southern China and on the islands of Taiwan and the north Philippines. Throughout its range it varies from sedentary to migratory, although it is unlikely that migration in southern Africa is particularly extensive.</p><p>In southern Africa it is most widespread and common in South Africa.

However, concentrations of up to 1&#160;000 birds have been found at a sewage works in Harare in the summer months: they may come from the Zambezi Valley and lowveld rivers to concentrate at these sites where food is abundant. Also of interest in the Harare area is that there is a winter influx of birds which are larger and a far higher proportion of the brown-bellied morph.</p><p>Breeding colonies tend to be small, varying from a single pair to groups of 6-12 pairs, although much larger numbers may be scattered along rivers where there are extensive river banks with suitable soft or friable soil for this small bird (normally less than 15 g) to excavate nest burrows. On the Zambezi River, the colonies are usually in the newer, less consolidated river banks rather than the old, harder alluviums where bee-eaters and kingfishers nest. This species breeds in any month of the year, this applying especially to the birds in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>Returning to Zimbabwe, at the two major sewage works in the Harare area this species tends to concentrate at one while the Palaearctic-breeding Sand Martins concentrate at the other. These two species also segregate at roosts in the same sites. The Eurasian birds prefer the company of other swallow species, especially the ubiquitous Barn Swallow. By contrast, Brown-throated Martins tend to roost in single-species aggregations in reed beds at nearby Lake Chivero.</p><p>When watching mixed-species feeding flocks of swallows it is often difficult to separate the different species: this is especially true where Sand Martins and Brown-throated Martins forage together. The most important feature to watch for, especially when a bird is flying away, is the upperpart colouration. In the Brown-throated Martin the wings tend to be much darker and contrast quite strongly with the paler back: this contrast is poor in its Eurasian counterpart.</p>",

The bird is quite small with the male having a black crown and back and the female having a brown crown and back. Both birds have a certain amount of rufous on the underparts. The female is somewhat less rufous than the male. One of the features of this species is a number of white lines extending across the bird’s head and back which help to break up the outline of the bird but also help with their identification when seen in the field. They have a conspicuously hooked tip to the bill.</p><p>The Brubru is very widespread and common over about the northern two thirds of southern Africa. Within this area it can be found in just about every sort of woodland and even in isolated patches of trees in otherwise open dry country. It is probably most common in well-developed woodlands where there is plenty of cover and insects on which it can feed. The call is a very high-pitched ‘bruuuuu’. The call lasts for about a second and is repeated over and over, sometimes many times before a break is taken. The male is usually sitting near the top of a tree inside the canopy where he cannot be seen and because of his small size, it is difficult to locate the caller.</p><p>The Brubru is very widespread and common over about the northern two thirds of southern Africa.

However, the fact that most bird parties in the brachystegia woodlands have more than two brubrus in it, suggests that there are also a number of birds which are floaters and do not have a fixed territory. The birds spend most of their time in the canopy foraging for insects and unless they are calling, are very easily overlooked. They are probably more conspicuous when part of a bird party. Food is found by gleaning along thin branches and particularly in the leafy part of the canopy, often from the underside of leaves when the bird reaches round to get at prey from a nearby branch.&#160;&#160;</p><p>They breed in spring in the woodlands and build a nest which looks very much like those of some of the flycatchers and the hyliotas that nest in the same woodlands. The nest is usually placed in the fork or on a large branch of a tree. The fork chosen has branches about the same diameter as the nest which thus melds with the branch! It is a cup-shaped nest of quite modest size which, in the brachystegia woodlands on the Zimbabwean plateau, is very carefully covered with lichen to make it match the lichen-covered branches on either side of the nest. Unless the bird is on the nest it is almost invisible! One nest we found in Gosho Park was in a leafy Musasa Brachystegia spiciformis tree. The nest became very visible because caterpillars ate practically all the leaves off the tree, leaving the tree almost bare, resulting in the brubru sitting on the nest being very conspicuous. We erected a hide near the nest despite the fact that the bird was still sitting on eggs, and the protection afforded by the hide meant that the bird and the nest were no longer so visible to a predator in nearby trees.&#160; Certainly the birds successfully fledged two chicks from the nest, despite the fact that the female was comparatively shy and often allowed the male to do the bulk of the feeding.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This rare Nearctic vagrant superficially resembles a small female Ruff, but has shorter legs and a shorter, straighter bill. It breeds in dry tundra of the high Arctic from central Alaska to north of Hudson Bay in Canada, with a small relict population in Chukotka, Siberia. It winters in the pampas of southern South America, south to about the latitude of Cape Town. Vagrants reach Western Europe in fair numbers each autumn, most of which are young of the year. Few have been found in the Afrotropics, and only a small fraction of birds are recorded on northward passage through Europe, suggesting a poor survival rate for these individuals. It is a rare vagrant to southern Africa. Records from coastal sites in Namibia and the Western Cape might be trans-Atlantic vagrants, whereas records from Gauteng, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and the Eastern Cape may derive from Asia. The population was greatly reduced by hunting in the early 1900s, and has failed to recover since then. Current estimates suggest that its numbers continue to decrease, with perhaps as few as 20 000 birds, and it is listed as Near-threatened globally.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The difficulties of identifying pipits in the field is nowhere better exemplified than when it comes to Buffy and Plain-backed Pipits. Sometimes nicknamed the ‘troublesome twins’ these virtually identical species have caused many birders, perhaps sensibly, to admit defeat. Successful separation of these two species, both of which have unmarked upperparts, rests on careful observation of their relative sizes, shape and posture, behaviour, subtle colour differences, and the colour of the base of their lower mandibles. However, all of these characteristics are fraught with pitfalls; in the last-mentioned, the hue of the bill base is influenced by the bird’s blood circulation – hence, all museum specimens have dull horn-coloured bills.</p><p>Identification challenges aside, Buffy Pipits are interesting and entertaining birds. The species was first described by Captain George E. Shelley (1840-1910), a nephew of the rather better-known poet of the same name, based on a specimen collected at Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal. The scientific name is derived from the Vaal River, but applies equally well to its dull, sandy brown colour. The Buffy Pipit occurs throughout much of southern Africa; however, it is absent from most of the Western and Northern Cape, the more arid parts of Namibia, the high mountains of Lesotho and the subtropical flats of Mozambique. It is present in both the grassland and savanna biomes, but is distinctly more common in the latter, where it reaches its highest densities in Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa’s Limpopo and North West provinces.</p><p>Identification challenges aside, Buffy Pipits are interesting and entertaining birds.

It is present in both the grassland and savanna biomes, but is distinctly more common in the latter, where it reaches its highest densities in Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa’s Limpopo and North West provinces.</p><p>Buffy Pipits prefer flat or gently sloping terrain with short to medium-height grass, bare soil and scattered perches in the form of rocks, termite mounds, shrubs or fence posts. It is often common in areas with an abundance of animals, partly because trampling and grazing keep the grass short but also because the animal dung attracts a multitude of insects. Historically, this species was probably associated with large herds of wild ungulates, but it seems to find modern animal husbandry practices, combined with agricultural activities, equally beneficial. It is present in Highveld grasslands, on grassy Karoo plains, in open savanna and woodland clearings, around rural villages, on ploughed and fallow agricultural fields, on airstrips, along gravel roads and in recently burned grassland.</p><p>While foraging, the Buffy Pipit exhibits exaggerated and energetic tail wagging. The reasons why pipits, and a plethora of other species, wag their tails are unclear; tail wagging might convey signals to their own species or potential predators or might help to startle insect prey from hiding, due to the sudden movement and associated shadows and contrasts. Buffy Pipits’ diet includes insects (especially beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, ants and termites), spiders, millipedes, centipedes, other small invertebrates and some seed; feathers and soil are probably accidentally ingested but may help in food digestion.</p><p>Eight subspecies of the Buffy Pipit have been described, four of which occur in southern Africa. Although a proportion of the population is resident, many of the respective subspecies are thought to undergo significant nomadic or migratory movements, the extent and details of which are under investigation. It is also suspected that some of the subspecies from central Africa may migrate to southern Africa in the dry season.</p><p>Buffy Pipits are not particularly vocal birds – in the sixth edition of Roberts’ Birds of Southern Africa, the song was still noted as ‘un-described’. During the breeding season males utter simple, chirping, sparrow-like phrases, very similar to those of other large pipits. When flushed, both sexes also give a short flight call. The nest consists of a sizeable grass cup that is placed in a recess against a grass tuft or is partly concealed underneath a rock.</p>",

It sounds like no other bird, and locals will give you all sorts of explanations for the origins of the noise. These will vary from the spirits of the dead, to a crested cobra or some other fantastic mythical beast. The sound is a pure low-pitched ‘hoooo’, each hoot drawn out over four or five seconds, repeated about four times per minute and possibly continuing for hours at a time. The purity and evenness of the call causes it to be likened to a tuning fork.</p><p>Locating the source of the call is where the fun comes in – if you choose to take up that challenge. The birds call from thick bush which is difficult to penetrate – the noise of forcing your way through causes the bird to stop calling! But it will start again if you wait. The bird apparently turns its head as it calls so it is very difficult to pinpoint the source of the sound. The bird will be sitting head height in a thicket. When you get too close the bird flies off with a clatter of wings on the vegetation, quickly dropping to the ground and scurrying away. Wait for better light – they call all day if it is overcast or drizzling.</p><p>Locating the source of the call is where the fun comes in – if you choose to take up that challenge.

Our family was taking an afternoon stroll down a Bvumba forest path, nine-year-old girls singing and giggling followed by younger brother swinging and whooping from every monkey rope. This was too much for a flufftail sitting on a nest a mere metre off the path. He jumped out into the path, scuttled away and off into cover on the other side. “STOP – SSHUSH.” Father takes control and the kids know he means business. In no time the bird comes out of the cover and begins walking back up the path towards us. “Look Dad,” says son, “he’s wagging his tail like a dog”, which is just what he was doing. It was the male that had been flushed off the nest and he was wagging his tail, not up and down like other crakes and moorhens, but from side to side. He soon moved back into cover on the nest side of the path and was left to his own devices.</p><p>These are not marshland birds. Further north, water-covered forest floor is occupied by the beautiful White-spotted Flufftail but our birds keep to drier ground, and for some years now they have taken to living in the bigger gardens of the out-of-town and up-the-hills suburbs of Durban. They are common breeding residents of George, Wilderness and Knysna in the southern Cape. Even Harare now has records of a pair nesting in one of the older suburbs. Though they may be resident in some parts they do move out when conditions get too dry; the young birds leave their homes within two months of hatching and wanderers arrive at many unexpected places, even the Orange River mouth.</p>",

The original description, by Temminck in 1829, was based on a specimen from somewhere in the Eastern Cape. Temminck considered it most likely related to the stonechats, and so he placed it in the genus Saxicola. Like many other 19th-century generic names, however, this was dropped. Later knowledge seemed to indicate that the bird was more akin to ant chats than to stonechats, so it was placed in the genus Myrmecocichla. There it stayed until the editors of Birds of Africa stirred things up by putting it back among the stonechats. It spent a brief period as a wheatear in the genus Oenanthe, but the latest genetic evidence suggests that it is best placed in its own genus, although it is most closely related to the Tractrac, Karoo and Sickle-winged Chats (which are separate from the other Cercomela chats), and closer to Oenanthe than Saxicola.</p><p>There is still debate over the closest relatives of this bird.

The beige and black patterning of the male’s plumage stands out, and although the female is cryptically coloured, the species’ habit of perching on rocks and boulders in open grassland makes it easy to find. Its common call note is best described as a clicking ‘chak’, and both sexes have a whistled song, interspersed with ‘chak’ notes and imitations of other birds’ calls. These calls can be heard at most times of the year, but most frequently during the spring breeding season.</p><p>Its foraging habits and diet have been well studied in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg foothill country by Alan Tye. His observations, made during the non-breeding season, revealed that Buff-streaked Chats spent over 70% of their time foraging and 20% resting, that their preferred perching heights ranged from 1.5 to 3 metres in 50 cm-high grass, and that their foraging techniques are basically of the ‘sit-and-wait’ type. The methods used depended to a large extent on the type of prey, and included ‘dash-and-jab’ (running along a rock surface to peck at prey seen from a perch), flying to the ground to catch prey seen from the perch, and hawking of flying insects. A fourth method, restricted to the proximity of woody vegetation (such as Protea trees), involved gleaning prey from the trunk or stem.</p><p>Prey included beetles, ants (mainly alates), grasshoppers, termite alates (when available) and spiders. Buff-streaked Chats appear to be particularly adept at catching grasshoppers after they have jumped and are in flight. Of interest is the fact that they spend 70% of their day foraging, whereas the Ground Woodpecker in the same habitat spends only 30% of its day foraging. The woodpecker feeds on nutritious ant brood taken from beneath sun-warmed stones, a food source not available to the chat, but the latter does well when there is an emergence of termite alates, which the woodpeckers do not eat.</p><p>It is possible that the Buff-streaked Chat once extended over the Witwatersrand region prior to urban development; it is also absent from the Magaliesberg range, despite the presence of suitable habitat. Significant portions of the grassland biome have been destroyed by commercial afforestation with alien pines and eucalypts over recent decades. If this trend continues, many Buff-streaked Chat populations will be at risk.&#9;</p>",

It lacks the streaking and white eyebrow stripe of the closely related White-browed Coucal.

They are not always popular garden birds because of their habit of eating small birds and nestlings, and indeed even birds’ eggs. The fact that they often eat garden snails is definitely in their favour, however, because the garden snail is an introduced species which has few predators.</p><p>Burchell’s Coucal is extremely well known because it has become such a common garden bird.

The fact that they often eat garden snails is definitely in their favour, however, because the garden snail is an introduced species which has few predators.</p><p>Burchell’s Coucal produces one of the characteristic sounds of Africa. Its loud, bubbling call starts by descending and then gradually ascending, and is given individually or in duet. It is sometimes described as similar to the sound of water being poured out of a bottle. The call is often associated with rain or when barometric pressure is falling before the rain arrives. For this reason the bird has become known as the ‘rain bird’. However, if one checks their calling regime and relates it to rainfall, their predictions of rain are no better or worse than those of the weather services!  The birds call most often in the morning and evening but at certain times of the year they can be heard throughout the day.</p><p>Burchell’s Coucal is fairly common to common in suitable habitat and in certain areas has become very common indeed. However, during dry years, especially if there is water rationing in force, numbers in urban areas decrease noticeably, probably in accordance with reduced food availability. They feed on snails in gardens, but mean death to the chameleons in our gardens in George.</p><p>The male builds a large, basin-shaped nest in a thick bush, a dense tree or a tree covered with creepers. Most nests are within two metres above the ground, but they have been recorded up to 10 metres high. Although the nest itself is well concealed, the coming and going of the adults soon gives its position away once there are chicks to be fed. Like other coucals, the incubation of the eggs starts as soon as the first egg is laid, resulting in chicks of different sizes in the nest. This may provide some insurance for rearing at least one chick if food supplies start to fail during the chick-rearing period. The chicks are rather ugly, having almost bare black skin with sparse, wiry, white feathering over the head and back. They are capable of ejecting very smelly faeces if approached, which is quite difficult to wash off one’s hand. This provides some protection from predators such as feral cats!&#9;</p>",

It is generally nomadic, although there may be seasonal, possibly irruptive, movements southwards and eastwards. It is not a common bird and generally poorly known. Two closely related species occur further north in Africa, the most widespread being the Cream-coloured Courser Cursorius cursor which has a rather discontinuous distribution from north, north-east and Sahelian Africa through the Middle East to Pakistan. These birds may winter close to the breeding grounds or move south to the sub-Sahara, Arabia and north-west India. The Somali Courser is a resident species found in the Horn of Africa from Ethiopia south to northern Kenya. This bird was long treated as a subspecies of the Cream-coloured Courser.</p><p>Occasional movements of the Burchell’s Courser into Botswana have been recorded as far north-east as the Makgadikgadi Pan but it is not thought to be resident in any areas in that country.

There has been an apparent decline of the population, especially in the eastern race rufus which is confined to South Africa. The causes for this decline are not known but are probably related to more intensive agricultural practices and the use of pesticides.

It also occurs locally in recently ploughed fields. It is monogamous and a solitary nester, breeding in most months, but mainly in the dry season before the rains, from August to December. The one or two eggs are laid on bare, open ground and while incubation proceeds various small objects may be added to the nest and its vicinity to break up the outline of the eggs. Eggs are usually laid post-rains in the north-west but pre-rains further south, becoming later in the south and east. Once breeding is finished they occur in pairs and family parties, but also form larger groups of up to 15, and loose flocks of up to 30 have been recorded.</p><p>Living in such arid areas its plumage has poor water repellence, and a bird caught in western Botswana during a thunderstorm was so saturated that it was only after drying it out in a cotton bag that I was able to identify it. It was then that one of the most important identification criteria, for separating it from the Temminck’s Courser, became obvious; that of the trailing white edge to the secondary feathers of the wing. These birds are very well camouflaged in their favoured habitat and are normally only located when they move.

In southern African, they are found mostly on red Kalahari sands with dry savanna or scattered scrub, or shrubs and shortish grass tufts.</p><p>Although largely sedentary, they may be locally nomadic in response to the availability of seeds. They are conspicuous at favoured water holes two to three hours after sunrise. Flocks may accompany flocks of Namaqua Sandgrouse, and sometimes also Yellow-throated Sandgrouse to water holes in the morning, avoiding those containing brackish water. However, they usually arrive at the watering site up to an hour later than the early-morning flurry of Namaqua Sandgrouse. Unlike Namaqua Sandgrouse, which land some distance from the water to check that the coast is clear of predators, Burchell’s Sandgrouse prefer to land close to the water’s edge or even directly in the shallow water. They are wary of aerial attacks by raptors, especially Lanner Falcons, drinking rapidly and leaving the water hole without further delay. They drink by dipping their bill into the water, taking a couple of sips and then tilting their head back to swallow. This is done five to ten times in rapid succession before leaving.</p><p>They are secretive and camouflaged away from water holes, crouching before flushing at close distance when disturbed, or running hunched and fast on their relatively long legs. They congregate in separate feeding groups from other sandgrouse although their diet is similar, consisting of the small, dry seeds of legumes, with a preference in the Kalahari for sandaarbossie and red pea. They like to feed in grassy areas with well-drained, sandy soils, whereas Namaqua Sandgrouse prefer more open, flat and rocky areas.</p><p>They are monogamous, solitary nesters which breed during the dry season, between April and October. The nest is a simple scrape in the sand, usually next to a grass tuft or shrub. The incubation period is unknown but incubation duties are shared, with the more camouflaged female incubating by day and the male taking over at night. When incubating in scorching desert heat, they can endure air temperatures of up to 50°C and sand temperatures in excess of 70°C. Under these conditions, the birds pant by vibrating the skin of their throat to aid heat loss by evaporating water. The tiny chicks are solely dependent on the adults for shade. Perhaps the most fascinating behaviour is that chicks are dependent on the adult male for water, which he carries from a water hole in his specially adapted breast and belly feathers.</p><p>Because of the remoteness of much of their range, they are relatively safe from most agricultural threats and have benefited from livestock watering troughs far from natural water holes: these allow them to feed further afield than before. On the downside, however, they are killed incidentally during Namaqua Sandgrouse hunts. These hunts take place in the winter, the breeding season for Burchell’s Sandgrouse. The loss of breeding adults to wing shooting can substantially increase the mortality of eggs and flightless chicks because both parents perform roles essential to successful hatching and chick rearing. Fortunately, because they favour different habitats to Namaqua Sandgrouse, they can be excluded from sites where Namaqua Sandgrouse are regularly hunted, by providing watering sites within their favoured habitats. &#9;</p>",

However, Burchell’s Starling is a larger bird with a shorter, square-tipped tail. The primary remiges are smooth-edged, and the flight is not unusually noisy. Young birds are matt black on the chest and belly, lacking the iridescence of the adults. Despite being a common attendant at many picnic sites in the Kruger National Park, this species is surprisingly poorly known. It often associates with other glossy starlings, spending much of its time on the ground where it walks with long strides. It favours camel-thorn or knob-thorn habitats, and avoids miombo woodland.</p><p>The lowveld population seems to be completely separated from the rest of the species’ range in southern Africa, although there are no clear differences in plumage or size between the two groups. During the non-breeding season, Burchell’s Starlings form flocks of up to 50 individuals, and gather in groups on the ground before flying off to roost in trees or reed beds. Some roosts of more than 1&#160;000 birds have been reported. The diet includes quite large animal prey including locusts and centipedes, and observers have reported that Burchell’s Starlings are quick to approach bal-chatri traps baited with small mice. There have been several reports of partially leucistic birds.</p><p>The lowveld population seems to be completely separated from the rest of the species’ range in southern Africa, although there are no clear differences in plumage or size between the two groups.

No courtship displays have been described, but the birds have a loud song, often calling with the head thrown back and the wings drooped. Nests are usually in tree holes, either natural cavities or holes excavated by barbets or woodpeckers, although occasionally holes in a cliff or a building are used. On one occasion, a nest was placed in the tower of a windmill. Burchell’s Starlings readily accept nest boxes. Both sexes carry in nesting material, which may include grass, leaves (often fresh and green), dung, sloughed snake skins and debris like string and paper. The female is solely responsible for incubation and brooding, but both members of the pair feed the nestlings.</p><p>Successive broods may be raised in the same nest during a single breeding season, and the nest site is often reused in subsequent years. Burchell’s Starlings are regular brood hosts of Great Spotted Cuckoos. Nevertheless with only one cuckoo chick in the nest, young starlings may be raised alongside it. This starling is also occasionally parasitised by Greater Honeyguides, in which case its own brood is lost. A captive individual produced hybrid offspring with a Red-winged Starling, but such an event is unlikely to occur in the wild.</p>",

The birds are seldom recorded in broad-leaved woodlands, but do occur, particularly where the broad-leaved woodland abuts fine-leaved woodland. It is uncertain how tolerant Burnt-necked Eremomelas are as far as habitat transformation is concerned, but the birds do occur in gardens in south-eastern Zimbabwe, provided that there are suitable acacia trees. This suggests that the birds accept some modifications to their natural habitat as long as the structure (particularly canopy height and undergrowth) has not been altered.</p><p>Burnt-necked Eremomelas are considered to be fairly common, but my experience of the birds at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, Limpopo Province, is that they were not often seen, and rather localised. The density of Burnt-necked Eremomelas in mixed acacia woodland at Nylsvley was about one bird per 9 ha. The birds were most often seen at the reserve in tall Umbrella Thorn Acacia tortilis trees adjacent to a small hill, and were usually in pairs. Elsewhere small groups of four to six birds have been recorded. Burnt-necked Eremomelas are highly active, moving restlessly through the canopy, gleaning items from leaves and twigs. They seldom forage lower down in trees or in saplings and tall shrubs. Food of this species is poorly known. Only broad categories of food items have been recorded – small insects, their larvae and spiders, are mainly eaten, but the birds have also been recorded eating nectar of the Mountain Aloe Aloe marlothii.</p><p>Burnt-necked Eremomelas are considered to be fairly common, but my experience of the birds at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, Limpopo Province, is that they were not often seen, and rather localised.

Their distribution in southern Africa follows the distribution of the mesic fine-leaved woodlands, from central and northern Namibia east through northern and eastern Botswana, most of Zimbabwe, extreme north-west and south of Mozambique, and northern and eastern South Africa.</p><p>At least some Burnt-necked Eremomelas breed co-operatively, with helpers at nests when a group effort at finding food and feeding the nestlings would be more successful than only a pair of birds. However, most reports on nest-building and other aspects of nesting in this species seem to be studies of a pair, rather than a group effort. The nest is built by one bird, probably the female, accompanied by the male. The members of the pair sing frequently during nest-building, a very high-pitched, rapidly repeated ‘twee-twip-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti’ varying in tempo and dropping in pitch, sometimes becoming a trill, ‘tirrrrr’. The nest is of soft plant down, felted together to form a small, thin-walled cup, covered on the outside with decorations of insect egg capsules or dry leaves, once with transparent bubbly flakes from dried mantid egg capsules. Nests are placed high – up to 6 metres – in the canopy of (usually) an acacia tree, and are slung and bound onto a horizontal fork and other supporting twigs. Almost always two eggs are laid, although up to four eggs in a clutch have been recorded. Incubation is by both sexes, and the nestlings are fed and brooded by both parents. If there is an early failure of the breeding attempt, Burnt-necked Eremomelas may nest again, and can have up to three nesting attempts during the breeding season, presumably in high rainfall years.&#9;</p>",

It was thought to be a type of aberrant bulbul until taxonomists (those whose business it is to determine who is related to whom) decided that it belonged in the babbler family. Recently, however, some taxonomists have ruled that all the members of the babbler family Timaliidae are in fact members of the Warbler family Sylviidae! It is evident, however, that such a diverse group of large and small birds cannot all be sufficiently related to belong to a single family.</p><p>Whatever its true relationship might be, the Bush Blackcap is an interesting bird in its own right.

It is an appropriately named, sparrow-sized bird with a black cap and dove grey under-plumage. Its most distinctive feature, however, is its coral-pink beak.</p><p>Although a forest bird, it is not one that spends much time in the canopy unless there is a fruit-laden tree to attract it, so would-be observers don’t risk a crick in the neck when trying to spot it. It is more usually to be found in the mid-strata or undergrowth. Because it is not a widespread species, one of the best areas to find it is in the forest patches along the foothill slopes of the Drakensberg escarpment. These fragmented pockets of forest are largely confined to deep gullies and ravines which offer protection from the fires that frequently sweep through the surrounding grassveld. Such forests typically have a fringing growth of OuhoutLeucosidea sericea; in more exposed sites the gullies may contain pure stands of this gnarled,frost-resistant tree, and Bush Blackcaps freely inhabit such sites.</p><p>During the summer months the Bush Blackcap’s presence in any forest patch is demonstrated by the male’s song, which is a fairly loud mixture of melodious notes, reminiscent of the song of the Chestnut-vented Tit-babbler, and sometimes similar to bulbul or greenbul song. During the cooler half of the year, however, these birds are comparatively silent, uttering only their warning call, a rather quiet ‘burg’ note, although a male can usually be called to viewing distance by tape-playback of Bush Blackcap song.</p><p>This species is a partial altitudinal migrant; an unknown portion of the population in the breeding areas moves down to lower altitude escarpment forests or even to coastal areas in the Eastern Cape. Because of the Bush Blackcap’s comparatively covert habits, little is known about the extent of this seasonal migration. The lower limits of the breeding population are not well established, but apparent pairs are encountered at winter destinations, so it seems unlikely that the migrants are mainly drawn from the ‘floaters’ – those individuals that cannot find mates or unoccupied space in the breeding areas. Single birds have been seen and photographed in some Johannesburg suburbs, but the age of these birds was not known, so they might have been either dispersing juveniles or misplaced migrant adults.</p>",

The birds nest in spring, with most of the nesting occurring in October in the brachystegia of central Zimbabwe.

It is thus no surprise that the batis was, until comparatively recently, thought to be a type of flycatcher. Then, on anatomical and behavioural grounds, they were placed (along with their close relatives, the wattle-eyes) in the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae, a move that made the conventional wisdom about shrike relationships even more controversial than it already was. However, although still considered to be close to the bush-shrikes, they are now placed in their own family, the Platysteiridae. No matter what their true lineage is, these African endemics are handsome members of our avifauna.</p><p>Foraging activity by the Cape Batis involves gleaning from leaves, twigs and bark.

No matter what their true lineage is, these African endemics are handsome members of our avifauna.</p><p>The Cape Batis has a very characteristic and rather quiet, churring call that is difficult to describe. Leastwise, none of the transliterations in a range of reference books bring to my mind the calls of the Cape Batis. The best description I’ve come across is that of the late C&#160;J&#160;Skead, who likened what he termed the ‘rolling call’ to the sound of two stones being ground together. Due to the nature of the favoured habitat, one hears this call (which is voiced throughout the year) more often than one sees the caller(s). The male advertises his presence and defends his territory with a plaintive two- or three-syllable territorial whistle ‘hui, hui, hui’, often voiced while the female is uttering the churring call.</p><p>The Cape Batis is known to form permanent pair bonds and to maintain permanent year-round territories in optimum habitat. Territory size estimates range from 0.3 ha to 1 ha, presumably depending on the density of the population and the abundance of food. In some areas of Zimbabwe (such as Matobo Hills), appropriate habitat patches are small, and populations are also small and quite isolated. Both sexes participate in the building of the nest, which is decorated with lichen and bound with spider silk. The usual clutch is of two eggs. The Cape Batis is one of the common hosts of Klaas’s Cuckoo, and although the pinkish egg of the cuckoo does not match the greenish eggs of the host, the batis commonly accepts the cuckoo’s egg.</p><p>Occasionally (usually in early spring) one may come across a Cape Batis gathering or ‘parliament’ of usually some ten or more birds. These are presumably young birds in their first year that are without territories or mates. They get quite excitable and noisy, with much churring, flying about with very audible wing ‘fripping’ and much fluffing of rump feathers.</p><p>Like several other species of birds that are common in Afromontane forest, the Cape Batis manages to cross ‘non-forest’ gaps to reach other forests or liveable areas, and in regions with steep gradients from coast to mountain, it is a known altitudinal migrant. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the ‘toppie’ of the winter rainfall region, though its range extends marginally into summer rainfall regions of the Eastern Cape, where it overlaps and hybridises with the Dark-capped Bulbul. It also ranges up through the drier areas of the west coast as far as the Gariep River. In this area, as well as in the north-eastern extremities of its range, it co-occurs and interbreeds with the Red-eyed Bulbul.</p><p>Like its close relatives, the Cape Bulbul is mainly frugivorous, showing a preference for small fruits and for nectar-rich flowers such as Salvia species, which daily attract sizeable gatherings of these birds when in full flower. Surprisingly, however, it appears to ignore some fruit bonanzas which other birds find irresistible. For example, I watched the avian visitors to an African Peach Tree Kiggelaria africana for the several weeks duration of a bumper fruit crop. The 20 mm-diameter ripe fruit capsules of this tree split open into five valves, exposing black seeds coated with a sticky, orange-coloured aril. This aril is the attraction and prize for most avian visitors. Twelve different species of birds were observed eating the fruit, but the locally common Cape Bulbuls were surprising absentees, especially since they frequently perched in an adjacent Dogwood Tree Rhamnus prinoides to pluck and swallow its small berries.</p><p>Like its close relatives, the Cape Bulbul is mainly frugivorous, showing a preference for small fruits and for nectar-rich flowers such as Salvia species, which daily attract sizeable gatherings of these birds when in full flower.

The pods of this tree split open to reveal jet-black seeds, each with an orange-red, aril-like rim. This brightly coloured, oil-rich portion provides nutritious fare for a wide range of birds, and Cape Bulbuls can always be found where there are stands of Rooikrans trees.</p><p>Other alien trees bearing sought-after fruits include the Pepper Tree Schinus molle (a South American species) and the Syringa or Persian Lilac Melia adzerach. The creamy yellow Syringa fruits are alleged to be poisonous for humans, yet are feasted on with relish and seeming impunity by many different birds, including all three southern African Pycnonotus bulbuls, and by introduced Grey Squirrels on the Cape Peninsula.</p><p>The Cape Bulbul is as vociferous as its cousins and, like the Dark-capped Bulbul, neighbouring territorial males share song repertoires. Calling is most frequent in the early morning, but in the initial stages of the breeding season they call at any time of the day. They avoid drawing attention to themselves in the vicinity of the nest, however, especially when this is sited in a skimpy tree or vine against a veranda pillar. Indeed, a pair often manages to build a nest and incubate the eggs without householder detection, but give themselves away with their ratchet-like alarm notes when there are nestlings to feed. They are noteworthy for their ability to build nests in many exotic trees and shrubs, and have thus benefited greatly from the establishment of gardens.</p><p>Cape Bulbuls mostly attempt to raise at least two broods per year, but nesting success is not very high, and only about 18% of fledglings survive their first month. The species is abundant, however, and annual adult survival has been estimated at 72%, with the oldest bird recaptured alive and well 12 years after being ringed.</p><p>One of the factors affecting breeding success is brood parasitism by Jacobin Cuckoos. In the Eastern Cape this bulbul is the most frequent host of the Jacobin Cuckoo (as is the Dark-capped Bulbul in other parts of this cuckoo’s range) and in this region as many as 35% of Cape Bulbul clutches may be parasitised.</p>",

Most have distinctive songs that are repeated for long periods from a prominent perch, and the Cape Bunting is no exception. Its loud and far-carrying call, mainly heard in the spring and summer breeding season, is one of the characteristic sounds of the Western Cape countryside, particularly in rocky areas and in the sandy strandveld of the West Coast. Currently eight races are recognised, occurring from Cape Agulhas to southern Angola and Malawi, but avoiding the wetter parts of the east coast and the arid Kalahari Basin.</p><p>The planting of cereal crops and the resultant loss of natural vegetation must have led to a decrease in their numbers on the coastal plains but they still occur in good numbers and certainly cannot be regarded as a threatened species. In the east of its range it is considered to be a montane species, occurring as high as 2&#160;500 metres up in the Drakensberg Mountains. Over much of the western part of its range it is found down to sea level, and nests have been observed near Steenbras River mouth on the False Bay coast that were close enough to the sea to be covered in salt spray during spring tides. They are one of many species that regularly feed in the intertidal zone, hunting for the pupaeof dipteran flies.</p><p>The planting of cereal crops and the resultant loss of natural vegetation must have led to a decrease in their numbers on the coastal plains but they still occur in good numbers and certainly cannot be regarded as a threatened species.

They are one of many species that regularly feed in the intertidal zone, hunting for the pupaeof dipteran flies.</p><p>Cape Buntings can become very accepting of humans and, on scenic routes around the False Bay coast, they are a common sight at view points and picnic areas where they diligently search for crumbs and other titbits, sometimes hopping between parked cars. Consequently it is a well-known bird locally, even non-birders being fascinated by their antics. They are not really known as suburban birds but they do enter village gardens in the Great Karoo, and are common and tame around farmsteads.</p><p>Unlike Lark-like Buntings, with which they often co-occur, Cape Buntings do not form flocks, usually being encountered singly or in pairs. There is no convincing evidence of large-scale movements and most are probably sedentary, but an influx into the Koeberg Private Nature Reserve near Cape Town has been noted between September and April. Because they need to drink regularly, they are forced to move away from areas where water supplies dry up. The construction of windmills and farm dams must have benefited them, and many other seed-eating species too, allowing them to remain year-round in areas that would otherwise be unsuitable during the dry season.</p><p>Normally they choose a nest site on a stream bank or in vegetation hanging down in front of a rock but where these conditions are not available they will nest in a low bush much as a canary would do. Some Cape Buntings become quite imaginative in their choice of nest site. One pair nested successfully in a pelargonium shrub next to the front steps of busy self-catering cottages near Barandas in the Little Karoo. The owners were thrilled to have these ‘sparrows’ nesting so confidently on their premises! Cape Buntings have also been known to nest on a shelf of a farm workshop rather in the manner of a Cape Wagtail or Familiar Chat.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cape Canary is more closely related to the domesticated canary (derived from Serinus canaria of the Atlantic islands off the north-west coast of Africa) than are any of the other species of canaries and seedeaters in southern Africa. It used to be thought to extend all the way to Ethiopia, but it has since been split from the Yellow-crowned Canary, so it is now endemic to southern Africa. The Cape Canary has the same plaintive ‘sweeet’ call that one hears from the cage-bred birds, be they ‘Red Factors’ or ‘Yorkshires’ or ‘Rollers’, and its long, rambling song, adjudged by many to be sweetest of all the local canaries, is immediately recognisable as that of a canary, even to those with scant knowledge of wild birds. As with other members of the family, it is the males that sing, and a singleton male in full song will immediately command attention.</p><p>Although common in favoured habitat of grassland, fynbos and cool upland areas, this species avoids the drier regions and shuns hot low-lying areas such as Maputaland. Altitudinal movements by winter flocks are frequently observed, but have not been well studied.</p><p>Although common in favoured habitat of grassland, fynbos and cool upland areas, this species avoids the drier regions and shuns hot low-lying areas such as Maputaland. Altitudinal movements by winter flocks are frequently observed, but have not been well studied.</p><p>When abundant food supplies attract large numbers of these canaries, flocks of 30 to 50 birds are commonplace and some flocks comprise hundreds of individuals. In Jack Skead’s 1960 monograph on southern African canaries, seedeaters and buntings, the flock singing of Cape Canaries is aptly described as ‘choiring’. It can be heard most frequently in the breeding season, and is usually uttered from the tops of tall trees such as gums Eucalyptus sp.</p><p>Cape Canaries are essentially seed preda&#173;tors, with the bulk of their diet derived from what botanists call ‘achenes’,small, dry, non-splitting, one-seeded ‘fruits’. These canaries can be attracted to bird tables offering small seeds, but they prefer green achenes to dry birdseed, and they may show more interest in seeding dandelions than the seed tray. They are also very fond of the tiny dry seeds from the mini-cones that litter the ground beneath Beefwood Trees Casuarina sp. Like other obligate seedeaters, they may be unable to derive sufficient moisture from their diet to satisfy their daily needs, so they drink frequently at any time of the day, even before sunrise. After rain they often resort to roadside puddles, in which they may bathe as well as drink.</p><p>Breeding time varies regionally according to predominant rainy months; most records are between spring and late summer. Many nests are built in alien trees such as oaks and pines, perhaps because these are the highest trees available in certain areas. Nests may be sited as high as 18 metres above ground, but if no tall trees are available, they readily nest in shrubs. A nest I found in northern KwaZulu-Natal was little more than one metre up in a rose bush at the edge of a roadside tea garden. Plants of the daisy family Compositae, which are so important in their diet, provide Cape Canaries with significant portions of their nesting material, especially everlastings (Helichrysum species). Sheep’s wool is also used liberally when available.</p><p>The female incubates the three or four eggs, and is often fed at the nest by the male.  Both parents feed the nestlings with regurgitated seed and small amounts of grit, the latter to assist the chicks’ stomachs to grind up the hard seeds. When fledged, the young Cape Canaries show heavy streaking on underparts and mantle.</p>",

It is largely divided from that species geographically, but their respective ranges in parts of the Eastern Cape require elucidation. Compared with that species, it is smaller, with less rufous in the flight feathers and on the darker, greyer and more heavily marked upperparts. Its dorsal surface is particularly intricate and quail-like in its patterning.</p><p>Despite its limited distribution, this lark has two subspecies. Mirafra a. marjoriae (Agulhas Clapper Lark) has a particularly circumscribed range restricted to the narrow coastal plains between the Cape Peninsula and Knysna, primarily on the heavily farmed Agulhas coastal plain. There is a now isolated population of marjoriae in the southern Cape Peninsula. The two races differ strongly, both genetically and in vocalisations, to the extent that they may represent separate species. ‘They are fairly similar in appearance, with extensive plumage variation within sites, though marjoriae is somewhat greyer overall, and further investigation is called for.</p><p>Despite its limited distribution, this lark has two subspecies.

The southern Cape Peninsula population occurs in mountain fynbos. It has adapted well to the artificial pastures and cereal crop fields now dominant in the higher rainfall parts of its range but only where these lie adjacent to natural vegetation. It is essentially endemic to South Africa, perhaps extending marginally into southern Namibia. This lark is difficult to spot unless displaying, and it is loath to flush.</p><p>The Cape Clapper Lark is similar to the Flappet Lark in its wing clapping but differs in retaining a prominent vocal element to the performance. The displays of both races of this lark have been studied by Peter Ryan and Helene Marshall. The male flies up steeply from the ground or a low perch and begins the wing clapping virtually immediately. The upward flight becomes increasingly vertical, and the wing rattle accelerates in rate until the bird suddenly peaks at a height of about 5-8 m and parachutes back to earth. In the Flappet Lark the rate of wing flapping remains constant throughout the display. The extraordinary and demanding wing rattle, apparently produced by the wings of the bird clapping together below the body, at its peak achieves a rate even higher than that found in the Flappet Lark.</p><p>Two whistling calls are given close to the peak of the display flight, and these differ quite distinctly between the two races. In the nominate race the first call is highly truncated and barely noticeable, and the second note is a clear ascending whistle. In marjoriae both notes are distinct descending whistles. The whistling calls are audible over a greater distance than the wing clapping and it is easy to confuse them with the whistling songs of the various long-billed larks that overlap with the Cape Clapper Lark.</p><p>The display of the nominate race is similar to that of the Eastern Clapper Lark, but in that species the rate of wing clapping is slower and does not accelerate, the main whistled song ranges less in pitch, melodious notes may be tagged onto the end of the display, and display during a high cruising flight is more common. Mimicry has been recorded but less often than in the Eastern Clapper Lark.</p><p>The nesting habits of this lark are poorly known. It is monogamous and probably territorial. The nest is placed on the ground against, and sometimes even within, a tuft of vegetation and is partially domed. The clutch size is 2-3 marked eggs.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This slender, mid-sized cormorant is one of the most numerous seabirds in the Benguela upwelling region. Historically they were economically important as a key guano producer. Adults are easily recognised by their yellow gular skin, which turns chrome-orange just before breeding, when their turquoise eyes are accentuated by green eye-rings with cobalt-blue spots. Immatures are browner and duller than adults, but are still easily differentiated from other cormorants by their long, slender bill, short tail and pale brown gular skin.</p><p>Cape Cormorants mainly feed at sea, but young birds often occur at estuaries and coastal wetlands. They breed from southern Angola to Bird Island in the Eastern Cape, but immatures and non-breeders disperse more widely, reaching central Angola and following the sardine run to KwaZulu-Natal and even southern Mozambique in winter. Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Gabon, and occasionally straggle as much as 50 kilometres inland in southern Africa.</p><p>Cape Cormorants mainly feed at sea, but young birds often occur at estuaries and coastal wetlands.

Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Gabon, and occasionally straggle as much as 50 kilometres inland in southern Africa.</p><p>Although they can feed singly, Cape Cormorants typically occur in large flocks. They often venture far from land, exceptionally up to 80 kilometres offshore, because much of their foraging targets pelagic rather than benthic fish. Indeed their fate is linked to the abundance of anchovies and sardines. They use two tactics to exploit these fish that are seldom employed by other cormorants. First, although their plumage is partly wettable to reduce buoyancy while diving, they are not obliged to return to shore to roost between foraging bouts. It is not unusual to see large flocks roosting on the sea. Second, they spend more time flying than most other cormorants. Breeding birds may fly for an hour or more in search of their patchily distributed prey. This behaviour explains their Afrikaans name Trekduiker. To save energy, they often fly in long lines to reduce wind resistance.</p><p>All foraging takes place during the day. They dive for up to 70 seconds and reach depths of up to 34 metres, but most dives are shorter and descend to less than 20 metres. When targeting benthic fish they dive rapidly to the bottom to maximise the effective portion of the dive, whereas descent and ascent rates are slower when targeting pelagic prey. Non-breeding birds foraging close to shore make short foraging trips, lasting only 20-30 minutes, whereas breeding adults, typically, make substantially longer trips lasting 2-4 hours. Adults foraging for small chicks usually make 3-4 foraging trips per day, completing 100-400 dives and spending 1-2 hours underwater.</p><p>Cape Cormorants breed colonially. The numbers breeding in any given year vary greatly, linked to the availability of their prey. Most breeding colonies are on offshore islands or inaccessible coastal cliffs, but they also occur on islands in coastal wetlands and on man-made structures, including wrecked and abandoned ships, and guano platforms. On Namibia’s Skeleton Coast they even breed 7 kilometres inland at a small oasis.</p><p>Despite their abundance, Cape Cormorants are listed as Near-threatened. Their numbers were boosted from 1930 to 1970 by the provision of artificial nesting platforms to promote guano production in central Namibia, but they have decreased markedly over the last few decades. In Namibia this has been driven by the collapse of pelagic fish stocks following overfishing, but in South Africa local shortages of pelagic fish have been exacerbated by human disturbance at breeding sites, predation of chicks by Great White Pelicans and outbreaks of avian cholera. Careful management of the offshore breeding islands, as well as pelagic fish stocks, are needed to ensure that skeins of Cape Cormorants remain a characteristic feature of Benguela coastal waters.</p>",

Its distribution, however, is oddly patchy; it is common, for example, in the Succulent Karoo, but scarce or absent in much of the Nama Karoo, common in the central Kalahari, but not in the semi-arid savanna to the south, and it is inexplicably absent from the western coastal plain.</p><p>It has a slender beak and very glossy plumage – glossy enough to shine like a piece of upturned glass or tin in a ploughed field when the sun is at the right angle. These omnivorous birds are often to be seen in such places because they enjoy eating sprouting seed, including corn seed, a habit that has not endeared them to maize and cereal farmers. They also eat sedge bulbs and small fruits of shrubs common in semi-arid regions. They are regularly seen along roadways, both because they commonly nest on telephone poles in treeless regions and because they are roadkill scavengers, though they do not resort to scavenging as frequently as does the Pied Crow.</p><p>It has a slender beak and very glossy plumage – glossy enough to shine like a piece of upturned glass or tin in a ploughed field when the sun is at the right angle.

They are regularly seen along roadways, both because they commonly nest on telephone poles in treeless regions and because they are roadkill scavengers, though they do not resort to scavenging as frequently as does the Pied Crow.</p><p>Cape Crows are usually encountered in territorial pairs or in family groups (three or four birds), but may collect into flocks of 30 to 50 or more birds at good feeding spots or habitual roosting sites. Non-territorial individuals may fly up to 20 kilometres to favoured roosts and aggregate into flocks of hundreds. Breeding pairs often choose quite exposed sites as roosts. In a Little Karoo village, for example, a pair of Cape Crows regularly roosted on domestic power lines, although there were seemingly suitable alternative sites (such as tall Eucalyptus trees) nearby. They fledged two young, and all four roosted together until one fateful evening in December when, after a downpour of rain, two of them were electrocuted and found dead on the road verge beneath the power lines. Crows rank high on the scale of bird intelligence, but (as with mankind) they have no instinctive fear of the hazards of electricity.</p><p>Crows are indeed clever birds, a fact often demonstrated by hand-reared or captive individuals. An example, contributed by a correspondent to a birding magazine, involved a Cape Crow that was rescued with a broken wing and subsequently kept in a large aviary. Whenever a mother bantam with young brood passed by, the crow enticed the chicks to run in through the diamond mesh wall of its aviary by imitating the bantam’s “I’ve found food” call. The hen could not get through the wire, of course, and so was unable to protect her chicks, which the crow despatched with quick and deadly pecks before burying them for subsequent consumption.</p><p>Cape Crows, like Pied Crows, sometimes incorporate wire, rope and other artificial materials into their stick nests. The female builds the nest, using material collected and delivered by her mate. Where woodlots of Eucalyptus trees occur, the nest is usually placed in the topmost twig cluster, anything up to 24 metres above the ground. Such nest sites are not inviolate, however, for some are commandeered by Egyptian Geese once they are completed. Countrywide, some 10% of clutches are also subject to parasitism by Great Spotted Cuckoos. Although these crows lay three to four eggs, only one or two chicks commonly survive to fledge, so their breeding success rate is rather low. Nevertheless, the Cape Crow manages to hold its own, and although it enters small towns and villages, it has not, to its credit, become an urban pest like the Pied Crow.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cape Eagle-Owl is essentially a species of mountainous areas and has a discontinuous range that extends from the southern Cape to Ethiopia, following the fragmented chain of highland areas that stretches along the eastern side of the continent. Several forms of the owl occur along this chain, those in the south (the nominate race Bubo capensis capensis) being substantially smaller than those in the north. Zimbabwe birds, which approach Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl in size, belong to the northern race (Bubo capensis mackinderi)and they usually go by the name Mackinder’s Eagle-Owl in that country.</p><p>By contrast, South African Cape Eagle-Owls are not very noticeably larger than Spotted Eagle-Owls and in places where these two species occur together, some care is needed in telling them apart. Their calls are quite different, so when heard calling in the dead of night there is no difficulty in making the distinction, but when seen, a view is needed of the bird’s front: if richly blotched and barred with rufous and black it is Cape Eagle-Owl; if chest blotching is grey, and underparts are finely barred with grey and white, it is Spotted Eagle-Owl. Eye colour is usually quite different too, those of the Cape Eagle-Owl invariably being rich orange, whereas Spotted Eagle-Owls mostly have yellow eyes, with occasional rufous-form individuals having a more orange eye. A further distinction is in the respective foot and talon size of the two species, with those of the Cape Eagle-Owl being substantially larger.</p><p>By contrast, South African Cape Eagle-Owls are not very noticeably larger than Spotted Eagle-Owls and in places where these two species occur together, some care is needed in telling them apart.

A further distinction is in the respective foot and talon size of the two species, with those of the Cape Eagle-Owl being substantially larger.</p><p>Cape Eagle-Owls are characteristically birds of rocky, hilly or mountainous country, often in places entirely devoid of trees, but essential features needed are deep rocky ravines, rock scarps or cliffs that provide the birds with safe roosting and nesting sites. The birds often occur in remote, unpopulated country and the males’ far-carrying, deep hooting call in the quiet of the night accentuates the sense of bleakness that pervades such landscapes. In parts of their range, such as in the Maluti Mountains and the surrounding fringes of the Drakensberg, Cape Eagle-Owls have to contend with snowfalls and temperatures well below freezing at times during winter, and yet this is the time of year when the birds choose to breed.</p><p>Strictly nocturnal, the birds venture from their daytime roosts at dusk to hunt. The capensis race preys mainly on rodents, and in the high Drakensberg, for example, species such as the 80-gram Ice Rat Otomys sloggetti are commonly taken. By contrast the mackinderi race hunts mainly dassies, hares and Red Rock Rabbits, prey that often weighs 2 kilograms or more. Pellets are cast where the birds roost during the day, and it is these that have provided much of the information on what the birds eat. Some nest sites develop a thick accumulation of pellet fragments – referred to as ‘ossuaries’ in some books – and in these the nest scrape is set into the bed of fur and bone fragments.</p><p>Nest sites are invariably on a sheltered or overhung ledge on a cliff, and these are used again and again over the years. While one bird is incubating, its mate is usually to be found roosting somewhere close by, and this general area of activity is often given away by the presence of the birds’ chalky white mutes that accumulate on surrounding rocks. Laying takes place mainly during May-June, later in the southern Cape, and two eggs form the usual clutch. The nesting cycle matches that of other owls, with the female performing most of the incubation, and she is fed by the male; he may briefly take a shift while she eats the prey he has brought in. The nesting cycle, from egg-laying to fledging, takes a little less than four months.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Adult Cape Gannets are easily differentiated from the smaller, tropical boobies by their striking black and white plumage and gold-washed heads. Up close, their black facial skin contrasts with their creamy-white eyes and powder-blue eye-rings, and their dark grey legs and toes are accentuated by pale green stripes. Juveniles have grey-brown plumage, finely spotted white, which is replaced over 2-3 years, starting with the belly and head. Some immatures can be confused with boobies, but they are usually found among groups of adults.</p><p>Cape Gannets only breed in southern Africa. They are largely confined to the productive waters of the Benguela upwelling region of Namibia and the west and south coasts of South Africa, but thousands follow the winter Sardine run to southern KwaZulu-Natal. Some non-breeders also disperse north along the west coast of Africa as far as Nigeria. They seldom leave coastal waters, but vagrants have reached Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Argentina and Brazil.</p><p>Cape Gannets only breed in southern Africa.

Some non-breeders also disperse north along the west coast of Africa as far as Nigeria. They seldom leave coastal waters, but vagrants have reached Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Argentina and Brazil.</p><p>Gannets are excellent exponents of plunge-diving, dropping from up to 20 metres in the air and furling their wings to enter the water with the grace of an Olympic diver. They are so streamlined that they experience very little resistance on hitting the water and typically have to brake once they reach their prey. Their momentum carries them to 8-10 metres, and they can swim down 20-30 metres in pursuit of deeper prey by flapping their partly furled wings.</p><p>Their preferred prey is Sardines, but they take a wide diversity of pelagic fish, including Anchovy, Round Herring, Saury and, in Namibia, Pelagic Gobies. Large flocks gather to feed on fish schools, often with Cape Cormorants, African Penguins, Common Dolphins, Cape Fur Seals and Bryde’s Whales. Cape Gannets also are adept at scavenging from fishing vessels, especially hake trawlers, but fishery discards are of a lower quality than their natural prey. Prior to 2000, scavenging at trawlers occurred mainly in the winter non-breeding period, but since 2000 the local shortage of pelagic fish off the west coast of South Africa has forced gannets to scavenge year-round in this area, reducing chick growth rates and ultimately impacting on breeding success.</p><p>Cape Gannets breed in dense colonies, building nests from guano and other material. Breeding typically occurs in spring, with both sexes taking turns to incubate the one (rarely two) eggs with their feet. The chicks are brooded for two to three weeks, then guarded by one parent until they are six weeks old. Adults feeding small chicks have fairly short foraging trips, leaving the colony in the morning, foraging, and then resting on the water to digest their catch before foraging again for their chicks and returning to the colony. However, they can range up to 300 kilometres from the colony, and larger chicks may only be fed every few days. The chicks fledge about three months after hatching.</p><p>There are six colonies on Mercury, Ichaboe and Possession Islands in Namibia and Lambert’s Bay, Malgas and Bird Island (Algoa Bay) in South Africa. The Lambert’s Bay colony was threatened in 2005 when Cape Fur Seals attacked and killed adults, causing them to abandon the colony. Only the swift intervention by conservation bodies to exclude seals from the colony, allowed the colony to persist. Fur seals also impact gannets at sea. Some immature male seals learn to hunt gannets, especially newly-fledged juveniles. A handful of seals kill 30-70% of the chicks fledging from Malgas Island each year. Such losses are unsustainable, and efforts are made to cull the seals involved. Gannets also are susceptible to outbreaks of avian cholera and heat stress, but the gravest threat they face is the depletion of their natural prey. Gannet numbers in Namibia crashed by 90%, following overfishing of Sardines. Recent descreases in populations at Lambert’s Bay and Malgas Island have been exacerbated by the shortage of Sardines and Anchovies off the west coast of South Africa. Only the colony on Bird Island in Algoa Bay remains healthy.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Although they are an everyday sight in many areas, Cape Glossy Starlings are striking birds with their bright yellow eyes and wonderfully iridescent plumage, in shades of greenish blue. An earlier common name was ‘Red-shouldered Glossy Starling’, and there is a small coppery (not red) patch on the bend of the wing – which is the wrist joint, not the shoulder. The rows of dark spots on the wing coverts have been proposed as a characteristic which can be used to separate different species of glossy starlings, but this is not a reliable feature, since the number of spots shown varies according to the position of the feathers. Young birds are initially duller-plumaged, and start life with dark eyes, which soon become straw-coloured; within a year they are not visually distinguishable from the adults.</p><p>Another field characteristic of this species is its noisy flight, with the wings producing a loud ‘whooshing’ noise. In the hand, the inner margins of the three outer primary feathershave indentations, which are the source of this sound. However, we do not know whether it serves as a signal of some sort to the birds themselves. They are vocal birds, and often gather in groups in a large shady tree in the middle of the day, where they sing in ‘choirs’. The possible function of this behaviour remains obscure. Usually they are encountered in small groups, which may represent family parties, but they also gather in larger flocks at feeding or roosting sites or drinking places in drier areas like the Kalahari. Apart from fruit and insects, Cape Glossy Starlings feed regularly at nectar sources, and at times their faces are coated with pollen from aloes. They sometimes associate with ungulates, perching on them to hawk insects, and removing ticks and other ectoparasites. At many picnic sites in the Kruger National Park they are very tame, and are adept at stealing unattended food items.</p><p>Another field characteristic of this species is its noisy flight, with the wings producing a loud ‘whooshing’ noise.

They also accept nest boxes with a suitably-sized entrance hole. The nest is lined with a variety of material, including dung, leaves, shed snake skins, wool and grass; feathers are added regularly during incubation. Pairs often remain together for successive seasons, and the same nest site may be used repeatedly – in one case, for 20 years, so that more than one breeding pair was surely involved.</p><p>Only the female incubates the eggs, while the male perches nearby and warbles for long periods – this behaviour seems to be common to many, if not all, African starlings. When the eggs hatch, other individuals, usually subadult birds, help the parents to feed the chicks. At one nest, an individual helped at the nest in four successive seasons, without apparently attempting to breed independently. There seems to be a clear hierarchy in feeding, with some birds unable to deliver food until the more dominant individuals have left the nest site. After the chicks have fledged, they are fed by their parents and helpers for at least a week. Cape Glossy Starlings are occasional brood hosts of Great Spotted Cuckoos, and there is one record of parasitism by Greater Honeyguides.</p>",

At the observer’s approach, the Grassbird will normally take flight with drooping tail and rapid wingbeats for a short distance until it can plummet, mousebird-like, into another bush. Unlike its song, the Grassbird’s warning call, a rather catlike ‘meew’, is not loud at all, and the bird is often well hidden when uttering it.</p><p>Foraging takes place low down in dense vegetation or on the ground beneath it. The birds clamber about in and around grass tussocks or bracken, frequently flicking their wings open and shut. In the Kirstenbosch National Botanic Gardens at Cape Town the Grassbirds have become habituated to people, and I have seen a pair scuttling around like mice beneath planted ground covers, only half a metre from my feet. Not much is known about their diet, but it is assumed to be primarily of insects (including beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars) and also includes small seeds, presumably picked up off the ground.</p><p>Cape Grassbirds are choosy about their habitat structure. It must not be too high, and they prefer soft-stemmed vegetation. In the fynbos of the Western Cape they are the dominant species with a density of one bird per hectare in moist, restio-dominated plant communities, but they vacate habitat that is invaded by alien Australian Acacia cyclopsand Acacia saligna trees.</p><p>Despite their comparative commonness in areas such as the Western Cape, the Grassbird’s habits and habitat choice render it a rare catch for bird ringers, so only a few hundred have been ringed, and the few recaptures on record indicate no movement from original capture sites. These recaptured birds were probably territory-owning residents. Recoveries of birds that skulk in dense vegetation are very unlikely, so little is known about Grassbird survival rates, or about their breeding success, though there is evidence to suggest that the species may be double-brooded.&#9;</p>",

Longclaws do most of their foraging on the ground, and when flushed they fly off with fast wingbeats interspersed by short glides, white-tipped tail spread wide, giving its rather cat-like mew call two or three times before gliding to ground and quickly moving into the cover of the grass or other low vegetation.</p><p>When not foraging, these birds often perch on a rock or termite mound, or at the top of a shrub or low tree. In this elevated position the bird’s bright orange bib stands out like a small beacon visible from a considerable distance, contrasting sharply with the usually muted colours of the bird’s surroundings. Longclaws often sun themselves on such vantage points in the early morning, but the best time to see them is at around sunset when they are apt to indulge in display flights and do a lot of calling.</p><p>When not foraging, these birds often perch on a rock or termite mound, or at the top of a shrub or low tree.

Longclaws often sun themselves on such vantage points in the early morning, but the best time to see them is at around sunset when they are apt to indulge in display flights and do a lot of calling.</p><p>One usually associates the Cape Longclaw with grassy environments, although in the Western Cape they also inhabit short fynbos, and have even been observed feeding amongst the piles of washed-up kelp in the inter-tidal zone of some Cape Peninsula beaches. I have seen one feeding along the edge of a gravel road through grassveld; whether it was searching for insect prey or grass seeds I could not determine (both insects and small seeds have been recorded in this longclaw’s diet). Foraging birds readily associate with grazing livestock, taking advantage of the beating effect of the animals’ movements in much the same way as Cattle Egrets do. Although some reference books state that these longclaws do not forage in ploughed fields, they do occasionally follow a tractor-drawn plough to snatch prey revealed in the newly turned sod. In pastures they turn over dried cowpats with their beaks and feast on the diverse insect life revealed beneath. In warmer, bush-strewn habitats such as in the Eastern Cape, they also break open soil casings constructed by termites around fallen twigs to expose and eat the insects.</p><p>With this diverse armoury of food-finding methods, the Cape Longclaw appears to cope well with environmental vicissitudes. They manage to find food in times of severe drought, despite extreme dryness of soil and vegetation. Research into diversity loss resulting from fragmentation of fynbos habitat in the Western Cape revealed that Cape Longclaws were able to reside and persist in habitat fragments as small as one hectare in extent.</p><p>Throughout the major portion of their range Cape Longclaws are obligate grassveld breeders, placing their nest on the ground, commonly in or next to a tall-standing tussock. Ground nests are apt to be at risk not only from predators but also from accidental destruction by being trodden on by a grazing cow or other large ungulate. If an observer flushes a Cape Longclaw from its nest, the bird may respond with a classic distraction display, fluttering away with one wing outstretched and tilting its body to that side. Such distraction displays are rare in passerine birds, but have been observed in other members of the Motacillidae (the wagtail, pipit and longclaw family).</p>",

Strangely, the female is the more colourful sex and although both sexes show red on the leggings and shoulders, only the female has a prominently red forehead. The juvenile, as is normal in birds, mimics the female in this regard but lacks red on the legs and shoulders. Although its appearance is striking, its high-pitched shrieks usually first draw attention to its presence as it races over its forest fastness in the swift and direct flight so typical of the family.</p><p>The taxonomy of this parrot remains frustratingly unresolved.

This parrot typically nests in cavities in yellowwood trees. The first description of breeding involves semi-captive birds; it dates back to the late 1800s and the writings of the enigmatic Woodward brothers. One intrepid pair at Ingeli Forest in KwaZulu-Natal had their nest hole directly beneath an African Crowned Eagle nest. Nestlings emit a fierce, mammal-like growling when disturbed, to deter predators.</p><p>The bond linking the towering yellowwoods and their winged champions could hardly be tighter, and the fruits of these forest giants also provide the primary natural diet of the parrot. When the bounty of these titans is seasonally unavailable, the parrots turn to fruits of other plants, e.g. White Stinkwood Celtis africana, and even the dry flower heads of proteas. In modern landscapes, Cape Parrots are also seduced by the easy ‘junk food’ to be pilfered from nearby orchards, for example Pecan Nuts Carya illinoensis, apples, plums and cherries, and they even stoop to guzzling the fare offered by despised alien invaders such as Black Wattle Acacia mearnsii and Syringa Melia azedarach. They will travel widely on such raids, as far as 100 km distant from their forest homes.</p><p>The restricted range of the Cape Parrot is now largely from Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape to Karkloof in KwaZulu-Natal, although a small outlying population persists far to the north in the Wolkberg of Limpopo Province. There is evidence of earlier presence in intervening areas between Karkloof and the Wolkberg. This is South Africa’s only endemic parrot.</p><p>For over 15 years, on a specific weekend every May, Colleen Downs has co-ordinated hundreds of dedicated birders counting Cape Parrots wheeling over their forest haunts in the early morning and late afternoon throughout their range. The results of this monumental and sustained effort suggest that the numbers of Cape Parrots, although fairly low – the highest counts come up with less than 1&#160;700 individuals – seem stable.</p><p>The Cape Parrot is listed as Vulnerable. The main threats are loss of habitat through the forest destruction, persecution by fruit farmers, collection of adults and nestlings for the cage-bird trade, and beak-and-feather disease as meticulously docu&#173;mented by Steve Boyes. This is Africa’s most threatened parrot, and a concerted effort is called for if it is to withstand the myriad of threats arrayed against its survival in the wild.</p>",

Where they overlap with the Grey Penduline Tit, this bird (the Cape) is usually found in the acacia woodland, while the Grey is found in the broad-leaved woodland.

The group moves through the bush or woodland, keeping in touch with a two-note call ‘chawee-chawee’. The territory is usually centred on a particularly thorny acacia or similar thorn bush in which the nest is hung. This is because the nest is used throughout the year for roosting at night. The whole flock roosts in the nest, and it is interesting to see six, seven or eight birds emerge from  the nest first thing in the morning. The nest is a most remarkable structure (see Grey Penduline Tit for details): it is made of very fine vegetable down which has little hooks on it and requires constant maintenance throughout the year in order to keep it in good condition. If one comes across a nest which is not neat and tidy, it’s because it is no longer being used as a roost.</p><p>It appears that the flock splits up into pairs for breeding purposes; it was observed that most of the nests studied, only ever had two birds present. More than two birds have been reported at some nests, but this is unusual. The birds lay four or five tiny eggs which are plain white. The eggs take about 14-15 days to hatch and then the young are fed in the nest for another 20-22 days. Thereafter the young leave the nest with the adults, but return each evening to roost in the nest. Where the rest of the flock go when the adult pair is breeding, has not been ascertained.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a familiar resident bird in suburban or rural gardens with hedges or shrubberies, except in coastal KwaZulu-Natal where it is an April to September visitor from the cooler mist-belt areas inland. It is absent from much of the Great Karoo, but reaches the arid west coast by way of the Gariep River (the birds of this north-western region have a noticeably broader white eyebrow stripe). The Cape Robin-Chat is very much at home in villages and towns, and even in urban centres where there are shrubs and bushes to provide cover. It pays a price for this choice, the most frequent causes of mortality in such areas being predation by cats and collisions with motor vehicles.</p><p>It is not commonly seen at the bird table (unless bonemeal or mealworms are on offer), but is a frequent user of the birdbath. It can be very confiding and likes to explore the inside of cat-free houses, sometimes becoming a daily intruder if it finds a mirror. Outside it will often attend garden activities such as clearing of weeds or old growth and the turning over of soil. Because it spends much of its time on the ground, it inevitably spies a less welcome visitor such as a cobra, and gives continued notice of the presence and whereabouts of the reptile with its guttural ‘gurg-ga-gurg’warning call.</p><p>It is not commonly seen at the bird table (unless bonemeal or mealworms are on offer), but is a frequent user of the birdbath.

Because it spends much of its time on the ground, it inevitably spies a less welcome visitor such as a cobra, and gives continued notice of the presence and whereabouts of the reptile with its guttural ‘gurg-ga-gurg’warning call.</p><p>Territory size of a breeding pair of these birds in suburbia can be as much as 0.75 ha,&#173; and an individual territory may thus include more than one garden. Most territories also host ‘floaters’, predominantly unmated males waiting for an accident to befall the male owner. They have to keep a low profile, and may have to wait a long time, because territory owners can often survive seven or more years. The oldest Cape Robin-Chat on record lived for 17 years.</p><p>This is one of the first birds to sing at dawn. It has a pleasant and distinctive song of high-pitched, melodious phrases, each starting on the same note. Unlike most other robin-chats it is not noted for mimicry of other birds’ calls, and although some individual territorial males may borrow calls or parts of calls from other birds such as Dideric or Klaas’s Cuckoos, mimicry is very much an individual trait in this species.</p><p>The female usually builds the nest, and though she may complete the main structure in only 13 hours, finding the desired lining can take several days. Nests are commonly hidden in dense shrubbery, but in keeping with their confiding nature Cape Robin-Chats will also build in hanging plant holders or potted ferns on verandas. The incubation period ranges from 13 to 19 days, with an average of 16 days. Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge in 15 to 18 days. The young robin-chat has a cryptic, mottled brown plumage, lacking the orange breast and white eyebrow stripe, with only the typical robin-chat tail providing a clue to its identity. At about six weeks after leaving the nest it starts to moult into adult plumage.</p><p>Cape Robin-Chats occasionally rear two broods, but most ‘second’ nests are replacements of earlier failed clutches or broods. Predators of eggs or nestlings are many, even in suburban gardens, and one pair of robins can make four or five attempts in one season.</p><p>One of the causes of failure is brood parasitism by the Red-chested Cuckoo, because the cuckoo hatchling instinctively heaves the robin’s eggs or chicks out of the nest. Although the chocolate-brown cuckoo egg is no match for its own eggs, the Cape Robin-Chat is the most frequent host of the Red-chested Cuckoo in South Africa, with 16-22% of its nests being parasitised in some regions. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This babbler-like, terrestrial bird has a distribution similar to that of the other fynbos endemics – from the Cedarberg in the north-west to near Port Elizabeth in the east. However, like Victorin’s Warbler and Protea Seedeater it is absent from the Cape Peninsula. It is a most handsome species, especially the male, with his bright rufous front, broad white malar stripe and black tail with white outer feathers. His bright orange-red eyes are quite striking when seen at close quarters. Not surprisingly, this species is high on the ‘wish list’ of many visiting birders.</p><p>Over much of its range, the Cape Rockjumper occurs on high, rock-strewn mountain slopes, not easily reached by casual observers. Luckily, several sites that provide a good chance of a successful sighting are accessible on public roads. Rooiels, on the eastern False Bay coast, is perhaps the best known of these. The Cape Rockjumper is a noisy and conspicuous species and, because of its habit of perching on a prominent rock and giving its loud, far-carrying ‘pee-pee-pee-pee’ call, most birders have little trouble tracking down their objective. Pairs, and family groups, are largely sedentary and there is little evidence of local migration.</p><p>Over much of its range, the Cape Rockjumper occurs on high, rock-strewn mountain slopes, not easily reached by casual observers.

Pairs, and family groups, are largely sedentary and there is little evidence of local migration.</p><p>The Cape Rockjumper is one of many bird species that can be found foraging in the intertidal zone, although it does so in only a very restricted part of its range in False Bay. It becomes tolerant of humans and one Rooiels resident had the surprise, and pleasure, of having a rockjumper enter his kitchen – luckily he was not a cat owner!</p><p>In the mid-1950s, near Sir Lowry’s Pass which transverses the Hottentots-Holland Mountains, the late Jack MacLeod spent many days observing rockjumpers at their nests. He made several interesting discoveries: although insects formed the bulk of the food delivered to nestlings, adults would also bring frogs and, on one occasion, a small lizard. He was fascinated to discover that at a number of sites, three adults were engaged in feeding the nestlings. This was the first time that the now well-known co-operative breeding habit of these birds was documented.</p><p>The nest is an untidy bowl, finely lined with thin grasses, protea down and sometimes mammal fur. It is often constructed to face away from the prevailing wind, which in the spring breeding season can be fierce. Nest building has been observed near Somerset West in late July at the coldest and wettest time of the year. Nearby, breeding pairs have been found on the upper slopes of the Franschhoek mountains where conditions must be severe at times, making one wonder how they find enough prey to satisfy hungry nestlings. Although they are usually associated with mountainsides, Cape Rockjumpers have been found nesting a mere 50 m from the sea. Most nests are situated under a rock but sometimes the protective outstretched leaves of a shrub are chosen as shelter. A plant known locally as the ‘bergpalmiet’ (Tetraria spp.) is often chosen and provides reasonable shelter for the nest.</p><p>Although the Cape Rockjumper has a restricted range, it is not considered threatened because much of its mountain habitat is in protected areas such as the Limietberg and Kogelberg Biosphere Nature Reserves. Perhaps the ever-encroaching alien acacias will pose a problem in the future, but at present this does not appear to be a major threat. Perhaps of more immediate concern is climate change. Rising temperatures are predicted to drive Fynbos species to higher altitudes, yet rockjumpers already occur at the highest altitudes, raising the question of where they might find future refuges.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Cape Rock Thrushes, in my experience, usually occur in pairs, but not always visibly, because the male, resplendent in his powder-blue head and russet chest and belly, often takes an elevated and prominent perch on a boulder or utility pole, and draws attention to his presence by singing. The female, on the other hand, is far less showy with her mottled brown head, and although she can also sing, she is usually less vociferous or silent. So the sight of an apparently solitary male need not mean that he is without a mate.</p><p>The male’s whistled song is variable, and sometimes contains mimicry, but is less varied than that of the Sentinel Rock Thrush, with which its range largely overlaps. The song is mellow and musical, and might be rendered as follows: ‘tsee-tseeyoo-tseeet, tsee-tseeyoo-tseet-chweeeyoo’. A characteristic mentioned by several authors is that each phrase ends with a ‘buzzing trill’. The contact call sounds like ‘slee-sloo’, and its alarm note is described as a harsh, grating rattle, or a guttural ‘burrr’.</p><p>The male’s whistled song is variable, and sometimes contains mimicry, but is less varied than that of the Sentinel Rock Thrush, with which its range largely overlaps.

The contact call sounds like ‘slee-sloo’, and its alarm note is described as a harsh, grating rattle, or a guttural ‘burrr’.</p><p>These birds can become habituated and bold at popular viewing sites and picnic places alongside roads through spectacular gorges, such as are common in the Cape fold mountains. In rural regions, Cape Rock Thrushes become part of village life when human settlements are sited in or next to prime boulder-strewn habitat, the birds regularly foraging for prey or scraps around and among the dwellings. However, they have become scarce on the Cape Peninsula, having disappeared along all of the Peninsula’s scenic drives, where they were once regular roadside birds.</p><p>Most foraging takes place on the ground, where the birds move about quite fast. Their gait typically is a series of long hops, followed by a pause. Virtually any type of invertebrate prey is acceptable, and although insects and spiders are the forms most commonly encountered, they also eat snails, centipedes, and catch tiny vertebrates such as small frogs and lizards when they can. Sandwich crumbs and other scraps of human or animal food are popular variations when available, and they have also been observed scavenging carcass scraps at vulture ‘restaurants’. Not all food is obtained at ground level; insects may be gleaned from shrub and tree foliage, and small drupes and berries are occasionally plucked in situ. Like the Sentinel Rock Thrush, the Cape Rock Thrush is something of an aloe nectar addict and regularly supplements its diet in this way during the winter months when the Krantz Aloe Aloe arborescens (often a common plant in their favoured habitat), or other aloes such as A. ferox and A. spectabilis are in bloom.</p><p>Interestingly, I can find no mention of drinking or bathing behaviour in any text on Cape Rock Thrushes. Insectivorous birds usually obtain all the metabolic water they need from their prey, so they do not have to drink. But most bathe in water or in warm dust, or sunbathe on a regular basis.</p>",

Their grey-brown speckled plumage is not very distinctive, but when they take off the wings have large, light blue windows with a clear white line behind the blue. This transforms a rather drab bird into a very special duck. The male has yellow eyes and orange legs to distinguish him from the female.</p><p>They are found over much of southern Africa apart from the Kalahari and Namib Deserts.

Apparently this species may be partially migratory, but they appear to be more nomadic or resident.</p><p>They are found over much of southern Africa apart from the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They are strong, swift fliers and can be expected to pitch up in any pan which has been filled by rains. Apparently this species may be partially migratory, but they appear to be more nomadic or resident.</p><p>They are one of four species of ducks worldwide with the spatulate shoveler type bill. The Northern Shoveler is a migrant from Eurasia and is an occasional visitor to southern Africa. The other two species occur in Australasia and North America.</p><p>This species favours freshwater wetlands, but is known to utilise brackish wetlands when these are filled by seasonal rains. It is always one of the first ducks to exploit newly filled pans following extensive rains. These pans may get a ‘bloom’ of invertebrate plankton on which the shovelers feed, since its diet consists predominantly of animal matter, essentially small invertebrates. Feeding is usually done by swimming or walking along in shallow water with the beak open and immersed in the water. The bird’s beak is specially adapted for sifting food from the water. One unusual feeding method unique to shovelers is for a number of birds to swim in a circle, head to tail, so that the paddling action of the feet of the one in front stirs up the muddy water immediately in front of the next bird’s beak, thereby enabling them to glean and sift out the food which has been disturbed by the paddling. They have also been seen taking advantage of water stirred up by animals walking in shallow water.</p><p>In the southern Cape I have recorded that they often arrive within days on newly filled pans. However, they do not usually start breeding immediately but wait until the emergent vegetation provides some cover. Their breeding pattern is typical of the dabbling group of ducks. The birds have an intensive courtship period with vigorous aerial chases to prove the mettle of the males. The males are lighter and ‘cleaner’ than females at this stage, which is unusual in dabbling ducks in our region! They are monogamous nesters, normally with a short pair-bond period. The male guards the female attentively and defends her vigorously while she is building the nest in thick cover on the ground and while laying the eggs. However, most males desert the female soon after she starts incubating the eggs. Some males do, however, stand guard until the eggs have hatched and the ducklings have moved to the nearest water.</p><p>One of the most interesting features of this species’ nesting is that males defend territories against other shovelers, but because of the problems of predation, shovelers will nest on an island if one is available. Under these conditions, the number of females nesting on an island with suitable cover is often much larger than the number of males which can hold territory because of the limited space in the water around the island. The protection provided by an island is important enough for females to build nests within two metres of each other, whereas they are normally 30 or more metres apart in suitable habitat along the shore around Voëlvlei.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cape Siskin is confined to the fynbos vegetation of the southern mountains of South Africa from about Nieuwoudtville in the west to near Grahamstown in the east. It avoids the coastal vegetation of the west coast but tolerates dry habitats on the fringes of the semi-arid Karoo as long as there are at least stunted proteas in the vicinity. Many birders visiting the Little Karoo near Oudtshoorn are surprised to see siskins feeding in the parched veld between the red-coloured hills – it is the occurrence of scattered Wabome Protea nitida that is the attraction. The shrill notes, ‘pee-chee’, incorporated into the male Cape Siskin’s song led to earlier generations of birders calling them Peachy Canaries.</p><p>The choice of nest site is very strange for a canary – most of them nest in cavities in rocks and on cliffs. They usually choose a damp nesting spot, sometimes taking this preference to extremes. For many years a pair nested behind a waterfall near the Bain’s Kloof Pass in the Western Cape mountains, and in spite of suffering a few nests being flooded after late spring rains, they were generally successful at raising chicks. Similarly, at an overhang close to the Tradouw Pass near Swellendam, where thin streams of water cascade from above, siskins have bred successfully for decades on a ledge in this soggy environment. Apart from the occasional flooding, these are safe nesting sites because the slippery slopes surrounding the nest make access for predators difficult and even the most determined egg or chick thief would be defeated (except perhaps an African Harrier-Hawk).</p><p>The choice of nest site is very strange for a canary – most of them nest in cavities in rocks and on cliffs.

Several nests on the Anysberg, in the western Little Karoo, are less than two metres from the ground, on exposed rocks, with no attempt to hide the nest or to choose a sheltered site. At one nest near Rooiels on the False Bay coast, the female would arrive with nesting material and promptly settle on the nest in spite of the presence of observers – strangely accepting behaviour for what is normally a fairly wary species.</p><p>The alien pine plantations of the south-western Western Cape, especially where the undergrowth has been removed, do not support a rich diversity of birdlife. In recent decades, however, Cape Siskins have been discovered nesting in plantation trees, often far from their normal rocky breeding habitat. In the extensive Elgin pine plantations, the song of the male Cape Siskin is now one of the characteristic sounds during the breeding season.</p><p>The Cape Siskin is one of the fynbos endemics that has not been negatively affected by the excessive burning that has taken place in the mountains of the Western Cape. The reason for this is that they are not dependent on mature fynbos for breeding. Indeed, they are sometimes attracted to newly burnt ground where foraging flocks of more than 100 may form to feed on exposed seeds. It is interesting to note that the siskins usually form monospecific flocks and seldom join feeding parties of other canaries. It is one of the few species to feed in the alien Beefwood Grivillea striata trees that have been planted as windbreaks on so many farms throughout the Western Cape. This adaptability has ensured that their numbers have remained fairly stable and their former classification as Near-threatened seems to have been pessimistic.</p>",

They may also build them high up in Eucalyptus trees, or in the congestion of multiple wires at the top of a telephone pole. Their nests are large ball-shaped structures with a side entrance, and they are rather untidy, but there is an intriguing aspect to the interior decor, for they not only use feathers for lining, but also add fresh sprigs of aromatic herbs such as thyme, camphor and curry-scented plants. Sue Milton and Richard Dean investigated this habit and found that while Cape Sparrows are not the only birds to do this, they are the most consistent users of aromatic herbs. The function of such nest lining material is not fully understood, but it is possible that the volatile compounds released from the herbs by the warmth of the incubating bird may discourage infestation of the nest by parasitic mites.</p><p>The Cape Sparrow undoubtedly enjoys a better PR image than the alien House Sparrow except, perhaps, among vineyard owners of the Western and Northern Cape provinces. The costly consequence of a change of vineyard maintenance several decades ago (when it was found that weeds in vineyards prevented moisture evaporation by shading the soil) was that Cape Sparrows, attracted by weed seeds in the previously weed-free vineyards, discovered that grapes are delicious.</p><p>Being indigenous connotes a long period of availability as a potential host to brood parasites such as cuckoos. The Cape Sparrow is one of the favoured hosts of the Dideric Cuckoo. The sparrow has not been a complacent host, because the Dideric Cuckoos that parasitise them have had to develop a matching egg, quite different from those that are laid in the other favoured host nests of Southern Masked Weavers and Southern Red Bishops. The Cape Sparrow attracts some 25% of the known records of parasitism by Dideric Cuckoos of these three hosts. Viewed as the percentage of Cape Sparrow nests cuckolded by Dideric Cuckoos, however, the figure is only about 8.5%.</p>",

They seldom wander more than 75 metres from shelter to which they can retreat if threatened.</p><p>The only spurfowl with which they overlap is the Red-necked Spurfowl – the two species co-occur along the Garden Route from George to Port Elizabeth. The only francolin with which they overlap extensively is the Grey-winged Francolin. Cape Spurfowl are conspicuous and usually found in pairs or small coveys that are probably family groups, although as many as a dozen or more birds may feed together. When disturbed, they prefer to run with dark crown feathers raised, flying only when pressed. Although ever alert to pending danger, where they are accustomed to humans, as in camp sites and parks, they can be quite bold. In certain camp sites, such as at De Hoop Nature Reserve, West Coast National Park and in the Cederberg, they regularly approach humans and human dwellings to scavenge food, and will even feed from one’s hand.</p><p>Their overnight roosting sites are often in dense scrub, reed beds or patches of Palmiet reed in wetland sponges, where they huddle together on the ground. Along the coast, coveys can be seen flying across estuaries at last and first light, using the estuary as a barrier to terrestrial predators between their daily activity sites and their roosts. The advertisement call is a loud, crowing ‘kak-keek, kak-keek, kak-keeeeek’, with the second syllable accented, similar to that of the Natal Spurfowl, and is usually given in the early morning and late afternoon. Juvenile birds give a long, whistled contact call.</p><p>During the non-breeding season their diet consists of bulbs, corms, seeds, berries, fallen grain and the seeds of alien acacias. In the summer they take more snails, termites, ants and other invertebrates. They also feed on fallen fruits, including grapes, apples and pears.</p><p>Breeding is mostly between August and January, peaking in early summer. Pairing in spring sees males vigorously chasing each other to determine dominance. A victorious male will circle and approach a female with wings bowed and feathers puffed to induce her to pair with him. The nest is a scrape lined with grass and is usually well concealed in fynbos or under a bush. Although the clutch is usually 4-8 eggs, egg-dumping is commonplace and a single clutch can contain as many as 14 eggs, laid by two females. Chicks can fly short distances by the time they are 12 days old. On average, four chicks per brood survive to fledging.</p><p>This spurfowl benefits from habitat transformation by humans, through their ability to colonise alien vegetation and suburban parklands. However, their presence on farms depends on the placement, size and interconnectedness of patches of natural habitat and plantings of alien bush to provide safe nesting and roosting sites. This dependency is particularly evident on wheat, wine and deciduous fruit farms, where fynbos is fragmented into scattered patches along drainage lines and between crops. Because of this habitat fragmentation, the average home range on apple farms in the Elgin district of the Western Cape is 1.3 hectares, much larger than the home ranges of 0.3 hectares occupied in areas of extensive fynbos along the west coast.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cape Sugarbird is the most conspicuous of the fynbos endemics. The male, with his long flowing tail and jangling, churring call is hard to overlook. Like the Orange-breasted Sunbird, Cape Sugarbirds are very much winter breeders. In the Helderberg Nature Reserve near Somerset West, they arrive back at their chosen stand of proteas in late February and early March and their numbers gradually build up until April, by which time breeding is in full swing, coinciding with the flowering of proteas. The nest site is often in a stand of mature proteas, usually on a hillside. The males arrive at the breeding area first and, as they are highly territorial, there is much chasing and displaying to ward off potential rivals.</p><p>The nest is most frequently built in a protea bush but occasionally other plant species are chosen. One nest in the Helderberg Nature Reserve in Somerset West was built into a cluster of bracken and was virtually on the ground, but this is unusual. The male takes no part in the nest-building but he does help with the feeding of the nestlings. Most often two eggs are laid, sometimes only one. In the Silverboomkloof Natural Heritage site near Somerset West, one nest with three eggs was found. Not only is such a large clutch extremely rare, but three young were successfully raised from this nest.</p><p>The nest is most frequently built in a protea bush but occasionally other plant species are chosen.

In the Silverboomkloof Natural Heritage site near Somerset West, one nest with three eggs was found. Not only is such a large clutch extremely rare, but three young were successfully raised from this nest.</p><p>Most nesting is over by mid-August and numbers steadily dwindle until only a few stragglers are left at the breeding grounds. However, nesting is very much geared to the flowering of proteas, and a pair was seen feeding fledged young in early February in the Robinson Pass near Mossel Bay, when proteas were in full flower. In this case, egg-laying must have taken place in late December, which would be extraordinarily early for a breeding attempt in the south-western parts of the Western Cape.</p><p>After breeding, considerable dispersal takes place but this is not yet well understood. Certainly many sugarbirds enter suburban gardens during the dry summer months, and copses of eucalypts, especially spidergums, are also a great attraction. During the height of the summer, stands of flowering pincushions on the coast of the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve between Gordon’s Bay and Rooiels often teem with sugarbirds. There is also a movement to higher altitudes where, like Orange-breasted Sunbirds, they congregate in large numbers during the hottest months. Undoubtedly some sugarbirds move further afield although there is no evidence of regular, widespread movement. A bird ringed in Helderberg Nature Reserve was recaptured on the slopes of the Riviersonderend range above Greyton, 60 km to the east. Some journeys are longer than this, however: the longest-distance ring recovery was of a bird that had travelled 365 km. In January 1989 two sugarbirds were seen in a dry riverbed between the Anysberg and the Touwsberg in the Little Karoo.</p><p>A serious threat to the long-term survival of the Cape Sugarbird has become apparent in recent decades and it is one that conservation authorities need to address urgently. Sugarbirds are dependent on mature stands of proteas for breeding, but the frequent fires on the Western Cape mountains – both deliberate and accidental – are resulting in a dearth of mature fynbos. Birders who express concern about the gross over-burning of the veld often have their fears dismissed by botanists who point out that fires are a part of a natural cycle and are necessary for fynbos regeneration. Indeed they are, but this misses an important point. Sugarbirds require tall bushes in which to build their nests, and it can take 10 years or more after a fire before the vegetation reaches this stage of maturity.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cape Teal occurs in southern and eastern Sudan, southern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and southern Somalia. It is also found south through Zambia and may be found almost all over southern Africa apart from the Kalahari, but it is only common in Namibia (especially in the arid coastal strip), in the Western Cape and eastwards through the Karoo to Gauteng. They are a highly mobile and nomadic species which can appear on almost any wetland. However, they prefer shallow pans with brackish water with emergent vegetation.</p><p>This species has a uniformly grey speckled head and overall gives the impression of a grey-brown bird. The sexes are alike except that the males are slightly larger and brighter. They have a pink bill and bright red eyes, although eye colour can vary from red to orange and even brown. Compared to other ducks this species is relatively quiet, with the male making high-pitched whistles, while the female has a ‘nasal’ sounding quack.</p><p>This species has a uniformly grey speckled head and overall gives the impression of a grey-brown bird.

Compared to other ducks this species is relatively quiet, with the male making high-pitched whistles, while the female has a ‘nasal’ sounding quack.</p><p>The Cape Teal has an estimated population of 10 000 to 50&#160;000 in southern Africa. They gather in large groups numbering 2&#160;000 – 3&#160;000 birds on large permanent bodies of water for their annual moult, when all the flight feathers are dropped at the same time.</p><p>For feeding and breeding this species prefers open, often bare, saline or brackish wetlands and even tidal mudflats. They make little use of fast- or slow-flowing rivers or of ephemeral rivers and streams. In this environment they feed by swimming in shallow water with the beak at water level and filtering out food from the water. They also upend in deeper water and may even dive to feed on the muddy bottom. They feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates – these accounting for over 80% of the birds’ food. Vegetable matter forms the rest of their food intake.</p><p>As is typical of birds living in arid and semi-arid environments that are subject to erratic rain and sporadic droughts, the Cape Teal is an opportunistically breeding nomad, moving hundreds, and probably thousands of kilometres, in search of suitable habitat. Typically in the southern Cape there are always some resident Cape Teal – small numbers in permanent dams – but whenever we get really heavy rains which fill up all the dry pans, and in particular Voëlvlei on the Gouritz River floodplain, they appear in hundreds, and as soon as the vlei vegetation starts growing they start nesting, and within a month or two there are numerous families of Cape Teal on every pan.</p><p>One of the unusual features of this species is that the birds have an enduring pair bond. While many duck species change mates every season with the males taking little or no part in the rearing of the ducklings, it is thought that being already paired enables this species to take immediate advantage of suitable nesting conditions after rainfalls. Although the female Cape Teal builds the nest out of grass or other local vegetation in a well-concealed position in waterside plants, she is usually accompanied by the male. She adds large numbers of downy feathers (over 2&#160;000 counted in some nests), as well as some larger contour feathers. While she is incubating the eggs, the male is nearby, keeping watch. Once the ducklings hatch, he accompanies the female and ducklings as they forage in shallow water, always on the alert for danger to the chicks. This species will always nest on islands if these are available, otherwise any dense vegetation near the water can be used. They also occasionally utilise thick emergent vegetation so that the nest is over deeper water. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Cape Turtle Doves are found almost all over southern Africa, but not in the southern Namib Desert where they may be excluded by the lack of trees, rather than by the aridity. Elsewhere, they occur from western Somalia and Ethiopia south and west to southern DRC, and from there south to the Cape. The species occurs in a wide range of rainfall regimes, from areas classified as ‘deserts’, such as the Succulent and Nama Karoo, the Kalahari Desert and parts of the Namib Desert, to high-rainfall areas such as the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, the KwaZulu-Natal coast and the southern parts of the Western Cape Province. This range of rainfall regimes within its southern African distribution is reflected in the number of subspecies that occur here: across the species’ entire range six subspecies have been described, and five of these are found in southern Africa. Cape Turtle Doves from the arid zone are markedly paler (a feature of birds living in arid areas) than the birds of the more mesic habitats.</p><p>The Cape Turtle Dove is found in almost any woodland, including open and closed savanna woodland and dense riverine woodland. The species is common to fairly common everywhere in its southern African range: it is certainly the commonest large dove in drainage-line woodlands in the Karoo. Its tolerance to habitat transformation is high: it is common in open farmlands with scattered trees, in parks and gardens in towns and villages, in pine and eucalyptus plantations, and in alien Port Jackson Willow Acacia saligna and Rooikrans A. cyclops thickets in the Western Cape. Indeed, in the Western Cape, most nests of this species have been found in alien trees. In Zimbabwe, by contrast, most nests are constructed in indigenous trees. The nest is a typical dove nest – a frail, saucer-shaped platform of twigs and petioles, lined with grass or rootlets. The birds frequently use old nests of other doves, as well as those of egrets, thrushes and sparrows.</p><p>The Cape Turtle Dove is found in almost any woodland, including open and closed savanna woodland and dense riverine woodland.

The birds are usually seen alone, or in pairs, sometimes in groups or flocks when foraging, and frequently in small to large groups at desert water holes. They drink at any time of day in arid and semi-arid areas, but mainly in the early morning and late afternoon with birds arriving alone or in pairs. They perch on trees and bushes as close to the water as possible and, when small groups have assembled, several fly down to the water together, drink quickly and fly up again. It is thought that this is a tactic to minimise predation, but Peregrine, Red-necked and Lanner Falcons have their own tactics to maximise their success, and all three falcons regularly capture Cape Turtle Doves at these water holes.</p><p>Cape Turtle Doves forage on the ground in open patches. At Harkerville, near Knysna, Cape Turtle Doves foraged on lands ploughed up to reap potatoes, but only three months after the potato harvest when the land had been smoothed out. The birds associate with other doves in foraging flocks, especially at grain spillages. Their food is almost entirely seeds of a wide range of indigenous and alien plants, including cultivated crops. They also eat small bulbs of Yellow Nutgrass (Cyperus esculentus), fruits of alien firethorns (Pyracantha species) and Cherry-pie (Lantana camara), leaves of succulent plants, and nectar from aloes. Invertebrates also contribute to the diet, including earthworms, termites, weevils, aphids and locust hoppers.&#9;</p>",

My introduction to vultures was during one very memorable August school holiday when I was invited to stay with a friend in Johannesburg. We were both keen ringers and accompanied the Wits Bird Club to a Cape Vulture colony in the Magaliesberg to ring vulture chicks. This involved walking along ledges on a cliff, trying not to get covered with partially digested food vomited up by the chicks! Since then I have had the pleasure of watching Cape Vultures in the southern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Kruger, the Magaliesberg and Blouberg, as well as the southern parts of Zimbabwe and in eastern Botswana.</p><p>The Cape Vulture is a large vulture, almost as large as the Lappet-faced Vulture and noticeably bigger than the rather similar looking White-backed Vulture. As an adult it is a pale coloured vulture with a blue-grey head covered with white fluff. The eyes are yellow and the wings show scalloped primary coverts. The juvenile is darker and quite variable but usually has a purplish-coloured head covered with more fluff than the adult. They are in many ways quite similar to the juvenile White-backed Vultures.</p><p>The Cape Vulture is a large vulture, almost as large as the Lappet-faced Vulture and noticeably bigger than the rather similar looking White-backed Vulture.

The juvenile is darker and quite variable but usually has a purplish-coloured head covered with more fluff than the adult. They are in many ways quite similar to the juvenile White-backed Vultures.</p><p>The Cape Vulture is a southern African endemic which breeds on various cliffs across the region with the main population in the Magaliesberg, the Blouberg area of Limpopo Province and the Drakensberg Highlands. The birds occur in a number of isolated colonies as well, but these are minor groups compared to the larger colonies.   However, its numbers have decreased drastically over the last fifty or so years and it is now an endangered species despite a lot of work being done to try and save the species from extinction.</p><p>The birds are scavengers which gather in numbers at carcasses of large mammals.  Originally they probably relied almost entirely on kills by large predators such as lions.  Today they have to rely on dead farm animals in many areas because wild animals have disappeared. Due to modern animal husbandry, however, dead animals are seldom left in the veld.</p><p>During the day the birds fly at a considerable height above the ground keeping in sight of one another so that, should one bird spot a potential food source and start spiralling down to the carcass, other birds will see it and follow it down. Sometimes these carcasses have been deliberately poisoned in order to kill scavengers such as jackals, but the poison also kills the vultures. In one seven-year period 227 Cape Vultures were killed in 16 poisoning incidents. The vultures may also be killed for use in the traditional medicine trade. Collisions with power transmission lines are another frequent cause of mortality.</p><p>At a carcass these birds are large enough to dominate all other vulture species apart from the Lappet-faced Vulture, which is noticeably larger and more aggressive.  Sometimes the Cape Vultures and the smaller vultures have to wait for a carcass to be opened up by the larger Lappet-faced Vultures or by mammalian scavengers. Once feeding starts, the birds feed extremely rapidly because the whole flock feeds at the same time, and it has been recorded that they can fill their crop, which then bulges out with the skin stretched taut, in about five minutes.</p><p>The birds build stick nests on cliff ledges. If the ledges are suitable, nests may be as close as two metres apart, but are usually further apart than that. On some cliffs the ledges are much smaller and often only large enough to hold a single vulture’s nest, and so the nests are more scattered than they are in the Magaliesberg and Blouberg.</p>",

These are usually small insects that have alighted on the water surface, become trapped by surface tension, and eventually blown ashore.

Cat-free houses can also provide good pickings to habituated wagtail couples. While visiting a friend one morning, two Cape Wagtails came walking in off the deck. They proceeded to the couch to pick up all the biscuit crumbs dropped on the carpet at tea time, then headed for the breakfast table floor where they ardently gleaned toast fragments and other dropped delicacies. Then they walked out. No fuss, no noise; a proficient clean-up team!</p><p>Small though they are, weighing only about 20 grams, these are feisty birds. A pair nested one year on our ivy-covered garage wall. Nest-building, egg-laying, incubation, hatching and feeding of three nestlings all proceeded normally until the chicks were about a week old. Then one of the adults disappeared; the female’s corpse was found at the roadside, evidently a victim of collision with a car. The male proved a competent single parent, because frequent inspection showed the nestlings’ daily development to be unimpaired. A couple of days before the chicks would have fledged, wagtail distress calls claimed my attention, and I ran out to find a large Boomslang Dispholidus typus at the nest. I hauled the snake away from the nest and tossed her (‘her’ based on proportions and colouration) into the vegetation on the opposite side of the garage, noting that she had two bulges in her.</p><p>The nest was empty, so there was a chance that one chick had abandoned ship before being swallowed. Indeed it had, for a while later a fresh outburst from the adult begged attention. I saw the Boomslang evidently searching for the escapee on the sandy ground of the neighbouring plot. Father wagtail was putting on a vigorous distraction display, fluttering about on the ground as though injured, and the snake almost caught him a couple of times. I intervened again, shepherding the snake back to the vlei edge before returning to look for the chick. I found it motionless on the ground, only a metre from where the snake had been distracted by the parent. I tried to pick it up, but it fluttered away over the ground toward our garden. I followed, but was immediately confronted by the irate parent wagtail which landed in front of me and advanced with wings spread defiantly. The chick meanwhile reached the concealing cover of our garden and hid under a rhubarb plant. It was fed there by its father for several more days until it was confident and competent to follow him to another site. All of which goes to show that there is more to Cape Wagtails than one might expect.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The bill of the Cape Weaver is long and pointed, though thick at the base, indicating a generalist feeder rather than a specialist seedeater. Cape Weavers take fruit, nectar, pollen, and a wide range of invertebrate animals as well as seeds. They seem to be the chief pollinators of Crane Flowers Strelitzia reginae, and may also be important in pollinating winter-flowering aloes in some areas.This species is endemic to the cooler, wetter areas of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, and is often common within this region, even ranking as a minor pest of grain crops and orchards in the Western Cape.</p><p>There is some regional variation in male plumage, with eastern birds tending to have more orange-brown feathers around the face, but there is no apparent separation of the populations. Breeding males have a black bill. Outside the breeding season their bills turn horn-brown and they lose the intense yellow breeding plumage and the orange-brown wash around the face. The pale eye is generally characteristic of males only, though there are some records of females (perhaps old birds?) with pale rather than brown irides. Most females breed in the first season after hatching, whereas males first acquire adult plumage and breed after two years.</p><p>There is some regional variation in male plumage, with eastern birds tending to have more orange-brown feathers around the face, but there is no apparent separation of the populations.

Most females breed in the first season after hatching, whereas males first acquire adult plumage and breed after two years.</p><p>Cape Weavers are highly polygynous. Males establish small territories clustered together where each builds a series of nests. Most colonies form in reed beds or large trees, often favouring gum trees (Eucalyptus) planted at farm homesteads.In areas where such sites are not available, they occasionally resort to using power or telephone lines. The males display to any passing female, fluttering their wings and calling their distinctive song, often while suspended from the entrance to a nest. The harsh chattering song consists of a long series of similar notes, finally tailing off almost as if the male has run out of breath. With luck and persistence one male may attract up to seven mates in the course of the season.</p><p>The nest is a bulky structure, rather coarsely woven, either suspended from the tip of a branch of a tree, or supported by two or more vertical reeds or bulrushes. Most of the leaves are removed from plants supporting the nest, presumably to make it harder for predators such as snakes to reach the nests. The nest entrance is on the underside, and lacks an entrance tunnel. Unused nests may be demolished by the male. The female is solely responsible for incubation and usually for feeding the chicks when they hatch; males generally avoid any parental duties, but occasionally feed nestlings, or fledglings once they have left the nest. Cape Weavers are parasitised by Dideric Cuckoos, and male weavers attack any cuckoos that approach a colony. They are seldom brood hosts in the winter rainfall area, however, because they have completed breeding before the migratory cuckoos arrive in the region.</p><p>Large roosts are occupied each evening by non-breeding birds, often in association with other weaver species or with Pied, Wattled or Common Starlings. The oldest Cape Weaver on record is a bird ringed as an adult male in breeding plumage in my Grahamstown garden, and recaptured there 13 years 8 months later.  Since males do not breed until their second year, he would then have been at least 15 years old; he weighed exactly the same as on first capture! An analysis of recaptures of ringed birds in the Western Cape suggests that Cape Weavers move further and on average survive for shorter periods than Masked Weavers in the same region. The Eastern Cape might be different in this respect.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>There are over 70 species of white-eyes worldwide, mainly in Africa, Asia and Australasia. At least three of these are known or thought to be extinct and two were first discovered as recently as 2008. The Cape White-eye is a common and widespread species over much of the southern and eastern parts of South Africa. Two races are currently recognised – Zosterops c.virens and Z. c. capensis. The latter grey-bellied race occurs in the west, overlapping with the green-bellied race in the Eastern Cape, where interbreeding between the two is a common occurrence. Possible hybridisation with Orange River White-eyes has been reported in the Free State. In the Elgin district of the Western Cape several white-eyes with traces of chestnut couloration on their flanks have been seen, but the calls of these birds are typical of Cape White-eye rather than Orange River White-eye.</p><p>Cape White-eyes are found in a wide range of habitats from suburban gardens, relict tracts of indigenous forest, alien acacias and even into semi-arid landscapes where they follow belts of Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo into the heart of the Great Karoo. The planting of alien trees around homesteads, and the spread of these into adjacent areas, must have done much to allow them to expand their range into otherwise unsuitable areas. Ringing has shown that they are largely sedentary, with most recoveries less than 5 km from the ringing site and the farthest being 164 km away. One Cape White-eye was recovered 12 years and 8 months after ringing – a good age for such a small bird.</p><p>Cape White-eyes are found in a wide range of habitats from suburban gardens, relict tracts of indigenous forest, alien acacias and even into semi-arid landscapes where they follow belts of Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo into the heart of the Great Karoo.

One Cape White-eye was recovered 12 years and 8 months after ringing – a good age for such a small bird.</p><p>White-eyes are often (together with Olive Thrushes and Cape Robin-Chats) the first birds to sing in the morning. In central Somerset West white-eyes sing well before first light, and one wonders how much they are influenced by the widespread use of security lights which mean that they never experience total darkness.</p><p>Generally, white-eyes are popular garden birds. They feed on a wide variety of insects, berries, nectar and fruit and, provided that a garden is planted primarily to propa&#173;gate flowers, they do little damage. Fruit growers will be less pleased as these birds can cause extensive damage to soft fruits such as figs, apricots and grapes. The Wild Olive Olea europaea subsp. africana, when in fruit, is a great attraction and white-eyes often gather on the ground below the trees, eating fallen fruit. The Coastal Coral Tree Erythrina caffra is another favourite, and white-eyes often mingle with different sunbird species at this rich source of nectar. Aphids form an important part of their diet and roses, which are particularly adversely affected by these pests, are often given a thorough going-over by parties of white-eyes. Perhaps gardeners will see this as compensation for any other damage that they might cause!</p><p>For such a tiny bird, the call is loud and far-carrying. During the spring and summer breeding season the song of the Cape White-eye is hard to miss, and in the dense Knysna Forest it is often the only sound to be heard during the heat of the day. White-eyes are not the best of mimics but nevertheless a careful listener will pick out snatches of other birds’ calls in their songs.</p><p>Being small, Cape White-eyes are vulnerable to many predators and they occasionally fall prey to Common Fiscals, Southern Boubous and Fork-tailed Drongos: there are even records of them being caught in spiders’ web.</p>",

They are found on dry grassy plains, particularly in areas where overgrazing has occurred and there is not much ground cover. They are one of the first species to arrive when a grassy area has been burned. In Marondera they usually appear shortly after a burn and then often nest immediately after arriving.</p><p>Unlike many of our chat family, this species is very distinctively marked. The birds have a black crown leading to black on the back of the head. They have a white forehead with a white line running backwards above the eye, separating a black cap from a black cheek. The black cheek extends downwards and round in a broad black bib across the chest, with a clean white chin and throat. Below the black bib the birds are white, grading into a rufous colour. The back and wings are a brownish colour, and the tail is distinctively marked white at the top and black at the end.</p><p>Unlike many of our chat family, this species is very distinctively marked.

However, if the bird has its back to the observer it is much more difficult to spot because the back is a rather nondescript colour and often matches the bare ground on which they occur. They often perch on stones or bushes or particularly fence posts or isolated bushes, from which they can watch the ground below for movement of insects. They will drop off a perch onto prey below or will walk across the ground in search of prey. It is noticeable that when they leave a perch and fly off to another perch, they drop down and fly almost skimming the ground and then up onto the next perch, where they will often bob their heads and their tails on landing, the black and white markings standing out clearly again when doing so.</p><p>The birds have a very varied song, with whistles and trills being put together in fairly random fashion. It is also well known as a mimic of other birds found in the same habitat.</p><p>They eat a variety of ground-dwelling invertebrates, including termites, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, grasshoppers and various bugs and beetles.</p><p>Capped Wheatears occur in pairs, particularly during the breeding season, and when one sees more than a pair of birds together, it usually means that the fledglings of that year are still with the adults. The fledged young are somewhat barred and so can be differentiated from the adults. Rodent burrows are favoured as nest sites, but I have found them nesting in holes excavated by other birds in banks. They build a pad of dry grass and other plant material in which two or three eggs are laid. Although we often found them nesting in spring, they also nested at any time of the year if an area had been burned or heavily grazed. The chicks come to the entrance of the burrow to be fed when they are preparing to leave the nest. Once the chicks are fully feathered they come out and accompany the parents around the territory until they are ready to become independent.&#9;</p>",

The red colour on the head of the male Cardinal Woodpecker extends from just behind the forehead, down the back of the head to the nape, whereas the female has a black crown and nape; otherwise the sexes are similar in appearance.

The Cardinal Woodpecker resembles a diminutive Bearded Woodpecker, but has striped, not barred, underparts.</p><p>Cardinal Woodpeckers can be found in any woodland and even in the forests of the southern Cape. In drier areas they occur in the gallery woodlands along river beds, allowing them to range well into the Karoo in many areas. The birds occupy a territory throughout the year, and my experience in the Miombo woodland of Zimbabwe is that the pair will join a mixed-species bird party when the party enters the pair’s territory. However, once the bird party moves on, the pair of Cardinal Woodpeckers remains within their own territory.</p><p>This species spends most of its day ‘digging’ in wood, and its fairly rapid tapping frequently draws attention to the bird. Although they may start feeding near the bottom of a tree, seeking insects in cracks in the bark, they do most of their foraging in the canopy or subcanopy where they can dig in the thin, dead branches. They often feed on branches which are too thin for other woodpeckers in the same woodlands to feed on. It is interesting to watch Cardinal Woodpeckers looking for food, even hanging on the underside of branches with their tail braced against the branch, pecking potential prey sites. The birds peck open the holes made by boring grubs in the wood and insert their tongue, which has a barb or hook on the end to spear the grub and extract it from the hole. On trees which have rough bark or plenty of lichen, they also feed on insects hiding in the bark or lichen.</p><p>The birds have a number of distinctive calls, the most obvious being the rattling call given by both male and female to advertise their territory. This is usually described as ‘krii-krii’, repeated about six times. The male also drums on a dead branch, which acts as a sounding board to send the sound out over its territory.</p><p>Cardinal Woodpeckers excavate a small nest hole in a dead branch in spring. The hole is about 40&#160;mm in diameter. I have found nests as low as one metre from the ground and as high as 30 metres above the ground, but most nests are less than three metres from the ground, and most are excavated in the underside of a sloping branch, which presumably helps to keep water out of the nest when it rains. Like all the woodpeckers, they lay plain white eggs which hatch into chicks which are blind and naked initially. This species is one of a number of species parasitised by the Lesser Honeyguide, and it may also be parasitised by the Scaly-throated Honeyguide on occasion. At one nest where I photographed this species it appeared that during the day the female did more of the incubation than the male and that he would frequently deliver food to her at the nest. However, once the chicks hatched both birds had their time cut out obtaining sufficient food to feed the growing chicks.</p>",

In behaviour, Carp’s Tit is very similar to the Southern Black Tit, and is usually seen moving restlessly through the canopy of trees in pairs or small groups.

Like several other tern species, it has a very fragmented distribution, ranging from North America, through Europe, Africa and Australasia. In Africa there are two isolated populations, one in far West Africa and one in southern Africa.</p><p>The southern birds are isolated from all other populations and, once mature, they tend to be fairly sedentary, ranging only short distances from their natal area. Most of this movement is of an adult accompanying its young of the year from the breeding grounds to a nursery area where the young bird may remain for several years. The longest movements appear to be those of birds breeding in the Eastern Cape, with these birds dispersing north as far as southern Mozambique. Also mobile, those breeding in the Cape Agulhas area spread along the coastline as far as the Eastern Cape.</p><p>The southern birds are isolated from all other populations and, once mature, they tend to be fairly sedentary, ranging only short distances from their natal area.

Coastal populations may temporarily relocate inland when conditions are suitable. Only 14 breeding localities are known in southern Africa, and the total number of breeding birds is probably in the range of 600-700 pairs. They may breed solitarily or, more frequently, in colonies ranging from a couple of pairs to well over a hundred. In colonies, which may comprise loose or tight-knit groups, the birds are very defensive of their nests, especially when breeding in association with predatory Kelp Gulls. The females remain in constant vigil and the males, when not out fishing, sometimes form a defensive ring around the nesting area with their bills pointing outwards. Not even Kelp Gulls approach the terns’ nests – the sturdy, spear-shaped bills of the terns would wreak havoc with a gull!</p><p>Most foraging takes place in estuaries and lagoons, where mullet are the favoured prey. Regular observations of a breeding pair outside Swakopmund showed that the male was the provider for the chicks and only assumed guard duty in the evening to allow his mate to go hunting for herself. One, occasionally two, young, are reared: these may remain with one parent for up to a year; this important, long-term investment in rearing the young means that some pairs may only manage to breed every other year. The young themselves take a long time to reach maturity and may not breed until they are more than six years old. However, because the adults may live to at least 30 years they can afford the time to ensure that those young that have made it to fledging are well schooled for their future survival and breeding.</p><p>During the earlier part of the breeding season colonies should not be disturbed, because the adults fly off readily, keeping their distance from humans, staying high and calling persistently. This gives predators such as gulls the opportunity to nip in quickly and take eggs or small young.</p><p>When on the ground, Caspian Terns tend to associate only loosely with other terns and seemingly prefer the company of Kelp Gulls. At such times they are easy to identify by their size, large red bills and dark wedges at the wing tips.</p>",

Their flight is noticeably slower than the two smaller flycatchers.</p><p>They seem to be separated from the Pale Flycatcher by habitat and to a certain extent from the Marico Flycatcher as well. My experience in the Kalahari suggests that this species frequents the more open country with bushes, rather than with trees and woodland. They seem to prefer the open ground between the bushes when characteristically hunting from a low perch. However, in the Kalahari they are sometimes recorded in open woodlands as well. Chat Flycatchers are widespread and common in many parts of the Karoo, especially the Nama Karoo where this bird’s habit of sitting on top of bushes makes it a conspicuous member of the avifauna.</p><p>They seem to be separated from the Pale Flycatcher by habitat and to a certain extent from the Marico Flycatcher as well.

Chat Flycatchers are widespread and common in many parts of the Karoo, especially the Nama Karoo where this bird’s habit of sitting on top of bushes makes it a conspicuous member of the avifauna.</p><p>This species is essentially an insect eater which pounces on prey on the ground from a perch on a bush or small tree. I have watched them hawking termite alates when a hatch occurs in summer, but here again they will also drop onto the ground and catch the alates as they appear at the surface from their underground nest. The birds glide down from their perch and sometimes land a short distance from their prey, before hopping forward to grab the insect on the ground. Usually, if the insect is small it is devoured immediately, but larger insects may be carried back to the perch, before being consumed. The birds eat a variety of insect prey and are known to eat the harvester termites which forage actively during the day. They also consume grasshoppers. There is an interesting record of a small Blind Snake being consumed by one of these birds.</p><p>One gets the impression that the Chat Flycatchers are generally silent, but in fact when they are breeding following rainfall, they utter a quiet song consisting of a variety of chirrs and cheeps given in fairly rapid succession. Sometimes a group of three or four birds assemble briefly and noisily, shouting the odds in harsh notes, perhaps disputing a territorial boundary. A pair may keep in contact with a soft but far-carrying ‘irrioo’ call, which is repeated a number of times. When alarmed, a bird will sit in a conspicuous position and give a loud buzzing ‘kzzt kzzt kzzt’ call which may be taken up by the other member of the pair.</p><p>Although this species is found in open country with low-growing shrubs and bushes, it builds a remarkably large bulky nest, usually in the middle of a small bush. One has to wonder whether the large well-lined nest is more conspicuous than it needs to be, but I presume that it is important for keeping the chicks warm, as this species will nest at any time of the year following good rains in an area. During the winter months the nights can be very cold after the rain clouds have cleared, and the chicks could therefore be at risk at such times. These flycatchers usually lay two or three eggs which hatch after about fifteen days, then the chicks spend at least another two weeks in the nest before they fledge and start moving away into the surrounding bushes, accompanied by the adults.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Chestnut-backed Sparrow-Lark is a very widespread species in Africa and occurs across the northern half of southern Africa apart from Mozambique. It is a bird which is subject to a lot of local movement, and numbers of birds in different areas vary from year to year. In some years, in the Marondera area on the Zimbabwean plateau, the birds would suddenly appear in very large numbers; breed, and then almost as quickly disappear again.</p><p>These are small larks with a very marked conical bill, one that is well able to deal with the seeds on which they feed. The male is a beautiful chestnut colour on the back and wings, has a black head and a very noticeable white cheek and ear. The bill is usually white when breeding. The female is much less brightly-coloured because the chestnut-brown on the back is paler than that of the male. The female’s head is grey, and both sexes have a black belly.</p><p>These are small larks with a very marked conical bill, one that is well able to deal with the seeds on which they feed.

The female is much less brightly-coloured because the chestnut-brown on the back is paler than that of the male. The female’s head is grey, and both sexes have a black belly.</p><p>Due to their small size, they are easily overlooked while foraging on the ground for seed. However, because they are usually in flocks, when they are disturbed the whole flock flies up together and is, therefore, conspicuous. At this point the black belly is also easily noticed and helps to identify this species. At times they are so numerous that the flocks contain hundreds, and when foraging, the open ground surface appears to be moving because the birds are so close together. They are usually found in short, open grasslands or in open areas within woodland savanna. They also move into burned areas to glean insects disturbed after a fire.</p><p>The birds breed in fairly close association with one another. Although the pairs are monogamous, the nests can be close together, resulting in many nests in a relatively limited area. This is probably due to the presence of a plentiful food supply in the area chosen for nesting. The nest is a fairly deep cup in a hollow up against a small bush or grass tuft.  The nests are made of fine bits of grass or similar material and the top of the nest spreads out about a centimetre or two onto the surrounding soil. All the nests which I have seen were placed on the south side of the grass tuft or bush so as to be protected from the sun to the north.</p><p>During the day both male and female incubate the eggs and brood the small chicks, but apparently the female does the night shift incubation on her own. The eggs have a relatively short incubation period with eleven days being recorded in one instance. The chicks are fed by both male and female, and at a nest where I photographed this species, the birds alternated with feeding and both did approximately the same amount of work. It was interesting that they brought mainly insects, particularly small grasshoppers, with their back legs and wings removed, so that the food was quite soft. It was noticeable that the birds would bring food many times for ten to twenty minutes, and would then disappear for the next ten to thirty minutes. Apparently the adults also feed seeds to the chicks by regurgitation, but I did not notice this while photographing from about two metres away.  It was conspicuous that the birds were not only present in large numbers, but that there were a lot of small chicks moving around in the area once they had fledged. When approached, these chicks merely dived for the nearest cover and lay absolutely still as one walked past.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the smallest and most attractive of our resident plovers. The race occurring here (nominate pallidus) is endemic to southern Africa, extending marginally into southern Angola. There is another isolated race at saline wetlands in Kenya and Tanzania. Although breeding sites in southern Africa are rather few in number, some popu&#173;lations have to be very mobile because their favoured breeding wetlands are prone to drying up for long periods at a time, often for years.</p><p>The major breeding sites are at Etosha Pan in Namibia and the Makgadikgadi Pan complex of Botswana. Breeding in natural habitats also occurs at pan systems of the Free State and Northern Cape. In coastal Namibia and the Cape Provinces, however, they breed almost exclusively at man-made saltworks. Indeed, these artificial habitats have allowed the species to increase its range and possibly increase in overall abundance. Saltworks have also provided seasonal refuges for those populations that breed at ephemeral inland wetlands – the saltworks at Walvis Bay, and to a lesser extent Swakopmund, are important in this regard.</p><p>The major breeding sites are at Etosha Pan in Namibia and the Makgadikgadi Pan complex of Botswana.

Saltworks have also provided seasonal refuges for those populations that breed at ephemeral inland wetlands – the saltworks at Walvis Bay, and to a lesser extent Swakopmund, are important in this regard.</p><p>The Namibian population appears to fluctuate from around 6&#160;000 to over 15&#160;000 birds. This may be caused by breeding success, or lack thereof because of drought, at the huge inland pan systems where most breeding occurs. An overall population of between 11&#160;000 to 16&#160;000 is likely to be a fairly good estimate for the region as a whole.</p><p>The majority of the birds from the great inland pans in the north move to the Namibian coast when the pans dry out, but a small number may also move to the coasts of Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal, although these movements appear to have become less in recent years. It is also likely that those from the smaller natural salt pans in the interior of South Africa move to the coast in drought periods.</p><p>This plover is classified as Near-threatened on the IUCN Red List due to its dependence on the relatively few wetlands and potential future threats to some of this area. Counter-balancing this, however, are the benefits the species has derived from the growth of the salt-extraction industry.</p><p>This is our only resident Charadrius plover that is sexually dimorphic in plumage. The female generally lacks black and chestnut markings on the head, and her breast band is much paler than that of the male. The young lack all chestnut colouration and are rather pale, nondescript grey on the upperparts with a diffuse grey band across the upper breast. It is also the only one of our small plovers that habitually forages in flocks outside the breeding season.</p><p>Chestnut-banded Plovers are opportunistic breeders. Breeding may occur at any time of year but the peak periods are March to October in Namibia, July to October in the Northern Cape and November and December in the Western Cape. The nest is a small scrape in bare, open ground, in which usually two eggs are laid. The nest is often situated near a small plant, offering some meagre form of shade, or adjacent to stones that break up the sitting bird’s outline. The breeding territory is maintained until the young have fledged but may be extended if a second nesting attempt is made. Because of the extremely high temperatures where they breed, the female – who does most of the daytime incubation – soaks her belly feathers before returning to the nest, using the damp feathers to wet the eggs. In very hot weather she may also stand over the eggs, offering shade, rather than incubating.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The call of the Chestnut-vented Tit-Babbler is one of the characteristic sounds of southern Africa’s dry savanna woodlands. Near-endemic to the region, it occurs from about south-central Angola south and east to South Africa, with a mainly western distribution. The birds are absent from the higher rainfall areas of Zimbabwe Region, Namibia, north central Botswana, northern and south-eastern Zimbabwe, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Provinces, and almost completely absent from Mozambique. Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers occur on edges of thickets in drainage-line woodlands in savanna, in semi-arid shrublands next to woodlands, favouring taller vegetation than Layard’s Tit-Babbler in areas where they overlap. However, the Chestnut-vented Tit-Babbler is found on bushy hillsides where Layard’s Tit-Babbler is absent. The birds occur in gardens of farmsteads and in rural villages, where they are tame and confiding, although they are more often heard than seen.</p><p>At our Karoo farm nursery in Prince Albert, Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers forage in nursery plants and nest in scattered bushes between rows of stock plants. One nest at the nursery was in a honey-thorn bush (Lycium) on the edge of a shaded spot, popu&#173;lar with our staff for eating breakfast and lunches. Another nest was immediately adjacent to stocks of plants and seedlings, both of which needed regular watering. The birds were completely unconcerned by the presence of people, and carried on with their nesting activities, incubating eggs, feeding and raising chicks.</p><p>At our Karoo farm nursery in Prince Albert, Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers forage in nursery plants and nest in scattered bushes between rows of stock plants.

The birds were completely unconcerned by the presence of people, and carried on with their nesting activities, incubating eggs, feeding and raising chicks.</p><p>Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers are territorial and monogamous, with nests at least 50 metres from neighbouring pairs. Territorial boundaries are probably maintained by song – a loud, melodious piping and bubbling, interspersed with ‘chrrr’ or ‘cherik-tik’. They also utter a subsong that includes frequent and precise mimicry of calls of other bird species. However, the most frequently heard call, a sharp ‘cherrrik-tik-tik’, often answered by another bird, may simply be a communication call.</p><p>The nest is a rather flimsy cup of grass, roots, strips of silky bark from Lammerlat (Gomphocarpus filifolius) and spider web, lined with plant down and rootlets or hair, bound with spider web. Spider web is also used to bind the nest to a fork in the slender branches of an understorey shrub or small tree, sometimes in a clump of mistletoe, sometimes on the end of a down-sloping branch of a large tree within about a metre of the ground. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, and the birds can be lifted from the nest with a finger to inspect nest contents; they return immediately to incubating or brooding nestlings. Both parents feed the nestlings, initially mostly the male, while the female broods the young; later, when the nestlings are just over a week old, both bring food. Caterpillars are the only nestling food that has been recorded.</p><p>When the Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers forage, they move quickly and restlessly through branches and foliage of bushes and small trees, gleaning food mostly from bare branches, occasionally from leaves. A wide range of food items are eaten, including invertebrates such as adult and larval lepidoptera, mantids, small beetles and their larvae, ants and termites, seeds, small fruits and nectar of aloes. Ticks hiding under the bark of trees are extracted and eaten. Termite alates are hawked in the air, but eaten on a perch.&#9;</p>",

This pattern is however repeated in several animal groups, and suggests that in the past there was a belt of arid country linking these two regions. Like many other savanna weavers, the Chestnut Weaver is highly colonial, with up to 100 nests in a single tree. Nest sites are large trees in open grassland. The nest is built by the male, and typically has a short entrance tunnel pointing downwards; when the female has accepted a nest and mated with the owner, she will add a lining of grass seedheads. The males are generally polygynous, but their involvement in the breeding cycle is quite brief since they leave the colony while the females are incubating. The females are left to raise the young unaided. Red-headed Finches may displace female Chestnut Weavers from occupied nests. In some parts of Namibia, Chestnut Weavers are apparently resident, but most populations seem to be migratory. There is a recent record of this species from the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa. Non-breeding birds flock and roost with other weavers, and they seem to have a particular association with the Red-billed Quelea.</p>",

It is usually found in pairs, sometimes in small groups of two or three males and one female, or two females and one male. Groups with multiple ‘females’ may be family parties, because in all batis species immature birds have female plumage patterns.</p><p>The Chinspot Batis is a very active little bird, darting here and there in the crown of a tree, often hovering to glean some caterpillar from the foliage, or hawking flying insects. Unlike many canopy feeders, these birds are not averse to foraging on the ground (for as long as half an hour) if the takings there make it worthwhile. They are regular members of mixed-species foraging flocks, and are one of the first species to find and mob a roosting owl.</p><p>The Chinspot Batis is a very active little bird, darting here and there in the crown of a tree, often hovering to glean some caterpillar from the foliage, or hawking flying insects.

They are regular members of mixed-species foraging flocks, and are one of the first species to find and mob a roosting owl.</p><p>This batis is the most vocally conspicuous of its kindred species in southern Africa. The male has a remarkably loud voice for his diminutive size and his descending, three-syllable whistled call, popularly and appropriately transcribed ‘three blind mice’, is one of the dominant calls of woodland and thornveld on sunny mornings. Sometimes the call is uttered twice, making up six syllables. The female often snaps her beak in accompaniment to the male’s call. While on the hunt for food and separated by foraging activities, a pair maintains contact with a ‘tsip-tsip’ call.</p><p>The territory size defended by this batis has been estimated at some five hectares. In areas where the species is common, foraging pairs or groups are frequently involved in encounters in their daily rounds, and such events can become quite lively. Males indulge in short circular display flights above and between the tree canopies, their tails fanned, white-spotted rump feathers fluffed, and wingbeats making audible ‘fripping’ sounds to the accompaniment of rolling, whistled ‘prrreeeyo’ calls. Rivals of both sexes may also indulge in breast-to-breast fluttering. The whole scene is one of frenetic noise and activity, and such events have been appropriately dubbed ‘batis parliaments’.</p><p>Immature birds are allowed to remain within the parental territory until the onset of the next breeding season. The female solicits food from the male throughout the breeding season, crouching, and fluttering her wings like a juvenile bird and uttering a ‘kish-kish-kish’ call. Both birds build the nest, which is often very well concealed: a small cup covered with lichen and placed on a lichen-covered branch. Two eggs form the usual clutch. The male brings most of the food for his mate while she is incubating and for the chicks while she is brooding. One pair monitored in the Eastern Cape built their nest unusually low on an Acacia karroo branch only one metre above ground level; the tree was well encrusted with lichen, yet the birds collected all their nesting material from another, taller Acacia tree 50 metres away.</p><p>The Chinspot Batis is usually single-brooded, although replacement clutches are sometimes laid if the first nest is robbed. Apart from the usual risk of predation of eggs or chicks by a host of predators, this batis also has to endure occasional brood parasitism by Klaas’s Cuckoo. The batis has evidently not been an easy host species because the cuckoo has had to match its egg colour and size. This cuckoo has several other hosts, so its level of parasitism of the Chinspot Batis is modest.   &#9;</p>",

The Chirinda Apalis is common in the forests there and Peter Madziwana usually had a nest or two for us to photograph. However, some of the nests were too high, others did not have chicks. One year when we had a suitable nest we erected a hide but the chicks were predated before we managed to get any photographs. However, on our fifth attempt we were shown a nest about seven metres above the ground where we could construct a hide.</p><p>The nest was a typical apalis nest, an oval with an entrance to the side. We were told that the nest which we wanted to photograph probably had large chicks almost ready to leave the nest, which would mean we had little time for photography. In fact, the chicks were still very small. We had to construct an eight-metre scaffold hide to be level with the nest and it was remarkable that these birds continued feeding the chicks despite our movements as we built up a section of the scaffolding each morning and afternoon. Once we had completed the scaffolding and enclosed the top in hessian we moved the hide to about three metres from the nest. We were able to spend the next three days watching and photographing this pair of birds as they came and went, feeding the chicks at intervals of a minute or two for half an hour by which point the chicks were satiated. The adults then took a break for thirty or forty minutes before starting to feed again. The chicks fledged successfully a few days after we finished photography.&#9;</p>",

Firstly, he is remembered for his First World War services to the British Royal Navy, which he served for a further 32 years; and secondly, his name is irrevocably synonymous with cisticolas. Seven decades after his death, many still consider him to have been the most knowledgeable authority on this exceedingly challenging genus of birds. Lynes’s meticulous research culminated in the 1930 publication of a landmark monograph dedicated to the cisticolas, in which he first described a previously overlooked, south-central African endemic named the Chirping Cisticola.</p><p>The restricted global range of the Chirping Cisticola extends marginally into southern Africa, where it is a locally common resident in the Okavango Delta and the surrounding Kwando, Linyanti, Chobe and upper Zambezi river systems. Because its favourite haunts are predominantly tall, virtually impenetrable, permanently flooded papyrus stands and reed beds over deeper water, a makoro trip is often the best strategy to connect with this species. During the summer breeding season, males are easily located by their distinctive songs: a few hesitant introductory clicks followed by a buzzy, insect-like trill. Males also perform entertaining display flights low over the vegetation, zigzagging from side to side and moving their fanned tails about while singing loudly. &#9;</p><p>The restricted global range of the Chirping Cisticola extends marginally into southern Africa, where it is a locally common resident in the Okavango Delta and the surrounding Kwando, Linyanti, Chobe and upper Zambezi river systems.

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is South Africa’s only endemic robin-chat, with a range extending from the forests and dense bush of the Garden Route in the southern Cape to the Soutpansberg range in Limpopo Province. It is closely related to the Red-capped Robin-Chat and some hybridisation between these two species occurs in areas where their respective breeding ranges overlap, such as the Eastern Cape coastal region. In KwaZulu-Natal, a portion of the population undertakes a dry-season altitudinal migration from mist-belt escarpment forests to lower levels, and in winter Chorister Robin-Chats can be found alongside Red-capped Robin-Chats in remnant coastal forest patches.</p><p>Although the Chorister Robin-Chat is the larger of these two robin-chats, the size difference is not a very helpful means of separating them, and one really needs to see the bird’s head to be quite sure which of the two species was the owner of the dark-centred, rufous-coloured tail glimpsed disappearing into a thicket.</p><p>Although the Chorister Robin-Chat is the larger of these two robin-chats, the size difference is not a very helpful means of separating them, and one really needs to see the bird’s head to be quite sure which of the two species was the owner of the dark-centred, rufous-coloured tail glimpsed disappearing into a thicket.</p><p>Like the Red-capped Robin-Chat, the Chorister Robin-Chat is a superb mimic of other birds’ calls (as well as of yapping dogs, people whistling and train horns), and its song comprises a medley of imitations mixed with its own fluty notes.</p><p>During the breeding season, it normally sings from the forest canopy and has a loud and bubbly delivery, in contrast to the slurred notes of the Red-capped Robin-Chat’s song which commonly comes from the forest undergrowth. The call notes differ, but I have on several occasions heard and seen a Chorister Robin-Chat mimicking the ‘see-saw’ contact call of the Red-capped Robin-Chat. One breeding pair also adopted the antiphonal calls of the Southern Boubou as personal contact calls.</p><p>Although this robin-chat sings mainly from the canopy, it forages extensively on the ground, feeding primarily on insects such as small beetles, ants, caterpillars and moths. It will stray from forest into nearby gardens with adequate shrub cover, and occasionally ventures to the middle of open lawns to seize emerging earthworms trying to escape swarms of driver ants Dorylus helvolus, which are effective ‘beaters’, driving hidden invertebrates from cover. Like other robin-chats, Chorister Robin-Chats regularly associate with such ant columns, as well as with soil-heaving, subterranean mole-rats Cryptomys hottentotus. They also follow the diminutive Blue Duiker Cephalophus monticola and ride on the much larger Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus as these antelopes pick their way through the forest undergrowth, disturbing hidden insects with their passage. Although normally a shy species, this robin-chat may habituate to people when its territory abuts on a regular tourist site, hiking trail, or garden. One such bird, in a remote forested gully in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, was photographed perched on the boot of a seated hiker. Garden-visiting individuals can become very tame when consistently offered mealworms or cheese.</p><p>The favoured nest site is a ‘rot’ hole in a tree such as Lemon Wood Xymalos monospora. Thirty-two nests were built an average of4.9 metres above the ground, with the highest being at 12.5 metres, meaning that this robin-chat nests at higher levels than any other African robin. The nest material varies with locality and can be very sparse, a mere lining of the hollow with leaf midribs, or a cosy-looking cup in a bed of moss and lichen. It is built solely by the female, with the male in close attendance. The eggs match those of the Red-capped Robin-Chat, ranging from immaculate olive-green to glossy, dark chocolate brown, but are larger and often more rounded. Incubation and nestling periods are each about two weeks. The mottled, cryptically coloured fledglings initially hide in thickets of undergrowth and are fed and attended by their parents for up to six weeks. &#9;</p>",

The species is frequently found in rocky habitats, such as the dolerite formations around the Gariep Dam, where we found that it was one of the bird species that had either colonised the islands in the dam or had remained on the islands when the dam filled. The latter implies that Cinnamon-breasted Bunting territories are not large, and indeed the birds can nest fairly close to one another if suitable nesting habitat is scarce, such as the limited options provided by an abandoned borrow pit or quarry.</p><p>Although the Cinnamon-breasted Bunting superficially resembles the Cape Bunting, it has a pale bill, dark brown wings and cinnamon underparts, black-and-white speckling on the throat, and a white (male) or off-white (female) median crown stripe.</p><p>Although the Cinnamon-breasted Bunting superficially resembles the Cape Bunting, it has a pale bill, dark brown wings and cinnamon underparts, black-and-white speckling on the throat, and a white (male) or off-white (female) median crown stripe.</p><p>The Cinnamon-breasted Bunting favours a range of habitats, from rocky ridges, mountain sides, granite and dolerite outcrops with scattered bushes or trees, to almost bare rocky and stony patches in woodlands, stony slopes and erosion gullies and dry watercourses, but always with some rocks present. In Limpopo Province it occurs in broad-leaved woodland, but not in adjacent fine-leaved (Acacia) woodland. Cinnamon-breasted Buntings do overlap at times with Cape Buntings in rocky habitats, and occasionally in shrubland habitat, but in general the former prefers the rockier habitats.</p><p>Movements in this species are complex. Although resident in places, it is a breeding migrant in others, but there seems to be no clear pattern to this. The birds have a partial winter migration northwards from eastern parts of their range. In Zimbabwe and north-eastern South Africa numbers increase in December, but also can increase in places outside of the breeding season. Some individuals move considerable distances as shown by one bird ringed in July near Kimberley, Northern Cape, which was recovered almost a year later in Mwenezi district, Zimbabwe, a distance of 1&#160;037 km. In the Marondera district of Zimbabwe it was a comparatively rare bird most of the time, but in September in some years large, even very large numbers, would suddenly appear and breed in localised areas. The nests were in both Miombo Woodlands and more open drainage lines, often fairly close together, but always in rock-strewn areas.</p><p>Cinnamon-breasted Buntings are usually seen in pairs or family groups, occasionally singly or in small flocks. They forage on the ground, on bare or sparsely vegetated patches and among rocks, and on burned areas within a day or so of the fire. Seeds are usually taken from the soil surface, but also plucked directly from low-growing grasses such as Natal Redtop Melinis repens, the birds reaching up from the ground to do so. They also hawk termite alates from perches.</p><p>The nest is a shallow, neatly lined cup of grasses, fine twigs and rootlets, built in about a week, on a foundation of coarser twigs. The female collects the nest material, accompanied by the male, and builds the nest. The nest is placed against a rock or clod of earth on a rocky slope, in a crevice in a small rock face, in a depression in open stony ground, or among scattered rocks in a hollow. The eggs, usually three, are incubated by both sexes, but mostly by the female, and both sexes feed the nestlings on seeds and insects.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In the air the pratincole looks like a tern or an over-sized swallow by its flight, shape and aerial feeding habit. The wings are long and pointed and the tail forked while the flight is fast and agile. Despite having relatively short legs they can also run quickly. Great care needs to be taken in separating this species and its close congener, the Palaearctic Black-winged Pratincole, in the field as the main feature distinguishing the two species is the colour of the wing lining, it being chestnut-red in this species and black in the Palaearctic bird. The other important feature to watch out for is that this pratincole has a narrow white trailing edge to the wing. However, during the summer months the migrant is normally in non-breeding plumage, whereas all but the immatures of the Collared are in breeding plumage. These immatures often form non-breeding flocks while the adults are breeding, so it is essential to determine the identification characteristics if you want to separate these species.</p><p>The species reaches its southern limits in KwaZulu-Natal and the northern parts of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. North of our area it extends to Angola, the Congo, through East Africa to Ethiopia and Sudan. Another population lives in West Africa and there are highly fragmented populations occurring across Eurasia from Spain to Kazakhstan and Pakistan. The European birds are migratory, reaching West and East Africa but remaining about 5° north of the Equator. African birds are highly nomadic and migratory, the degrees of which have never been satisfactorily determined. As this pratincole is to a great extent an opportunistic breeder, making use of rainfall patterns and changing water levels, it is not known as to how far they may wander each year to find suitable breeding grounds. In Africa several different races have been described but the extreme nomadism would militate against these and it is likely that only a clinal colour variation exists. In the south the only truly migratory birds are those on the southern edge of their range in Zimbabwe and KwaZulu-Natal which move north as the summer rains become established.</p><p>The species reaches its southern limits in KwaZulu-Natal and the northern parts of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.

There are likely to be well in excess of 100&#160;000 birds and possibly as many as 300 000 in the eastern population of which we are part. There have been large declines in the populations of Europe due to habitat loss, disturbance and the use of pesticides but in Africa the extreme mobility of the birds is probably beneficial. In the Middle Zambezi numbers also declined with the vegetating of the sandbanks during long drought spells when no flood waters passed Kariba Dam to scour and rejuvenate sandbanks.</p><p>Pratincoles are gregarious breeders and may concentrate in very large numbers as they did at Lake Ngami in November 1989 when some 10&#160;000 birds were estimated. Normally they form much smaller groups of less than a hundred pairs, and at a Zimbabwean highveld site no ringed birds from previous years were ever recorded indicating the nomadic nature of even breeding birds. For breeding they favour flat, firm, bare ground often with sand or gravel soils, pebble banks or even stony spoil, lacking in any tall vegetation or obstructions such as rocks. Here their preference is for previously flooded areas such as extensive, shallow shorelines of large dams, river floodplains and sandbanks surrounded by flowing water.</p>",

They commonly join mixed-species bird parties; in some regions (such as the Eastern Cape) their membership of such parties is almost invariable. They behave much like white-eyes, often hanging upside down to glean the undersides of leaves and twigs in their search for insect prey. They are easily called up by ‘spishing’ and can be viewed at very close range on such occasions.

It must be remembered, though, that all so-called nectarivorous birds are also insectivores – they have to be to obtain protein, which is not a significant constituent of nectar. So sunbirds are commonly seen hawking small airborne invertebrates (mainly ants, wasps, flies and baby spiders) and taking prey from spider webs, but Collared Sunbirds seem to spend at least as much time actively hunting prey in foliage as they do visiting flowers for nectar. Nevertheless, they are ardent nectar feeders, despite their comparatively short beaks and tongues which cannot reach to the nectar at the bottom of a flower with a long corolla or tube. Collared Sunbirds overcome this constraint in the same way as white-eyes do; they stab the side of the corolla with their beak and slit it down to the base to access the nectar. This rough treatment evidently does not diminish the individual flower’s capacity to replenish its nectar supply, because these little sunbirds return to the same flower again and again to get their sugar fix.</p><p>Nests may be built at any time of year when conditions are favourable, although spring and summer months are usual. The choice of site, gathering of material (spider web being an essential component) and construction, is done entirely by the female, usually ardently and vociferously encouraged by the male. In one monitored attempt the nest took seven days to complete, but the construction period may vary depending on how far the female has to fly to find suitable materials. The male does not assist in incubating the eggs, though he may sometimes bring food to the sitting female, and he does assist in the feeding of the nestlings and fledglings. Nests are occasionally parasitised by Klaas’s Cuckoos. Some ringed individuals have lived more than 10 years, an impressive age for such a small bird.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Common Buzzard is a very common migrant from Europe and Asia which arrives in southern Africa in about October, and the majority depart again towards the end of summer in March or April, although a few overwinter. It is generally widespread over southern Africa in suitable habitat, especially in the open country/cropland mosaic of the Western Cape, but has become less abundant in this area in recent years – probably reflecting a gradual decrease in the population of this species, like many other migrants from the plains of central Asia. It is interesting that while this species is commonly seen in the open areas of South Africa, in Zimbabwe it is usually found in the tall open miombo woodlands of the plateau.</p><p>Judging from the large numbers of this species seen sitting on conspicuous perches, especially telephone poles, in the southern Cape and Karoo, many tens of thousands of birds must visit southern Africa each year. Although the Common Buzzard is usually described as a medium-sized, dark brown raptor, it shows incredible variation in the brown colouration. The birds are light to blackish-brown on the back and show even greater variation in underpart plumage, from uniform dark brown to mostly white, although many are pale brown with variable whitish patches, often forming a conspicuous lighter bar across the chest. This variability makes them difficult to differentiate from the slightly smaller Forest Buzzard, resulting in birders having to rely more on habitat and behaviour to identify these two species.</p><p>Judging from the large numbers of this species seen sitting on conspicuous perches, especially telephone poles, in the southern Cape and Karoo, many tens of thousands of birds must visit southern Africa each year.

Quite early on ringers took to trapping birds along roadways using Balchatri traps – a cage covered in loops of fishing line containing a hapless mouse to attract the buzzard. Subsequent re-traps indicated that the birds surviving to adults could expect to survive for more than 8 to 10 years. This also proved that in many cases the same bird came back to the same area each year, showing as much fidelity to their ‘wintering’ areas as other birds do to their breeding sites. This behaviour, termed ‘ortstreue’, has since been shown to occur in many migrant birds.</p><p>Although normally seen singly on perches, when food is abundant, such as at a termite alate emergence, considerable numbers of birds may gather and join the general mêlée which is associated with these events. The birds usually feed on the ground, dropping off their perch to catch prey. They eat insects such as grasshoppers, although they also take other prey like small mammals, birds and reptiles. They seem to attack any small animal they can overpower if these should occur on the ground below their perch. They hover occasionally, typically by flying into a headwind, but are not nearly as skilled at this hunting technique as the Jackal Buzzard.</p><p>Recently some birds resembling Common Buzzards have been found breeding in the extreme south-western Cape. These birds vary considerably in size and plumage and are thought to be at least related to Common Buzzards. Several other Palaearctic migrants have established breeding populations in southern Africa (e.g. European Bee-eater, Booted Eagle, Black Stork), while others breed more erratically (e.g. House Martin, White Stork). It is possible that Forest Buzzards formed in this way, and the breeding by Common Buzzards in the region may lead to the loss of species identity for Forest Buzzards if extensive hybridisation occurs.</p>",

The bird sits quietly within the canopy of the trees and because of its grey plumage, it blends fairly well with the rather dull grey leaves of the trees&#160;in which it occurs.&#160;When it spots a caterpillar it flies across to catch the prey. It is this movement which catches one’s attention and enables one to spot the bird. However, it does also forage among the leaves for insects, and again it is the movement which draws one’s attention to the bird. Like many cuckoos, this species specialises in eating hairy caterpillars, but they do also eat other insects discovered while foraging in the canopy.</p><p>In flight they have an almost falcon-like appearance, with long tapering wings and a long tail.&#160;However, they have a much slimmer build than a falcon and seldom fly above the treetops. Their flight is swift and direct as they move from one tree to the next.</p><p>This species has been extensively studied in Europe and is probably the best-known parasitic bird anywhere. It parasitises various small insectivorous songbirds – over 100 species have been identified so far. The robin is probably the best-known host, but flycatchers, chats, wagtails and pipits, warblers and buntings, are all parasitised. When seen near a potential host’s nest, the cuckoos are mobbed by smaller birds. &#160;&#9;</p>",

It is a common bird in suburbia, and a good mimic. There are no chickens in our garden, so we were surprised one morning to hear a mother hen clucking to her brood of downy, cheeping chicks. Investigation revealed that the hen and brood sounds were coming from the telephone line, where the local Common Fiscal male was rehearsing some masterful mimicry of poultry sounds he’d doubtless heard in the Dominee’s garden a couple of hundred metres away. I’ve seen the same male hovering like a helicopter 20 cm above a straying bantam chick which it would doubtless have pounced on but for my approach.</p><p>Common Fiscals are perch-and-pounce hunters, utilising the highest available vantage points to scan open ground. Perches are thus important, and studies have shown that territory size is inversely proportional to perch abundance; in other words, the more perches there are, the smaller the area that the shrike defends. Like many predators, they tend to attack prey that is incapacitated or inexperienced in evading attack, as are many young animals and fledgling birds.</p><p>Common Fiscals are perch-and-pounce hunters, utilising the highest available vantage points to scan open ground.

Like many predators, they tend to attack prey that is incapacitated or inexperienced in evading attack, as are many young animals and fledgling birds.</p><p>These shrikes also have the interesting habit of impaling prey, be it a locust, shrew, field mouse, snake or frog, on a wire spike or woody thorn. Various explanations have been advanced to explain this behaviour, but the one for which there is most observational support is that impaling or wedging large food items makes it easier for the shrike (or its fledglings) to dismember them. Barbed-wire fences are often utilised for such caches or larders, but food may also be stashed in less visible sites. A Western Cape observer saw a Common Fiscal fly into his Bougainvillea bush with a large pink object which turned out to be a piece of ham! This was impaled on a thorn, and small portions were then bitten off and flown 10 metres to the shrike’s nest as food for its young. Similarly, the carcass of a young Little Swift I found impaled in the middle of a very thorny Acacia karroo tree was regularly visited and fed on by two of the local Common Fiscal’s full-grown young. Although the variety and size of animals that these shrikes impale and kill may seem remarkable, vertebrates usually comprise less than 10% of their prey spectrum, the most common food items being arthropods, especially insects such as beetles and grasshoppers. Some observations suggest that Common Fiscals stock their larders in the early part of the day, returning in the hotter hours to feast at their leisure.</p><p>Whatever opinions one may hold about the Common Fiscal, there is no denying that its lifestyle is a success story, for it is one of the most widespread birds in southern Africa. Its butchering habits may seem cruel to some, but it is, after all, only doing what comes naturally to it. I don’t like the fact that it kills the Common Slug-eaters Dasypeltis scabra – they are small, innocuous and very useful garden-dwelling snakes because they eat slugs and snails. But the Fiscal has its uses too. If it sees a snake too big for it to tackle, such as a 1.5 metre cobra, it lets everyone know by breaking into its loud, churring alarm call.</p><p>And what can be a better accompaniment to a fine morning, two hours after sun-up, than a Common Fiscal churring away on his favoured song post, mixing harsh ‘tjert-tjert’ rasps with his whistled repertoire of personal phrases and copies of other birds’ calls?</p>",

The few ring recoveries to date have shown that the birds visiting southern Africa come mainly from European Russia east to at least 50°E.</p><p>A long-term ringing and colour-marking scheme that ran concurrently in the Harare area of Zimbabwe and the Port Alfred area of the Eastern Cape gave some valuable insights into the life history of this bird. The first returning migrants arrive as early as the latter part of July in South Africa, indicating an early post-breeding departure and a very rapid migration. Only one of these birds was resighted or recovered en route: a single bird resighted in France. The majority of the adults arrive during August and September, while the young of the year arrive later, mainly in October and November. Early arriving birds in August were sometimes found to be fairly emaciated, suggesting that they may have made only a single stop-over to refuel on their southward journey. Later arriving birds, in better condition, had probably made a more leisurely journey through the continent. Ortstreue, or the return to the same wintering site, is strongly developed in this species. Many birds returned year after year to the estuary at Port Alfred, but few birds were ever seen again in Zimbabwe, where the great majority were passage migrants, merely stopping over to refuel on their way south. Interestingly, one Zimbabwean-ringed bird was later found at Port Alfred!</p><p>Departure of adults from the south coast occurs over a very short time span in late March and early April. Before leaving, these birds have accumulated sufficient fat reserves, between 80% and 100% of normal fat-free weight, to carry them the length of Africa. Ring recoveries on northward migration all come from the eastern Mediterranean – Libya, Cyprus and Egypt – lending credence to this.</p><p>These birds are very active foragers. In coastal areas, most foraging takes place during the day, but this is extended into the night when the birds are fattening prior to migration. They usually forage alone, but aggregate into small flocks when feeding on shoals of fish fry in shallow creeks. They rarely probe for food, catching most food on the surface or in shallow water, but they do catch small crabs hiding in weed. During the Port Alfred study, individually marked birds often followed the same feeding route on a receding tide day after day.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Common Moorhen is widely distributed throughout the tropical and temperate regions of the world, and this cosmopolitan distribution is an indication of its adaptability. It is abundant and widespread in southern Africa in wetland habitats, and is only absent from forested and arid areas such as the Kalahari. The latter notwithstanding, isolated individuals and pairs thrive at small permanent water holes in Botswana’s central Kalahari, testimony to its mobility, flexibility and tenacity. The Common Moorhen was one of the first species to colonise Lake Ngami when it filled in 2004 for the first time in decades. It is assumed that they disperse at night, locating water bodies by reflected moon and star light, but this remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>This is a species with a broad habitat tolerance; nevertheless, it has a definite preference for permanent water bodies (as opposed to the Lesser Moorhen which favours ephemeral pans). Like other rallids, it flourishes in years of above-average rainfall, and more than 6&#160;000 pairs have been recorded on the Nyl River floodplain when conditions were optimal.</p><p>This is a species with a broad habitat tolerance; nevertheless, it has a definite preference for permanent water bodies (as opposed to the Lesser Moorhen which favours ephemeral pans). Like other rallids, it flourishes in years of above-average rainfall, and more than 6&#160;000 pairs have been recorded on the Nyl River floodplain when conditions were optimal.</p><p>Its diet is catholic, as one would expect in a generalist species – it is omnivorous, although plant material features prominently. In southern Africa, it has also been recorded eating aquatic invertebrates, tadpoles and frogs and even carrion – two were photographed at Kamfer’s Dam feeding on a dead flamingo.</p><p>Breeding behaviour has been well-studied in the nominate race in England, and an interesting feature is the rampant egg-dumping in the nests of conspecifics; however, there is scope for local observations to verify the generality of these details in our region. The red beaks and head shields of this species are badges of rank, and rivals judge one another’s fitness on the basis of the size and brilliance of these symbols (apparently the adults even favour chicks with bright heads, and this may be an indication of high carotenoid levels). The adults only resort to fighting if ritualised posturing fails; fights are vigorous with individuals raking each other with their long claws, and can result in injury to one or both antagonists.</p><p>A feature of courtship in this species is that the females compete for males, so agonistic encounters occur between females as well as between males. The heaviest females win most skirmishes, and select small males with large fat reserves. This is purely pragmatic, since a fat male can undertake a larger portion of the incubation, enabling the female to conserve energy.</p><p>In southern Africa, this species breeds throughout the year, with a general peak during the rains. Breeding is opportunistic, occurring whenever conditions are suitable as is evidenced by hundreds of nests at Lake Ngami in midwinter, soon after the annual floodwaters reach the area. As long as suitable conditions prevail, Common Moorhens continue to breed – they are multi-brooded, and productivity can be spectacularly high. For example, two pairs at Stellenbosch, South Africa, laid 37 and 40 clutches of eggs over four years, and fledged over 30 broods each, averaging four young per brood – a phenomenal 120 chicks per pair! With such prolific breeding potential, dispersal of immatures must be high, although the limited recoveries of birds ringed in southern Africa show mostly short distances travelled. Most small pans and dams have just one pair of breeding birds, and if one dies, its place is soon taken by another; floating birds must be moving around all the time searching for breeding opportunities.</p><p>The Common Moorhen has a very successful lifestyle. It thrives despite the vagaries of the natural environment and has benefited from some of humankind’s habitat modifications, such as the formation of numerous farm dams. This is the type of bird that will survive into the 22nd century.</p>",

According to one account, some of these birds were released from the top of a tram in Point Road, Durban. Another version holds that the birds arrived as pets of indentured people from India who came to the country to work in the sugar cane plantations. Whatever the case, this starling has been a characteristic and vociferous inhabitant of Durban ever since. Another release of these birds was made in Johannesburg in 1938.</p><p>The Myna has not expanded as fast or as far as the Common Starling, introduced to Cape Town by Cecil Rhodes in 1897, but it has managed to extend its range significantly within the summer rainfall region.</p><p>The Myna has not expanded as fast or as far as the Common Starling, introduced to Cape Town by Cecil Rhodes in 1897, but it has managed to extend its range significantly within the summer rainfall region.</p><p>Mynas are adept at catching grasshoppers and crickets (as indicated by their generic name Acridotheres, meaning ‘grasshopper eater’) and they have been officially credited with aiding in the control of army worm outbreaks, which can destroy lawns and pastures almost while you watch. Mynas regularly resort to pastures to associate with grazing animals. Like Cattle Egrets, they exploit the grazers’ potential to flush grasshoppers and other insects from concealment, and they often upgrade the association by feeding on the animals’ ectoparasites. Cattle and horses are the usual recipients of this valet service, but indigenous animals also benefit. In the Stainbank Nature Reserve near Durban, a ranger noticed a female Bushbuck with a drooping and very swollen ear. Closer inspection revealed the ‘swelling’ to be a myna which was weighing down the antelope’s ear while plucking ticks from it.</p><p>Mynas have a walking gait (it could be termed a swagger) and a very characteristic song call that goes ‘krrup krrup chirri chirri chirri weeyoo weeyoo’, a familiar sound in any city or town these birds have colonised. They have a variety of other calls as well, and are particularly noisy at their communal roosts, which can host hundreds of birds. Such a roost may be in a pavement tree next to a busy road in a city centre. The Mynas seem to show little concern about pedestrians or cars, and the prolonged cacophony that attends the settling-down time at a roost adds a new dimension to urban noise levels.</p><p>Like most members of the starling family, Mynas prefer to nest in holes, and because they live mainly in built-up areas, they look for suitable nesting sites in houses or other buildings, and use roof apertures, chimneys, gutter down-pipes and such like. They can be extremely secretive when building, so the nest is often a fait accompli and the house occupant only learns of it when the begging cries of hungry chicks draw attention to the presence of avian tenants.</p><p>Common Mynas are widely regarded as undesirable aliens and are unprotected by law, but they are nevertheless successful species and well established. Their detractors claim that they displace indigenous bird species, but there is no hard evidence to support this standpoint. An unbiased eye will observe that the Common Myna is a relatively handsome bird and that it does often play a useful role.</p>",

Ostriches are an ancient group, with functionally similar ancestors known from the early Miocene (about 20 million years ago). Fossils of the closest ancestor to the modern ostrich have been dated to the early Pleistocene, about two million years ago.</p><p>Most of the Common Ostriches in southern Africa are hybrids between the ‘feather’ ostriches of East Africa, the ‘West African’ ostrich, and the ‘southern’ ostrich. Some genetically intact, relic populations of the southern subspecies remain in certain areas – the ostriches at Kleinzee are reputed to be uncontaminated by ‘feather’ ostrich genes, and the ostriches of the Namib Desert, with their relatively long legs and small bodies, are thought to be genetically identical to the ostriches that roamed the plains of southern Africa a few centuries ago. The historical range of Common Ostriches in southern Africa is not clear because of translocation of domestic birds. Place names and relic populations suggest that the birds probably occurred throughout the semi-arid regions of Namibia, the Succulent and Nama Karoo, Botswana and south-western Zimbabwe. Today, truly ‘wild’ ostriches occupy only a fraction of their historical range in southern Africa.</p><p>Most of the Common Ostriches in southern Africa are hybrids between the ‘feather’ ostriches of East Africa, the ‘West African’ ostrich, and the ‘southern’ ostrich.

Today, truly ‘wild’ ostriches occupy only a fraction of their historical range in southern Africa.</p><p>Ostriches favour semi-arid and arid grasslands and shrublands, sparsely vegetated desert plains and open savanna woodlands, being most abundant on short-grass plains and in arid savannas. In the wild, ostriches are usually in pairs, small groups of 5-6 birds, or even larger groups of 30-40 birds, but they sometimes aggregate in very large numbers at water. In desert environments, much of their day is spent foraging, walking about with head held low (hence the myth of hiding their head in the sand so they cannot be seen), searching for small plants and grasses, especially small succulents, covering up to about 18 km per day. Stomachs of ostriches in the Namib Desert contained a kilogram or more of a single species of small succulent (Trianthema sp.): the plants had been pulled up and swallowed roots and all. In the interests of finding out the food value of this plant, four researchers spent over an hour in a favoured ostrich foraging area collecting these plants. In that time, we managed to gather less than 100 g between us, a tenth of what a single ostrich has in its gut.A pervasive myth about ostriches is that they eat anything. Not so. Their diet is almost entirely plant material, but does include small pieces of bone, teeth and shell fragments, probably eaten for the calcium content.</p><p>The species’ breeding system is complex. Males are territorial and polygamous, mating with up to four females, one of whom is a ‘major’ female, and the others are ‘minors’. The major female is the first to lay in the nest (a shallow basin dug in a sandy patch), and subsequently incubates and guards the eggs. Minor females lay in the same nest – their eggs are on the edge of the nest and mostly not incubated. The eggs are large, very hard shelled and much sought-after by jackals and hyaenas. The empty shells, used in the past for storage vessels, were an important part of the economy of hunter-gatherer peoples in southern Africa. Newly hatched young resemble hedgehogs, with spiky, black–tipped buff down on their backs and less spiky down below.&#9;</p>",

It lacks bold facial or throat markings, and the only difference between the sexes is the narrow, black anchor-shaped throat patch of the male compared with the white throat of the female.</p><p>Their distribution and movements are complex and variable.

Scattered individuals over South Africa and Namibia during winter, suggests that some birds are resident, but prone to local, nomadic movements.</p><p>Favoured habitats are shortish open grasslands, agricultural crops (particularly cereals), fallow weedy fields and pastures (particularly lucerne, clover, Eragrostis, kikuyu and rye grass). Grasslands that are seldom burnt or grazed, or that are burnt too frequently or overgrazed, are unlikely to attract Common Quails. By contrast, grasslands that are burnt every two years and moderately grazed provide the best cover for escape and nesting, balanced with openness for unhindered foraging. Other landscape issues affecting them are expanding commercial plantations, overgrazing, and rural human settlement. They avoid the drier western parts of southern Africa, and areas with dense bush and tree cover.</p><p>Their presence is often announced by the distinctive, ventriloquial ‘whit, wit-wit’ call, given repeatedly from within cover, sometimes even at night. This call is slower and less evenly spaced than that of Harlequin Quail. The flush call is a trill ‘crwee-crwee-crwee’, given as the bird darts away on stiff, whirring wings. If not flushed, they are difficult to see, running swiftly away through the grass in a hunched position when approached.</p><p>Their diet is varied, including the seeds of grasses, grains and weeds, flower buds, green leaves, and some small fruits, rhizomes and tubers. During summer, they consume caterpillars, grasshoppers and other small invertebrates.</p><p>Breeding is during winter (May to July) in Zimbabwe, midsummer (October to January) in KwaZulu-Natal; and in early summer (September and October) in the Western Cape. The nest is a scrape in the ground, lined with grass and rootlets, and is well concealed in dense herbaceous or grassy cover, sometimes among crops. The clutch of five to eight eggs, rarely as many as 14, is incubated by the female. Chicks hatch synchronously, can flutter-fly after 11 days, and can fly after 21 days.</p><p>Common Quails have probably benefited from crop farming in some areas of southern Africa, and are highly prized by wingshooters. Unfortunately, because they concentrate to breed during summer in South Africa, hunting coincides with their breeding season. If wingshooters are to continue to enjoy the hunting of this delightful gamebird, they need to delay the hunting season to allow successful completion of breeding. Elsewhere in Africa, migrating Common Quails are also heavily exploited for food by netting.</p>",

The species has an extensive breeding range from north-east Canada through Greenland and northern Eurasia across the tundra to the coasts of the Bering Sea in Chukotka.

The total number visiting the region’s coastline may exceed 11&#160;000, with a further 1&#160;000 inland. This is only a fraction of the total world population which is probably fairly stable at around 450&#160;000 birds. Local decreases may also reflect habi&#173;tat degradation, but in the Eastern Cape ‘blind’ estuaries (those that are periodically closed to the sea) are flooded in some years, making them unsuitable for small plovers. Along the south coast there are also many ephemeral pan systems that hold water only erratically, but when they do, are occupied by these birds. Following good winter rains these flood, and, as the water recedes, large areas of wet mud become available and can attract considerable numbers of Common Ringed Plovers. These birds do not flock in the same way as sandpipers, but are usually spread widely over the sand- and mudflats, coming together only at roost sites where they may join other small plovers.</p><p>The first birds reach the south coast by late September, with the major movement into the region happening during October and early November. Departure is also protracted, with birds leaving from late March until early May. It is very likely that these south coast birds are stopping over in Mozambique on both southward and northward migrations. The evidence for this is firstly that their arrival is later than that of most Palaearctic wader migrants, and secondly, that birds depart carrying fairly small fat reserves – insufficient to carry them much further than Mozambique. Very few overwinter.</p><p>At seasonal, inland waters, birds may remain as long as shorelines are receding but soon move on when flooding sets in. During one ringing study in Zimbabwe it was found that a proportion of ‘through’ migrants were true to their staging beach over many years. At the Kowie estuary, in Port Alfred, a small percentage of birds returned to the same site each year but overall numbers fluctuated annually presumably dependent on the amount of habitat available elsewhere along the coast. At Port Alfred, birds commute between the estuary and a nearby body of freshwater, returning to the estuary on the ebbing tide. Apart from favouring estuaries containing soft mud, many birds also forage on wave-cut platforms where relatively soft sandstone has been levelled by wave action.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This sandpiper has huge breeding and non-breeding ranges. The breeding range extends from Ireland and Spain in the west through to the Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan in the east, with the bulk of the population found between 55°N and 70°N. It winters throughout sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia and Australia, with a few birds remaining in western Europe during the boreal winter. Within southern Africa it occurs widely, but is most common in the moist eastern half of the region, especially from northern Botswana and Zimbabwe south to the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal. It is seemingly absent from much of the dry interior of southern Mozambique.</p><p>Essentially a freshwater species, Common Sandpipers are sparse on the open coast but more frequent in both tidal and non-tidal estuaries. The construction of dams and sewage works has not only increased the amount of habitat available to this species, but has probably also altered its distribution by increasing penetration of the arid west.</p><p>Essentially a freshwater species, Common Sandpipers are sparse on the open coast but more frequent in both tidal and non-tidal estuaries. The construction of dams and sewage works has not only increased the amount of habitat available to this species, but has probably also altered its distribution by increasing penetration of the arid west.</p><p>Because it is inconspicuous and scattered in small numbers across a multitude of small wetlands, it is difficult to obtain an accurate population estimate for the region. The total number visiting Africa is estimated to lie somewhere between 2.5 and 3.0+ million birds. The southern African estimate is more vague, lying somewhere between 10&#160;000 and 100&#160;000. There is a suggestion that numbers visiting the southern coastal plain have been decreasing for some time.</p><p>The more southerly breeding birds are the earliest Palaearctic-breeding migrants to arrive in southern Africa. They first appear in Zimbabwe in mid-July, and some have reached the south coast of South Africa by late July. In Zimbabwe, the vast majority of those recorded between July and September are passage birds en route to South Africa. This passage continues into October, but some of the October arrivals remain in Zimbabwe for the summer, as do the later arrivals which trickle in all the way through to December. In Zimbabwe, Common Sandpipers are most abundant on southward migration – because there is adequate suitable habitat available. Southern birds overfly that country on northward migration. The first departures from the south coast happen in late January and early February, and most have left by the end of March. Unlike on the southward migration, these birds do not stop over in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, departure only takes place from late March, with a few lingering into early May. Very few birds overwinter. Ringed birds show strong site fidelity both to migratory stopover areas and to their non-breeding quarters.</p><p>Birds ringed in KwaZulu-Natal and Zimbabwe have been recovered on northward migration in the Sudan. This, together with information on body-weight increases prior to northward migration, suggests that they have a potential non-stop flight range of between 4&#160;000 and 4&#160;500 km. To date, all ring recoveries from the Palearctic breeding grounds have been within a rectangle in Russia between latitudes 52-62°N and longitudes 33-55°E.</p><p>These birds usually occur solitarily or in small, loose groups, but come together to form communal, nocturnal roosts which may contain 70 or more birds. Preferred roost sites are on stones or gravel, and the sandpipers often join roosts of Three-banded Plovers in this habitat, especially at sewage works where they utilise the tops of unused filtration tanks. Unlike most other sandpipers, they never seem to roost standing in water: when on their own, they may roost in an ungulate footprint close to the water’s edge.</p><p>This species is readily identified by the white of the belly coming up in an arc in front of the shoulder. In flight, the short, sharp bursts of shallow wingbeats are diagnostic.</p>",

From a distance, or in dull light, they appear black with some white in the wings and tail, only really noticeable when in flight, although the female has a brownish wash to the head. They have a long, strongly decurved black bill which is much slimmer than those of the wood-hoopoes; the male’s being somewhat longer than the female’s.</p><p>Unlike the other wood-hoopoes the Common Scimitarbill is found in pairs except after breeding, when family groups of four or five may be encountered. The birds are found right across the northern two thirds of southern Africa wherever there are suitable woodlands. They are very common in the well-developed miombo and mopane woodlands of central Africa, but also occur in more arid savanna.</p><p>Unlike the other wood-hoopoes the Common Scimitarbill is found in pairs except after breeding, when family groups of four or five may be encountered. The birds are found right across the northern two thirds of southern Africa wherever there are suitable woodlands. They are very common in the well-developed miombo and mopane woodlands of central Africa, but also occur in more arid savanna.</p><p>The birds forage by clambering up the trunks of trees and out along branches, even hanging upside down on the bottom of a branch to seek insects, which are found by probing with the decurved bill into cracks in the bark. They normally start low down on a tree and work their way upwards into the top of the tree before flying on to the bottom of the next tree. The female has a shorter bill than the male, which is believed to reduce foraging competition between them. It is noticeable that the male tends to forage on the trunk and larger branches, while the female is inclined to forage on the smaller branches of the tree, perhaps better to enable her shorter bill to obtain food from smaller cracks. They eat mostly insects, with soft grubs being particularly favoured. Observation of food being brought to nestlings revealed that white grubs, spiders and grasshoppers were the main prey.</p><p>Scimitarbills were regular members of the mixed bird parties foraging in the woodland in the Marondera area of Zimbabwe and would stay with the party throughout the day. In the arid woodlands along the Kuruman River in the Northern Cape they often forage with groups of Pied Babblers.</p><p>They nest in a hole in a tree, often a natural hole, but also in the abandoned holes of woodpeckers and barbets. Clearly the bill is incapable of excavating a hole and they must rely on whatever is available.  We had considerable success with this species being attracted to nest boxes placed in trees in the woodlands around Marondera.</p><p>They lay two or three greenish-blue eggs, which is unusual for a hole-nesting bird (which usually lays white eggs). The eggs take 13-14 days to hatch and thereafter the adults need to run a shuttle service with food for the rapidly-growing chicks, and usually leave the nest after about three weeks. After fledging, they join the adults in foraging in the trees. The young remain with the adults for five or six weeks but thereafter join the mixed bird parties in the woodland. If there is plenty of food available in their patch of woodland, the adult female then sometimes lays a second clutch.</p><p>Like the wood-hoopoes, the oil from the preen gland is foul-smelling, which probably serves as a defence against mammalian predators that might raid their nests and roost holes at night. When handling this species for ringing, the oil gets on one’s hands and it takes considerable soap and water to remove the smell of the oil!</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Often disparagingly referred to as a legacy of Cecil Rhodes, the Common Starling was one of the British bird species introduced to the Cape at his behest, probably in 1897. Initially it was restricted to the Cape Peninsula, and it took until the 1950s to move out into the Western Cape. Then it underwent a relatively rapid expansion, reaching the Eastern Cape by the 1960s. The latest atlas data indicate that the Common Starling is still expanding its range, and now overlaps with the introduced Indian Myna in eastern South Africa. However, in the dry interior of the country it is restricted by its preferred feeding method, which involves probing in soft ground for insects and other invertebrates, using specially adapted jaw muscles to open its sharply-pointed bill once it is inserted into the soil. The Wattled Starling is the only other African starling with this morphological adaptation for ‘open-bill probing’ (termed ‘zirkeln’ in German).</p><p>Common Starlings are distinctive in flight, with short, pointed wings. Young birds are initially a dull grey and then moult patchily into the dark adult plumage. New feathers for adults and juveniles are pale-tipped, creating a spotted effect, but as these tips wear off the plumage becomes uniformly dark in appearance.</p><p>Common Starlings are distinctive in flight, with short, pointed wings. Young birds are initially a dull grey and then moult patchily into the dark adult plumage. New feathers for adults and juveniles are pale-tipped, creating a spotted effect, but as these tips wear off the plumage becomes uniformly dark in appearance.</p><p>In the countryside, Common Starlings favour open habitats, especially fallow lands and feedlots for livestock and Ostriches. They frequently join Pied and Wattled Starling flocks while feeding, and often form large flocks after breeding. They also roost with other starling species and weavers; reed beds are favoured sites, or palms and trees with dense foliage. There is no evidence of migration or other regular movements in South Africa.</p><p>In spring males sing for extended periods, producing a wide variety of warbles and whistled calls. They are good mimics; the ‘Good-Lord-deliver-us’ phrase of the Fiery-necked Nightjar is a particular favourite, and also the trilling song of the Southern Double-collared Sunbird. Singing posts are high perches such as the corners of buildings or lamp posts, and while singing the males spread and wave their wings.</p><p>When breeding, male Common Starlings have long hackles on the throat and bright yellow bills; females have a pinkish tinge to the base of the bill. Polygyny, where a male defends several adjacent nest sites, is recorded regularly in Europe and elsewhere, but there seem to be no records for South Africa. Here both sexes incubate (unlike all African starlings except Wattled Starlings), and both feed the young. In South Africa most nest sites are on or in man-made structures, including nest boxes. On Dassen Island, where nesting opportunities are limited, nests have been recorded in low bushes and even on the ground. Common Starlings in the ceiling are undesirable, as once the young leave the nest, the blood-sucking mites which have been feeding on the birds move out in search of new hosts.</p><p>The nest is a bulky assemblage of material, with green leaves added to the nest cup – these certainly play a role in courtship, and the selection of aromatic leaves could serve to reduce the numbers of lice and mites on the chicks.</p><p>Even though it is one of the few birds ranked in the world’s top 100 invasive species, the Common Starling in South Africa is largely dependent on man-modified habitats. In the southern Cape it commonly breeds in old Pied Starling nest holes, particularly those with short tunnels. However, there appears to be little aggression between the species. There is no possibility of eradicating the Common Starling, and we should accept it as an interesting species in its own right, with intriguing differences from the African starlings.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>If asked which birds are the most accomplished flyers, birders would be split into two camps: some would nominate hummingbirds, citing their remarkably precise hovering capabilities, ability to fly backwards and the sheer rate at which their wings are flapped; others would opt for swifts, given their dizzying aerial acrobatics and almost entirely airborne existence. In fact, these two groups are closely related – together with the tree swifts and owlet-nightjars, they belong to the order Apodiformes, the largest avian order after the passerines. Several structural characteristics of this order facilitate their extraordinary talents: very long primaries, short humerus bones, and very weak feet, the latter reflected in swifts’ scientific name, literally translated to ‘without feet’.</p><p>The Common or European Swift embodies an aerial existence to the extreme. It feeds, drinks, preens, plays, mates and even sleeps on the wing. Young swifts are able to fly virtually perfectly the moment they leave their nests and may not land again for the next two or three years. The average lifespan of the Common Swift is believed to be around seven years, but one record-breaking Swiss individual attained an age of 21 years; during its lifetime this bird flew an estimated 4.8 million kilometres – six times to the Moon and back.</p><p>The Common or European Swift embodies an aerial existence to the extreme.

The average lifespan of the Common Swift is believed to be around seven years, but one record-breaking Swiss individual attained an age of 21 years; during its lifetime this bird flew an estimated 4.8 million kilometres – six times to the Moon and back.</p><p>Swifts fly at different speeds during different conditions or activities: when gliding, they progress at a leisurely 20-50 km/h; during feeding bouts they travel at 40-100 km/h; and during social interactions and displays they can reach speeds of 145-220 km/h, ranking them as some of the world’s fastest birds.</p><p>Their shrill screaming is seldom heard in Africa but is a characteristic sound of sunsets in European towns and cities. They are amongst the last breeding migrants to arrive in the Palaearctic and the first to leave, being present only from May to July in central Europe. Almost their entire world population winters in Africa south of the Equator; in southern Africa they are present from late October to March.</p><p>Insects and spiders caught on the wing make up the bulk of the diet; pairs consume around 50 g of prey per day, specialising in prey 2-5 mm, but usually not more than 12 mm in length. The birds have excellent eyesight and are able to identify prey in split seconds, distinguishing between drones and stinging bees, for example. On the breeding grounds they are also known to arrive at their nests after nightfall and are reported to forage at night too. Swifts ‘sleep’ on the wing at 1.5 km above the ground, possibly entering unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, wherein one half of the brain is asleep (and one eye is closed) while the other half remains alert.</p><p>Common Swifts typically forage below 100 m above the ground, above which insects become scarcer; however, they have been recorded at an incredible 3&#160;600 m. During cold, overcast or stormy conditions they forage lower down, mainly because fewer insects are uplifted into the upper troposphere under such conditions, but also to avoid violent storms – a major cause of mortality. Indeed, during prolonged spells of bad weather, young swifts on the breeding grounds have been known to enter a temporary state of torpor, a major reduction in metabolism. Common Swifts are quick to exploit temporary abundances of food such as termite alate emergences or insects displaced by fires; in fact, they can sometimes be seen ‘smoke-bathing’, a behaviour that may assist in managing ectoparasites.</p><p>This species is highly nomadic on its southern African non-breeding grounds, depending on rainfall and insect abundance, as well as the movements of major storms and cold fronts. Occasionally they appear in unprecedented numbers virtually overnight, only to abruptly disappear again. At such times it is possible to look up and see a stormy sky filled with many thousands of these scimitar-winged predators.&#9;</p><p>&#160;</p>",

The overall numbers vary from year to year but probably peak at somewhere between 300&#160;000 and 500&#160;000, with the largest numbers on the central Namibian coastline. This is an interesting bird because our visitors reach us down both the west and east coasts of Africa. The west coast migrants are mainly birds from the Baltic but with quite a few Norwegian and north Russian birds, together with a very small proportion of British/Irish- and Dutch-bred birds, most of which winter further north in Africa. In Europe a migratory divide has evolved, and those birds breeding inland in eastern Germany, Poland and Lithuania south to the eastern Mediterranean and east into southern Russia and Belarus, migrate down the eastern side of Africa.</p><p>The western migrants leave their breeding grounds in late July, and the first birds reach as far south as the Eastern Cape by the second week of August. At this time few birds are found further north along the west coast, and it is evident that they bypass this area to reach their south coast destinations first. This differs from the east coast migrants which only start to arrive in late September or October, with major influxes occurring as late as January in some years. Presumably greater food resources are available at this time of year further north in East Africa and Mozambique, and there is less need to reach their southern destinations so early.</p><p>The western migrants leave their breeding grounds in late July, and the first birds reach as far south as the Eastern Cape by the second week of August.

Presumably greater food resources are available at this time of year further north in East Africa and Mozambique, and there is less need to reach their southern destinations so early.</p><p>Departure from the south takes place between February and April, again dependent on food availability in any one area: all migrants have left the region by early May. Many young birds winter in our waters, with the greatest numbers on the west coast, primarily in Namibia where the largest concentration of some 70&#160;000 birds was found at Sandwich Harbour in July 2010. Roosts of several thousand non-breeders may also be found in the Western Cape in some winters. These large overwintering numbers are a relatively recent phenomenon.</p><p>The large number of Common Terns visiting Namibia is probably a response to the local depletion of fish stocks that has given rise to a population explosion of krill and shrimp to which the terns have turned as their main food source. This very important food resource has probably led to a higher survival rate amongst the young in particular. When this resource declines suddenly, for example during warm-water events or sulphur eruptions – both of which give rise to high mortality amongst these crustaceans – then the birds move south, and probably north as well, en masse. It is also thought that a proportion head far out to sea to escape the local food depletion, but this is difficult to detect. The huge build-up of Common Terns in Namibia in recent decades has also led to fewer birds on average reaching the Eastern Cape, but mass movements away from Namibia sometimes result in large numbers eventually reaching the Eastern Cape as late as February.</p><p>Feeding takes place both inshore and offshore, but mostly out of sight of land. This requires a daily round trip, together with feeding movements, of at least 120-150 km because the birds prefer to roost on land rather than at sea. Those birds feeding at night presumably spend the night at sea, returning in the early morning to secure coastal havens. An undisturbed site is necessary for the birds to digest their food to build up reserves for the long northward trek, and to rest and preen.</p>",

It is the most widespread waxbill in southern Africa, and is also well distributed northwards as far as the Sahara Desert.</p><p>Common Waxbills are restless little birds, rapidly and regularly flitting their tails and wings. These movements draw attention to them, even when they are resting between foraging forays in (for example) the cover of dry winter vegetation lining a drainage gully, where their bright crimson beaks stand out like tiny jewels among the frosted stalks. The name ‘waxbill’ was coined for these birds and their kin because of the likeness of the shiny colour of their beaks to the sealing wax commonly used in the past on documents and envelopes.</p><p>Common Waxbills are restless little birds, rapidly and regularly flitting their tails and wings.

The name ‘waxbill’ was coined for these birds and their kin because of the likeness of the shiny colour of their beaks to the sealing wax commonly used in the past on documents and envelopes.</p><p>The preferred habitat of the Common Waxbill is the rank vegetation that grows on the fringe of wetlands, and the birds frequently gather to roost in reed beds. Hundreds of birds may use a favoured roost on any night, but daytime flocks can number as few as five individuals, though groups of 24–30 birds are more usual. Flocks are generally made up of several pairs of birds, although at the end of the breeding season they may also contain young birds, identifiable by their black beaks.</p><p>The disbanding of flocks signals the beginning of the breeding season, when Common Waxbills consort in pairs. In the summer rainfall region the breeding season starts any time from October to December, peaking in midsummer. In the winter rainfall region these waxbills start to nest as early as September, and there is little or no breeding after December. During the breeding period, male and female are inseparable, feeding together, perching together at rest, and often preening one other. Every task in the reproductive cycle – nest-building, incubation and feeding the young – is shared.</p><p>The ball-shaped nest, with its down-slanted spout, looks like a chemical retort flask, but it has an additional special feature. A smaller, oval chamber, occasionally feather-lined and sometimes also boasting a spout, is built on top of the nest. This is commonly termed the ‘cock’s nest’, notwithstanding that the cock sleeps with the hen in the main nest and doesn’t use the spare room. The building of this upper chamber is evidently instinctive, and is likely to be a decoy to outwit the numerous nest predators.</p><p>When compared with some similar-sized African insectivorous or nectarivorous birds, small seedeaters such as Common Waxbills do not enjoy a very long lifespan. The oldest Common Waxbill on record was ringed near Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal and recaptured alive there eight years and five months later. However, most adults of this species probably live for only two years on average, so their population turnover is quite high. They compensate for this by starting to breed as early as six months of age and by raising broods twice as large as those of many insectivorous birds and three times as large as those of sunbirds.</p><p>Finding sufficient food to feed up to six hungry chicks requires a lot of effort on the part of parent waxbills. When nesting in proximity to built-up areas they often resort to the nearest garden feeding tray to load their crops with high-grade bird seed, sometimes flying several kilometres each way in the process.</p><p>Despite the challenges that these little birds face in their short lives, they are a remarkably successful species. Because they do well in captivity, the bird trade has exported them, and the inevitable escapees have established wild populations in Portugal, Spain, South America, and on some Atlantic and Indian Ocean islands.</p>",

The rump is barred brownish, giving it a rusty appearance.</p><p>These birds are both heard and seen along the rivers of the Okavango and Zambezi Region, where they occur in association with riverside vegetation. On the Zambezi River above Victoria Falls this bird is found wherever there are thick patches of giant papyrus or reeds. Like other coucals, as the sun rises, it often clambers up to the highest point of papyrus and sits there with wings slightly spread, absorbing heat from the sun. This is particularly noticeable after a cold winter’s night. If one approaches the bird too closely, it rapidly disappears down into the papyrus, and its passage can be followed by the shaking papyrus heads as the heavy bird moves through the stems. They usually call from a conspicuous perch both morning and evening; this is to proclaim the year-round territory of the resident pair, and will continue calling as one passes in a boat or canoe.</p><p>These birds are both heard and seen along the rivers of the Okavango and Zambezi Region, where they occur in association with riverside vegetation.

However, this species has a much deeper and slower call than the other coucals which occur in the same area. When calling, the birds reach forward and bend their head down to the breast as they puff up their throat and neck feathers.</p><p>On the upper Zambezi this species is not averse to moving away from cover to forage on open ground between clumps of papyrus or reeds. The ground is almost bare apart from short, well-cropped grass, and a large bird of this size is very conspicuous as it walks around searching for insects and small vertebrates, such as grass frogs.</p><p>The nest is a loose ball of grass placed in a grass thicket and built by the male only. The nests are mostly within one metre of the ground and, because of their large size – being more than 300&#160;mm in diameter – are fairly conspicuous. Eggs are sometimes laid before the nest is complete and because incubation – probably by the male only – starts from the first egg laid, broods may contain chicks of varying size. This is probably to ensure that at least one chick survives if food is in short supply. The chicks are black, with long, white downy filaments on their heads and backs, but those on their wings are shorter. Like chicks of other coucals, they are very ugly!  The young are fed by both parents, and beg with loud calls as an adult approaches the nest. They leave the nest well before they are able to fly, giving loud calls when away from the nest, to enable the adults to find them.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the smallest southern African francolin and the only one with distinctly different male and female plumages. The male has a plain, mustard-yellow head with a dark chestnut crown. The female resembles a small Shelley’s Francolin, but lacks the chestnut stripes on the breast and flanks, and has a broad white eyebrow stripe that extends onto the neck. Both sexes have an orange tail which is conspicuous in flight.</p><p>They are one of the most widespread of Africa’s francolins. In southern Africa, they have a distribution similar to the Crested Francolin, from north-eastern Namibia, across northern and eastern Botswana, and scattered across Zimbabwe, Mozambique, northern South Africa, Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal. They inhabit tall grasslands, savannas or well-grassed woodland, especially Miombo and Mopane; in drier country they occur on sand dunes with substantial bush cover. In the highveld grasslands, they are typically found in open veld scattered with protea and cabbage trees. These are truly birds of natural habitats, rarely venturing far into cultivated farmlands. They often co-occur with Shelley’s and Crested Francolins, and Swainson’s and Natal Spurfowl, the latter two species usually occupying denser, woody cover.</p><p>They are one of the most widespread of Africa’s francolins.

They often co-occur with Shelley’s and Crested Francolins, and Swainson’s and Natal Spurfowl, the latter two species usually occupying denser, woody cover.</p><p>Mostly found in pairs or small family groups of up to 12 birds, coveys are localised, probably territorial, and can be found at the same site throughout the year. They are difficult to see, being particularly reluctant to flush. Rather, they choose to run low, almost rodent-like, through cover to avoid detection. In bushy habitat, when they do flush, they typically do so from the far side of a bush, flying quite far, dodging between trees, and seldom flush a second time. When approached by a vehicle, they crouch, relying rather naïvely on their cryptic plumage for camouflage. Many individuals become roadkills as a result of this unsuccessful behaviour.</p><p>The characteristic call is a piercing, repetitive, two-syllable ‘co-qui’ or ‘swem-pie’, given often when a covey is flushed and is regrouping, hence the English and Afrikaans common names. The territorial call, given by the male, is a loud, tinny, trumpet-like ‘ter, ‘nk, ink, terra, terra, terra, terra, terra’, with the second or third notes being loudest and the last notes fading away. Calling birds often perch on a vantage point such as a termite mound or boulder.</p><p>The diet is different from the other grassland francolins, consisting of fewer corms and bulbs, and more seeds and small fruits. Like the other francolins, however, they ‘scratch out’ ground food with the bill, but also differ somewhat from the other francolins in using a sideways motion of the bill. Their summer diet includes a variety of insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers, mantises and winged ants. They are known to drink dew and raindrops from grass blades, and are probably not dependent on standing water.</p><p>Peak breeding in Namibia and Botswana is during May, while in South Africa it is between December and April. In Zimbabwe, breeding occurs almost year-round, with a peak between February and August. The nest is a shallow scrape in thick cover lined with grass and leaves, and is particularly difficult to find. The clutch is usually 4 or 5 eggs, but as many as 8 have been recorded, which could indicate egg-dumping by a second female. Incubation by the hen starts only after the clutch is complete, but the incubation period is not yet known. The chicks can fly at 7-10 days, but stay with their parents for a lengthy fledging period, and apparently suffer high predation rates.</p><p>Potential threats to their conservation are cultivation for crops, motor vehicle road-kills, and changes in grass cover because of frequent veld fires and continuous grazing by livestock.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Shearwaters are a large group of petrels adapted for diving, including having strongly flattened tarsi and rather small wings that are used for propulsion underwater as well as in the air. As a result they tend to have higher wing loadings than most other petrels, and are less efficient dynamic soarers. Their common name stems from their tendency to fly low and fast over the water; literally ’shearing the water’. By trading off their flying ability for diving ability, they tend to be confined to regions of the world’s oceans that are productive in terms of food, and experience consistently high winds. The Calonectris shearwaters are exceptions to this pattern, as they have long, broad wings adapted for gliding in relatively unproductive, calm tropical waters. In terms of flight action, they are intermediate between Procellaria petrels and the Puffinus shearwaters. Their large wings compromise their diving ability, and Cory’s Shearwaters seldom dive to more than 5 metres. In fact, the maximum dive depth of most birds studied was less than 1 metre. They obtain much of their prey by surface-seizing or by shallow plunge-diving, splashing into the water from the air at a very shallow angle. They are agile in the air, often grabbing flying fish and Sauries in the air as they attempt to elude predatory fish or dolphins. Sometimes they fly in front of ships to pursue flying fish.</p><p>Cory’s Shearwater is a trans-Equatorial migrant, breeding at islands in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and wintering in the south Atlantic and south-west Indian Oceans. Tracking studies using tiny geolocator light loggers (see Wandering Albatross) show how the bulk of the population follows the trade winds, using the same route preferred by sailing ships. Leaving their colonies, they travel down the African coast to Senegal, head across the Atlantic to Brazil and travel close inshore along the east coast of South America to around 30ºS before heading across the south Atlantic, past Tristan da Cunha, to southern Africa. Returning north, they take a more direct route up the west coast of Africa, cutting across the Gulf of Guinea, thus completing a large figure of eight that allows them to travel downwind most of the way. However, some birds that winter off Namibia come south directly down the West African coast.</p><p>Cory’s Shearwater is a trans-Equatorial migrant, breeding at islands in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and wintering in the south Atlantic and south-west Indian Oceans.

Given that adults are present at their colonies from late February to October-November, it is evident that many birds in our waters are immatures and failed breeders. They are perhaps most abundant on the Agulhas Bank, but large numbers also occur along the shelf break and out into oceanic waters, especially along the Walvis Ridge and Agulhas Current. They exhibit little interest in ships or fishing vessels, other than to sometimes fly in front of them to chase pelagic fish. They are gregarious, and often roost on the water, frequently in large groups.</p><p>There are two well-marked subspecies, both of which occur in southern Africa. The nominate form, ‘Scopoli’s Shearwater’ that breeds throughout much of the Mediterranean, is smaller and paler than C. d. borealis from the Macaronesian Islands and western Mediterranean. Some authorities treat them as different species, but their genetic differences are minor and the two intergrade where they meet. Cory’s Shearwaters are caught accidentally on longlines, impacted by introduced predators at some colonies, and chicks are still harvested for food in a few areas. Despite these impacts, the global population of some 200 000 pairs is not considered to be threatened.</p>",

A denizen of both moist and dry open woodland throughout northern Botswana, Zimbabwe and northern and eastern South Africa (including, in recent decades, the Free State), it has readily colonised wooded gardens.

In fact, many townsfolk have a soft spot for this chunky bird with its amazing, multi-coloured plumage and monotonous metronomic, trilling call – not exactly musical, but soothing and reassuring nevertheless.</p><p>One of the secrets to this bird’s success lies in the fact that it is highly territorial – the Crested Barbet has consolidated its place in the environment by reducing competition from conspecifics for resources. Crested Barbets are monogamous, and pairs establish an area of their own for breeding and feeding, and then defend it against others of their kind. Prolonged bouts of calling by both sexes from prominent positions are, of course, territorial advertisement, and birds in neighbouring territories will sing in response. The greatest competition to any species comes from conspecifics, but next is that from the species’ closest relatives, so it is not surprising that Crested Barbets are also very aggressive towards Black-collared, Whyte’s and Acacia Pied Barbets. In Harare, for example, where Whyte’s Barbet has moved into gardens with Brachystegia and Julbernardia trees the generalist Crested Barbet will successfully displace it. Most of the inter-specific competition appears to be for suitable nest holes, so the Crested Barbet does also come into conflict with unrelated species, and it is not always the winner – it can be evicted from its nest by Lilac-breasted Rollers, and there is a record of its nestlings being ousted and killed by the alien Common Myna.</p><p>Other competition for the species comes from unexpected quarters. Both Greater and Lesser Honeyguides parasitise this species, and there is a constant battle against them – the barbets have a specific high-pitched ‘war-cry’ when detecting honeyguides near their nests. Despite this, it appears as though they are at the mercy of the honeyguides – keen birders who installed a closed circuit television camera in a nesting box were horrified to record two Lesser Honeyguides attacking the adult barbet and killing two out of the four chicks in the nest! It is thought that this behaviour was to force the barbet to synchronise its laying with that of the honeyguides, a Mafia-like twist to brood parasitism.</p><p>Despite these setbacks, Crested Barbets are prolific breeders. They are multi-brooded, making up to six breeding attempts during the protracted summer season. Unlike several other barbets, Crested Barbets are not co-operative breeders and so do not have helpers at the nest. Nevertheless, the number of young which fledge successfully each season is high.</p><p>Although the Crested Barbet is very much taken for granted, there is still much to be discovered about this species – why, for example, does it react so frantically towards Flap-necked Chameleons? What defences has the species evolved to counter brood parasitism? In situations where these birds live in gardens, there is a golden opportunity for all of us to add to the knowledge of this species by making and publishing accurate ecological observations.&#9;</p>",

The black tail feathers are characteristic when fanned in flight. Their closest relatives are the Grey Francolin Francolinus pondicerianus and Swamp Francolin Francolinus gularis of Asia. The most distinct subspecies, which is more streaked on the belly and flanks, ranges from northern Mozambique to Kenya and is classified by some as a separate species, Kirk’s Francolin.</p><p>Crested Francolins occur across the bushveld of north-central Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, north-western and southern Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and most of north-eastern South Africa. They favour thickets and woodlands, particularly thornveld with sparse ground cover, and also move into bush-encroached savannas. In the drier savannas, their range overlaps with Coqui and Shelley’s Francolins, and with Swainson’s and Natal Spurfowls. However, they generally keep within dense stands of scrub and thicket, habitat not favoured by the other francolins, but often shared with the two spurfowls.</p><p>Crested Francolins occur across the bushveld of north-central Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, north-western and southern Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and most of north-eastern South Africa.

However, they generally keep within dense stands of scrub and thicket, habitat not favoured by the other francolins, but often shared with the two spurfowls.</p><p>This francolin is mostly seen along roadsides and in openings in woodlands. Their coveys of two to five birds are probably a territorial pair and their young from the previous breeding season. During the heat of the day, they retire to dense undergrowth, where only the sound of their scratching in leaf litter discloses their presence. When disturbed, they prefer to run rather than to flush, scampering rodent-like into dense thickets. However, when flushed, they fly low and fast, weaving between the trees. Unlike other francolins, which are largely terrestrial, they regularly land in trees to avoid ground predators. They also roost at night huddled together on a horizontal branch within the crown of a tree. The call, given mostly in the early morning and less so at sunset, is a characteristic sound of the bushveld. So closely synchronised is the repeated ‘kee, kik, kerrik’ duet between the male and female that it sounds like the call of one individual.</p><p>During winter they feed on corms, bulbs, green shoots, leaves, berries and the seeds of parasitic mistletoes. Their summer diet is largely insects. An unusual component of their diet in some areas is acacia resin, obtained from the bark while perched in trees. Like Red-billed Spurfowl, they peck and scratch seeds, and seek out invertebrates found beneath the droppings of elephants, rhinos and buffaloes.</p><p>They are monogamous, and pairs can remain stable for most of the year. Males compete for mates, approaching each other with side-on display postures, body feathers held erect and their heads turned downwards. This often leads to vicious fights, with the feet and spurs being the primary weapons. Once a pair is established, the male will courtship-feed his mate, catching insects and dropping them in front of her while giving a soft whistle. The female solicits mating by drooping her wings and exposing her barred back to the male. Most breeding in South Africa is during October to March, coinciding with the summer rains. Breeding starts later in the north, peaking from March to May in Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. The nest is a fairly deep scrape in the ground under dense, low bush, and is lined with grass and leaves. The clutch of 4-9 eggs is incubated by the female for 20 to 22 days. The male guards the nest, warning the incubating hen of impending danger with a soft ‘koo woo koo woo kirr kirr kirr kirr’ call. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and are cared for by both parents. If a predator approaches, the parents attempt to distract it by limping away, feigning injury. The only potential threat that may cause populations to decline is the clearing of bush for domestic fuel, agriculture and grazing.  &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Crested Guineafowl can be distinguished from other guineafowls by lacking the horny casque on its head and having, instead, a crest of curly black feathers. It has crimson eyes and a pale grey ‘hood’ of skin on the back of its head. The body and wing feathers have a bluish tinge and pale, bluish white spots, with cream-coloured outer flight feathers, visible at rest and forming a conspicuous pale band in flight. More often heard than seen, they cock their tails like a bantam and scurry around in a seemingly confused manner when alarmed.</p><p>In southern Africa, they occur from the eastern Zambezi Region of Namibia, along the middle Zambezi River valley, and in southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, northern Limpopo Province and northern KwaZulu-Natal south in the coastal forests to just north of Durban, with an isolated population in the Karkloof Forest near Howick. They prefer forest edge, secondary and gallery forest, and spend much of their time secluded in thick bush. Although associated with forest and woodland habitats, they are found in both moist and semi-arid sites, but seldom spend much time in cultivated farmlands.</p><p>In southern Africa, they occur from the eastern Zambezi Region of Namibia, along the middle Zambezi River valley, and in southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, northern Limpopo Province and northern KwaZulu-Natal south in the coastal forests to just north of Durban, with an isolated population in the Karkloof Forest near Howick. They prefer forest edge, secondary and gallery forest, and spend much of their time secluded in thick bush. Although associated with forest and woodland habitats, they are found in both moist and semi-arid sites, but seldom spend much time in cultivated farmlands.</p><p>Crested Guineafowls are generally secretive and wary, although they can become fairly tame around tranquil bush camps. Like Helmeted Guineafowls, they are sedentary and roost in trees at night. They are gregarious during autumn and winter, but with flocks averaging fewer than twenty birds. These flocks break up into smaller groups and breeding pairs in summer. During the early morning, the flock moves into a forest glade to preen and socialise in the warmth of the morning sun. In the dim light before sunrise and after sunset, they venture onto bush tracks. They are a noisy species, sometimes calling well into the night and during the otherwise quiet predawn hours. The alarm call is a croaky staccato ‘chuk-chuk-chukchukerr’, which is often the first clue that the birds are around. Flock members keep in contact with one another by emitting low-pitched ‘chuk’ calls.</p><p>They feed on a wide range of fruits, berries, soft shoots, stems, green leaves, bulbs and roots, as well as a variety of invertebrates, including spiders, beetles, grasshoppers, termites and millipedes. They do not favour maize or other agricultural grains. They forage mainly on the ground, quietly scratching in leaf litter and debris with their feet, but also fly up into trees to pick fruit and berries. They often forage in association with Vervet Cercopithecusaethiops  and Samango C. mitis  Monkeys, feeding on scraps of fruit and seed-bearing faeces that fall to the forest floor. This relationship takes advantage of a two-way alarm system: the monkeys warning of intruders from the trees above and the guineafowls scouting for danger on the forest floor.</p><p>Crested Guineafowls are monogamous, and the male courtship-feeds his mate. Breeding usually starts with the first summer rains. The nest is a shallow scrape in the ground in thick cover, often situated near a log, perhaps to hide it from predators. Incubation, by the female only, lasts 23 days. The chicks (also called keets) can fly at 14 days, and moult into juvenile plumage when about one month old.</p><p>Although their populations appear to be stable, local range decreases might be brought about by the loss of forest and thicket habitats. They are not favoured by wingshooters, but are vulnerable to collisions with motor vehicles. They often flush ahead of a vehicle, find themselves hemmed in by impenetrable vegetation on either side of the track, then fall back and land in front of the vehicle.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Kalahari savanna which extends over the northern Cape, Botswana, Namibia and into Angola is the domain of the Crimson-breasted Shrike; indeed it is a Kalahari ‘special’ and shares this distinction with a handful of other passerines. Since over 90% of its range is in southern Africa, it is regarded as near-endemic to this region. It would be a good candidate for national bird in Botswana or Namibia – indeed the Germans in South West Africa referred to it as the ‘Kaiservogel’ or ‘Reichsvogel’ due to its colours, but changing political fortunes have precluded it from becoming the national bird in Namibia!</p><p>It is a breathtakingly beautiful bird, and the specific part of its scientific name – atrococcineus, which means black and scarlet – does not tell the whole story. Both sexes have jet-black wings and back, a pure white wing-bar and striking blood-red breast, and the sight of a pair duetting from the top of a small Acacia in the early morning light is not easily forgotten. The call itself is evocative of the Kalahari, and proclaims the pair’s territory – ‘quipquip-tzui-quipquip’– two notes initiated by the male interspersed with a single quick response from the female. This duetting is thought to keep the pair in contact with one another in the dense vegetation they inhabit. Despite its conspicuous colouration and noisy vocalisations, this is a skulking species, spending most of its time in thickets where it forages unobtrusively on the ground and on tree trunks for its invertebrate food. Ants are definitely its favourite item, but it will take a wide variety of other insects too.</p><p>It is a breathtakingly beautiful bird, and the specific part of its scientific name – atrococcineus, which means black and scarlet – does not tell the whole story.

Ants are definitely its favourite item, but it will take a wide variety of other insects too.</p><p>Southern African ornithologist Warwick Tarboton kept several pairs under observation around his home, and found that they roosted regularly at fixed sites in the lower reaches of thorny trees. Roosting and nesting sites were remarkably similar, and the bark-fibre nest, bound with spider web, was invariably located in a vertical fork or against the main stem of a thorn tree. Most interestingly, he found that breeding success in this species is extremely low, with parasitism by the Black Cuckoo being a significant problem. There is probably a considerable selection pressure on the shrikes to breed as early as possible in spring before the cuckoos arrive; this would, however, be counteracted by other environmental considerations such as food availability, with the shrikes performing a delicate balancing act.</p><p>Given that the radiant red breast is a strong visual signal used during territorial display, in much the same way as that of the European Robin, it is interesting to speculate on the origin and occurrence of the yellow-breasted morph. This form, illustrated in most field guides, really does exist, and has a rich cadmium-yellow breast! Numerous individuals have been seen and photographed over the years, even though only a small percentage of shrikes display this condition. Apparently this is not true polymorphism where different plumage colour phases, called morphs, exist in the population, but rather a genetic aberration which results in a pigment deficiency. This is correctly termed ‘schizochroism’. Whatever the cause, the yellow-breasted bird seems to behave ‘normally’, forming and maintaining pair bonds – and breeding – with the red-breasted variety.</p><p>Colour in the Crimson-breasted Shrike seems to be of secondary importance to sound as a territorial cue – birds in Botswana responded to playback of the very similar calls of the related Black-headed Gonolek from East Africa, leading researchers to hypothesise that they are conspecifics. DNA analysis may well reveal some interesting relationships between the gonoleks and our Crimson-breasted Shrike so don’t be surprised if you find the Crimson-breasted Gonolek in one of the new field guides!</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>All cisticolas look very much the same. Don’t try to work out which is which by looking at them and comparing what you see with what is illustrated in any book. There could be half a dozen species in the area and sometimes in Zimbabwe as many as ten. And don’t begin to work on them until there is a good deal of green grass about and they are calling. Begin by compiling a list of cisticolas which occur where you are birding and eliminate the rest. The next thing to consider is always the habitat. Cisticolas are primarily grass warblers rather than bush or reed warblers. The Croaking Cisticola, the largest species in the family, has a very extensive distribution, extending from West Africa across to Ethiopia and south to the coastal lowlands of the Eastern Cape.</p><p>It is a bird of open areas, but can tolerate about 40% bush encroachment, as long as grassy patches remain in between. The territory must also contain elevated posts from which the male can survey his territory. These are usually small trees or shrubs, but can be rocks, anthills or telephone lines. The male  performs aerial flights during which he calls loudly and flies around in up to  half a dozen circles about 200 metres across and performed only 20-25 metres above the grass tops, with short pauses between display flights. The ‘song’ is a series of loud double croaks, ‘k-roak, k-roak’, repeated at approximately twice per second and given in bouts of 25-35 croaks. He also gives this song from the top of a bush or other elevated perch.</p><p>It is a bird of open areas, but can tolerate about 40% bush encroachment, as long as grassy patches remain in between.

He does not have the bright colours of the bishops and widows, but is an active bird quick to respond to the intrusion of any human. Amongst his repertoire of shorter calls there are two calls which one quickly gets to recognise: the first is a slightly drawn-out and rising note lasting almost a full second. This is a ‘creeEEK’, pause, ‘creeEEK’, repeated several times. It is an early-warning call to his mate meaning ‘man about’. You move away and that call stops. You move closer and the ‘creeEEK’ gives way to the much shorter and very emphatic ‘CHIPmunk’, meaning ‘get off’ (your nest). This is red alert and if the female takes no notice he will leave his look-out perch and, still calling, fly a long descending line until he is right over her, when he will flick up in flight and may turn and repeat the manoeuvre, with the aim of chasing his mate off the nest or away from fledglings.</p><p>At this point you will see her take flight. Not a quick dash for alternative cover but a rather hesitant fluttering, only a couple of metres above the grass tops, during which she gives a soft ‘shwrrr’ call. She then quickly disappears into the grass not far off. Whereas in most cisticolas male and female give the same distress calls, distinguishable only by volume and intensity, male and female Croaking Cisticolas have quite different alarm calls.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Crowned Cormorant is confined to the Benguela upwelling region, breeding between Walvis Bay in central Namibia and the extreme western part of the Eastern Cape. It is the marine counterpart of the Reed Cormorant, and was treated as a race of this species until 1982, but differs in being slightly larger, with longer legs and a shorter, less graduated tail. Adults have smaller, less contrasting pale tips to the wing coverts and mantle feathers, and in breeding plumage have a longer crest. Immatures are darker below, especially on the breast, than immature Reed Cormorants. Crowned Cormorants are almost exclusively marine, but do at least roost at coastal wetlands occasionally, where they may occur side by side with Reed Cormorants.</p><p>Crowned Cormorants are shallow water specialists, typically feeding in water less than 5 metres deep, but have been recorded diving to almost 20 metres. They sometimes feed in the inter-tidal zone and in shallow pools, and can be seen chasing fish right at the water surface. Given their habitat preference, Crowned Cormorants typically occur close to shore, but occasionally wander out to sea. On one memorable occasion an immature bird was seen flying more than 20 kilometres offshore, where it looked decidedly lost. It may have been dispersing; birds ringed as chicks sometimes move long distances. One chick from Dassen Island in the Western Cape was recovered more than 500 kilometres away at the Orange River Mouth on the Namibian border, barely six weeks after fledging.</p><p>Crowned Cormorants are shallow water specialists, typically feeding in water less than 5 metres deep, but have been recorded diving to almost 20 metres.

One chick from Dassen Island in the Western Cape was recovered more than 500 kilometres away at the Orange River Mouth on the Namibian border, barely six weeks after fledging.</p><p>Crowned Cormorants feed singly, preying mainly on small, benthic fish, especially klipfish (Clinus spp.), blennies (Chalaroderma spp.) and pipefish (Syngnathus spp.). However, they also eat a variety of crustaceans, polychaete worms, small octopus and other molluscs. They usually feed over rocky bottoms, moving slowly along the seabed searching for their prey. When they feed over sandy bottoms they travel faster and cover more ground. Dive duration increases with water depth; it averages 20-30 seconds, but may occasionally last as long as one minute. Like most other cormorants, they forage in short, discrete bouts that typically last 20-30 minutes, then return to land to warm up and digest their catch.</p><p>Like all cormorants, they are monogamous and breeding occurs colonially, with typically 10-20 pairs breeding together. Colonies occur mainly on offshore islands, but they use a variety of locations, including coastal cliffs, piers, wrecked ships and disused ships anchored in harbours, as long as they are safe from terrestrial predators; they even nest on rock stacks among dense colonies of Cape Fur Seals. They build nests from vegetation and other material, these days often including pieces of rope and netting which can entangle chicks and adults. At some sites they reuse the same nests for many years, building impressive communal nest stacks that tower above the surrounding terrain. This behaviour, coupled with their preference for raised breeding locations, tends to reduce the risk of their chicks being taken by raiding parties of Great White Pelicans, but they are still taken at times, especially on Dassen Island.</p><p>The total breeding population is around 2 500 pairs, 60% in South Africa and 40% in Namibia. The population appears to be stable in Namibia and the Western Cape, but may have decreased in the Northern Cape. However, it has expanded its range eastward past Cape Agulhas in recent years and now breeds as far east as Tsitsikamma National Park in the Eastern Cape. It is regarded as Near-threatened due to its small population size and limited number of breeding sites.</p>",

They are large and majestic enough to make any birdwatcher ‘ooh’ and ‘ah’. However, because of their choice of forested habitat they are often overlooked. One may see the birds flying overhead, particularly during the early part of the breeding cycle in June or July. In flight their large body size and short, broad wings are particularly noticeable. This also shows the bright rufous underwing markings which are otherwise not visible.</p><p>Adult Crowned Eagles are relatively easy to identify because of their large size, but they do show some variation in the marking on the breast. The breast is rufous with heavy black barring. On the back the birds are almost black or very dark grey in colour. The tail is comparatively short, and the wings are broad and rounded. The legs are feathered down to the feet. The juveniles are much paler than the adults and have a boldly-barred tail.</p><p>Adult Crowned Eagles are relatively easy to identify because of their large size, but they do show some variation in the marking on the breast.

The legs are feathered down to the feet. The juveniles are much paler than the adults and have a boldly-barred tail.</p><p>The Crowned Eagle is considered to be a bird of the thick indigenous forests, but they often occur in more open woodland, provided there are large trees for nesting. They are quite common in the Save conservancy in the south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe where they nest in Baobab Trees. They have colonised large areas of miombo woodland along the watershed in Zimbabwe by making use of huge eucalypt trees in which they nest. Within 15 kilometres of Peterhouse School where I taught, there were no fewer than three pairs of Crowned Eagles nesting in large eucalypts. These birds were discovered by the Falconry Club boys at Peterhouse who discovered at least two of these nests, and probably the third one as well.</p><p>The birds hunt by sitting on a perch and watching for mammals passing below.  Although they have a reputation for eating large numbers of monkeys, in fact they will take any animal that they can overpower, and small antelope such as duiker and small bushbuck are killed by the bird when dropping down from a branch onto the back of the animal. In the Save conservancy we came across a Crowned Eagle with its talons firmly locked in the neck and back of a small female bushbuck.</p><p>Early in the breeding season the male in particular, but also the female, start flying above their territory, calling to advertise their presence. This is undoubtedly the easiest time to see this species. The male flies above the forest canopy calling with a loud, melodious ‘kewee-kewee-kewee’ which carries over a very large area. The female’s call is somewhat different and may be rendered ‘koi-kio-kio’. This calling continues during the period when the nest is being renovated – they usually use the same nest year after year unless something happens to the nest or their chick is predated from the nest. The nests can become huge piles of sticks which become so big and heavy that they are known to break the tree in which they are built.</p><p>Crowned Eagles lay one or two eggs usually in late July or early August so that the young are in the nest at the time of greatest food supply in October and November. Like many of our eagles, if the female lays two eggs and both hatch, the older chick always kills its younger sibling. During the early part of the nestling cycle the female seldom leaves the nest and is fed entirely by the male but once the eaglet is bigger, spends less and less time at the nest, instead helping the male to catch food to provision the chick.</p>",

Although largely confined to mesic woodland and forest, they are quite mobile, and occasionally are subject to irruptions outside their normal range, sometimes reaching the Western Cape.</p><p>This species is a very dark brown, almost black bird with white on the belly and at the tip of the tail. They have a dark red bill with a yellow stripe at the base of the bill. The male has a slight casque, which the female lacks. They are about the same size as the much more widely-spread and common Yellow-billed Hornbill.</p><p>This species is a very dark brown, almost black bird with white on the belly and at the tip of the tail.

They are about the same size as the much more widely-spread and common Yellow-billed Hornbill.</p><p>The birds are found mainly in forests or well-developed woodland. They occur extensively in riverine forest and also in coastal forests along the whole of the southern African eastern shoreline. Inland they are found in montane forests in some areas, but are not found in the more open country inland from the coast. It is noticeable that while this species is resident in the evergreen forest, it tends to move in and out of the deciduous woodlands nearby.</p><p>My introduction to the Crowned Hornbill was at a farm in the Great Fish River valley near Carlisle Bridge. The farmer had put up a nest box on a pole near the stone kraal where sheep were dealt with. The Crowned Hornbills had taken over the nest box and were feeding chicks through the slit entrance. In retrospect, the nest box was probably a Crowned Hornbill’s nest that the farmer had brought in from the riverine forest.</p><p>The birds have very loud high-pitched whistling calls. During the breeding season the calls are a series of notes which rise and fall as they call to one another. When not breeding, the birds are normally found in groups, and as the flock flies along they keep in contact with a single-note contact call, which draws attention to the approach of the group. Their flight is light and buoyant, and unusually undulating, even for a hornbill.</p><p>The Crowned Hornbill feeds mainly on fruit and small invertebrates which are found within the foliage of trees, although they descend to the ground to forage occasionally. They eat a great variety of fruit, particularly wild figs, including some crop species such as bananas and pecan nuts. They also eat a very wide range of animals, including lizards, chameleons, millipedes, beetles, caterpillars and termite alates. They have been recorded as wiping off the hairs from a caterpillar before eating it.</p><p>The birds are solitary nesters, with the typical hornbill habit of the birds mating and the female then sealing herself into the nest hole. This species also may seal up other cracks in the tree trunk in which the nest hole is found. It would appear that the pair of hornbills normally remain near their nest hole and will visit the nest hole throughout the year. As the breeding season approaches they come to the nest more and more often, until the female seals herself inside. Thereafter the male feeds the female until the oldest chick is about 25 days old, when the female emerges from the nest. The chicks then reseal the nest, leaving a small slit through which food is passed to them by both the male and female. The chicks leave the nest about 50 days after hatching at which point they closely resemble the adults. They remain with the adults for six to eight months until the next breeding season approaches.&#9;</p>",

Three races are currently recognised, with the most widespread form – nominate coronatus – occurring over most of our region. Southern Africa is also home to a paler, arid-country form, xerophilus, found mainly in Namibia and western Botswana. During extreme droughts, birds of this race penetrate north-east into Zimbabwe and have even been found in the middle reaches of the Zambezi River. When the two races are seen side by side they are quite easy to separate, but eastward incursions of the arid form have probably been greatly overlooked.</p><p>Although this species is widespread in our area there are notable gaps in its distribution. It is absent from much of south-western Namibia and the western Northern Cape, most of Mozambique and Lesotho, and from southern KwaZulu-Natal into the former Transkei. At these latter, moister sites it is mainly replaced by the Black-winged Lapwing. The global population is estimated at between 500&#160;000 and 1 million birds, with probably around 100&#160;000 in southern Africa.</p><p>Although this species is widespread in our area there are notable gaps in its distribution.

The most resident birds are those of the coastal areas, while the most migratory are found in the wetter areas such as Zimbabwe where their habitat becomes untenable as vegetation becomes too lush and tall during the wet season. However, in Zimbabwe, where grass levels are maintained by grazing through the summer, small numbers remain. In the Marondera area, residency increased during the 1980s and 1990s with more land being opened up for agriculture, increased cattle production and increased harvesting of thatching grass. For those birds that do move out in the summer, Botswana seems to be the main receiving area; numbers there can be very high from summer through to autumn; large numbers also gather at this time in the South African section of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.</p><p>During years of lower rainfall this lapwing may become very common in the coastal areas of the Eastern Cape, breeding at sites such as playing fields and golf courses, but during wetter years there seems to be considerable movement out of the area, presumably to inland sites where rainfall is more erratic.</p><p>Most birds breed from about two years old, but may breed earlier if conditions are particularly good. One pair of ringed birds bred in Port Elizabeth at about 16 and 18 months of age, but this is probably unusual. Although normally a solitary nester, small, loose breeding associations may occur with little aggression between neighbours. The benefits of such semi-colonial breeding may outweigh the benefits of solitary breeding because co-operative harassment of predators is probably more effective. However, co-operative harassment is probably more effective against aerial predators than those of terrestrial predators such as mongooses and feral cats: these played havoc with breeding Crowned Lapwings at a Port Elizabeth golf course.</p>",

Shelley, someone not as well known as his uncle, the poet Percy B. Shelley. George Shelley did visit Africa a couple of times and had an ‘honorary’ office at the British Museum.</p><p>Like many other grassland birds in Africa, Cuckoo Finches have seasonal changes of colour and are more brightly coloured in the summer breeding season. But that brighter summer look does not come as a result of moult but from wear and tear of the old feathers. In fresh plumage many of the feathers have darker tips that wear away, exposing the brighter yellow.</p><p>Like many other grassland birds in Africa, Cuckoo Finches have seasonal changes of colour and are more brightly coloured in the summer breeding season. But that brighter summer look does not come as a result of moult but from wear and tear of the old feathers. In fresh plumage many of the feathers have darker tips that wear away, exposing the brighter yellow.</p><p>Today the Cuckoo Finch is classed with the Viduidae, which includes the parasitic whydahs and indigobirds. However, it has in the past also spent time as a ‘parasitic weaver’. It was sent back to the finches principally on the strength of its skeletal structure, the way the feathers grow and modern DNA analysis. Even the modern experts acknowledge, however, that it does have strong affinities with the weavers. For example, the predominantly yellow plumage is shared with most weavers and very few finches. The male’s courtship display with wings extended as it gives a sizzling call while sliding up a grass stem before mounting his mate, is all pure weaver behaviour and quite unlike the complicated formalities that accompany most finch courtship. The sexual dimorphism in the whydahs and indigobirds is very marked and the ladies come to the gentlemen, some of whom form leks for the purpose of attracting females. Cuckoo finches have no call posts, male and female are quite similar, and they often travel in pairs.</p><p>But does DNA really tell us all there is to know about this enigmatic brood parasite? Consider the fact that every other member of the 20-strong Viduidae family lays white eggs and parasitises one or more members of the 130-strong Estrildidae (waxbills, firefinches and twinspots), every one of which also lays white eggs. But the Cuckoo Finch never lays white eggs and never parasitises any of the Estrildidae. Instead, like the weavers, Cuckoo Finches lay eggs with a variety of colours and markings. In the case of the Cuckoo Finch, these generally match the eggs of their cisticola and prinia hosts, even when the colours and markings of the hosts’ eggs also vary widely. Like some of the cuckoos, this finch is locked in an arms race with its hosts who do not always accept third-party eggs. So the Cuckoo Finches have to try and fool cisticolas by laying cisticola-like eggs and prinias by laying prinia-like eggs. The level of refinement they have reached in such mimicry is quite extraordinary. We have not got to the end of this controversy and the Cuckoo Finch’s days in the taxonomic company of the viduine finches may still be numbered.</p><p>Whatever their true family associations, these are not every-day birds. They are seldom plentiful; they are not exhibitionists and have no obvious behavioural traits that set them apart in the field. At first glance they look like just another ‘winter weaver’ or another look-alike, off-season-plumaged widow or bishop. They are essentially grassland birds, but favour areas with a scattering of bushes where they regularly sit quietly and inconspicuously. They sometimes flock but are usually encountered alone or in twos and they don’t have much to say except in flight, when they utter short, staccato phrases of twittering notes as they take off or fly past, fast and low. They roost communally at night in reed beds.</p>",

They favour tidal estuaries and embayments, salt marshes and saltworks, as well as wave-cut platforms and beaches with a dense wrack of stranded seaweed. Inland they prefer the shallow margins of larger wetlands, but may occur on virtually any freshwater body. They often occur in small flocks, frequently accompanied by other species such as Little Stints and Ruffs at freshwater wetlands, and Sanderlings and Ruddy Turnstones along the coast.</p><p>They tend to demonstrate sex-linked differences in diet and feeding ecology, with the shorter-billed males taking a higher proportion of tiny snails than females, which take more large prey items. As a result of these dietary differences, the two sexes often flock separately, and females tend to forage faster than males. Foraging is restricted by the tides at coastal sites, and they tend to join high-tide roosts with other waders.</p><p>They tend to demonstrate sex-linked differences in diet and feeding ecology, with the shorter-billed males taking a higher proportion of tiny snails than females, which take more large prey items.

Foraging is restricted by the tides at coastal sites, and they tend to join high-tide roosts with other waders.</p><p>Despite having a relatively restricted breeding range in the central Siberian Arctic, mainly between 80°E and 155°E, large numbers spread out to winter mainly in Africa and in lower densities across southern Asia and Australia. The ratio of non-breeding area to breeding area is greater for this species than for any other species of Calidris sandpiper. There is a tendency for western breeders to migrate to Africa and eastern breeders to migrate to more eastern localities, but ringing recoveries show no clear migratory divide on the breeding grounds. This may reflect the nomadic behaviour of this bird when breeding. Most migration to and from Africa is probably overland, with more birds moving down the east coast of Africa than the west coast. Because there are few staging areas along their route, some flights are probably several thousand kilometres.</p><p>The first adults arrive from the second half of August, sometimes in considerable numbers if breeding has been unsuccessful (see under Little Stint for effects of the lemming cycle on shorebird numbers) with a major influx in September. The young of the year arrive from late September through November. Departure from the south can begin as early as late February or early March, but the main northward movement occurs during April. Many juveniles remain for their first austral winter, but some make a partial migration, possibly reaching as far as East Africa.</p><p>The population visiting Africa is roughly estimated at 1.4 million birds with at least 120&#160;000 visiting southern Africa. At one time the natural pans of the Cape Flats area were of prime importance for birds arriving from their northern breeding grounds. As these pans dried up, the birds moved to Langebaan Lagoon for the rest of the season. With the massive urbanisation around Cape Town most of these wetlands have been lost, considerably reducing the numbers of Curlew Sandpipers in this area. However, habitat loss cannot account for the more than 90% decrease in their numbers along the Western Cape coast, irrespective of the levels of human disturbance. Part of the reason for the decrease at the southern limit of their range may be increased habitat availability farther north. Counts at Walvis Bay have increased, thanks to the expansion of extensive saltworks there. More birds also are thought to winter in West Africa than was formerly the case, linked to the development of large water-storage schemes. However, these birds tend to be more nomadic throughout the season because of the instability of water levels in the interior.</p>",

Otherwise, the birds are brown in colour with darker brown speckles and white tips to the wing coverts, forming a double wing-bar. They are widespread and common in many parts of northern South Africa, through Zimbabwe and into Botswana and Namibia.  They are relatively uncommon in Mozambique. They are even more widespread in Africa north of our area. They occur in both dry and wet woodlands, and in both the broad-leaved and the acacia woodlands throughout the areas above.</p><p>My experience of this species in the Marondera area on the Zimbabwean plateau is that the birds prefer the more open woodlands and are not found in woodlands with a continuous tree canopy. They also occur along the open stream lines within the woodlands. However, we saw this species most often in the farming areas where the woodland had been cleared and crops planted. The opening up of the woodlands always meant that there was more grass and, therefore, more grass seeds on which the Cut-throat Finches could feed.</p><p>My experience of this species in the Marondera area on the Zimbabwean plateau is that the birds prefer the more open woodlands and are not found in woodlands with a continuous tree canopy.

The opening up of the woodlands always meant that there was more grass and, therefore, more grass seeds on which the Cut-throat Finches could feed.</p><p>These finches are most often seen feeding on the ground in small to large groups.  In Botswana I have seen groups of well over fifty birds feeding together in an open sandy area created by man trying to cultivate the sand! Flocks split up into pairs when breeding begins. They feed on both seeds and insects, although it would appear that seeds are more important. There is some evidence that they eat Harvester Termites. They certainly attend termite alate emergences, but usually those of the smaller termite species. At such flights they will feed on the ground and will also attempt to catch the flying alates. Competing with the far more agile swallows and swifts by catching the alates in flight was quite a challenge!</p><p>Although they are perfectly capable of building a very typical waxbill-type nest in the form of a ball of dry grass with an entrance on the side, this species, in my experience, usually tries to use the deserted nests of weavers. In the Marondera area the birds made extensive use of the Southern Masked Weaver nests which were scattered all over the district, usually with two or three nests in a single tree. This weaver did not occur in colonies – each male had his own group of nests in a tree in the open which had ‘drooping’ branches onto which the nest could be attached. There were usually two to five nests in various stages of construction and provided there were spare branches, the unused nests were not ripped down. The finches would commandeer one of the weaver nests despite the fact that others might still be in use with weaver chicks.</p><p>A pair of finches nested in a weaver’s nest at my home on a farm in the Wedza district. The adults returned to the nest regularly with food for the chicks and I set up a hide nearby. However, I found trying to get good photographs at the nest very frustrating as the finches would land on random perches about three or four metres  from the nest and then fly rapidly up into the weaver’s nest. They would use such a variety of perches that I could not pre-focus on a particular perch. They never hung below the nest like the weavers did!</p><p>I never saw the adults bringing insects to the chicks, so I presume that they were feeding the chicks on seed regurgitated from the crop.</p>",

The Damara Hornbill is endemic to central and north-western Namibia, extending locally into southern Angola. It resembles the Southern Red-billed Hornbill with which it overlaps in the east of its range, but has white, not streaked, cheeks, sides of the neck and upper breast. It also has yellow, not brown eyes, and is slightly larger than the Southern Red-billed Hornbill.</p><p>The Damara Hornbill’s call is typical of the Tockus hornbills, consisting of a series of ‘kok’ notes. The call can be rendered ‘kok-kok-kok-kok-kok-kok.....kokok-kokok-kokok-kokok-kokok......’ with each part of the double note being of equal duration and intensity. Although the call is similar to that of the Southern Red-billed Hornbill, the latter has the first part of the double note longer and more intense than the second.</p><p>The Damara Hornbill’s call is typical of the Tockus hornbills, consisting of a series of ‘kok’ notes.

Although the call is similar to that of the Southern Red-billed Hornbill, the latter has the first part of the double note longer and more intense than the second.</p><p>This species favours acacia woodland, especially along the Namibian escarpment but is also found in Mopane and broad-leaved woodlands as well as well-treed savannas. In the more arid regions of Namibia it is confined to riverine woodland. It can be locally common, and pairs join up into small flocks during the non-breeding season. At this time they range widely in search of food in a relatively arid environment. In the evening they find a large thorny tree such as an acaciaor Buffalo Thorn Ziziphus mucronata in which to roost. Once the rains start the flocks break up into pairs to breed. The nests can be less than 200 metres apart in productive habitat.</p><p>They are usually seen foraging on the open ground, running or bounding along in typical Tockus hornbill fashion. They eat a large variety of invertebrates, including grasshoppers and armoured ground crickets, ants, termites, spiders, scorpions and solifuges. They occasionally eat reptiles and frogs. They grab prey from the surface or locate it by digging with their bill. They are also recorded as jumping up to pick insects off the leaves of bushes and trees above head height.</p><p>Breeding in this species has been extensively studied using specially modified nest boxes so that the female can be observed in the sealed nest. Courtship and copulation occur several weeks before the female enters the nest. Most nests are natural holes in larger trees, usually with a fairly narrow entrance. The female reduces the entrance to a narrow slit using crushed millipedes brought by the male, combined with her own faeces. The bottom of the nest has a mat of corkwood and bushwillow leaves. The first egg is usually laid 5-11 days after the female enters the nest. While three or four are the normal clutch, up to eight eggs have been recorded. The female starts incubation immediately the first egg is laid, so the chicks hatch in succession after approximately 25 days incubation. The female normally leaves the nest approximately 45 days after laying the first egg, when the oldest chick is 18-20 days old. The chicks immediately reseal the entrance. The female then joins the male in feeding the chicks. Subsequently the chicks break the entrance seal to fledge. They usually remain near the nest for a number of days before joining the adults in foraging for food. &#9;</p>",

In Namibia, the species is much more common, occurring at a number of sites along the coast and extending into southern Angola. It is in Namibia that the bulk of the world popu&#173;lation occurs, numbering possibly 2&#160;500 pairs.</p><p>In South Africa, this species is a solitary breeder, and with pairs spread over vast, remote areas of the coastline, it is very difficult to determine total numbers. The national population is thought to be around 120 pairs. However, this population is a cause for conservation concern, and the species is presently categorised as Near-threatened in South Africa. Habitat destruction, especially coastal development, is the main threat. The banning of off-road vehicles along beaches has certainly benefited this bird, but vehicles on the beaches and dunes remain a major problem in Namibia.</p><p>In South Africa, this species is a solitary breeder, and with pairs spread over vast, remote areas of the coastline, it is very difficult to determine total numbers.

Habitat destruction, especially coastal development, is the main threat. The banning of off-road vehicles along beaches has certainly benefited this bird, but vehicles on the beaches and dunes remain a major problem in Namibia.</p><p>Virtually the entire population migrates north to spend the austral winter along the Gulf of Guinea coast of West Africa; recent studies have shown, however, that a small proportion of the Algoa Bay population appears to be resident, but it is not known whether this involves the same individuals each year. In some years a few birds spend the winter in Namibia; these may be from South Africa.</p><p>Although a solitary nester, Damara Terns tend to concentrate on certain sections of coastline. A recent study in the Alexandria dune fields of Nelson Mandela Bay found that individuals may nest in adjacent dune slacks, but rarely would one slack be used by two pairs at the same time. The breeding adults vary considerably in their behaviour when breeding: some nests are relatively easy to find whereas other pairs leave the nest and start to give alarm calls long before the observer reaches the nesting slack, making nests very difficult to find. The single egg is laid on the bare sand, gravel or fragmented shell pieces, and is well camouflaged.</p><p>Once hatched, the single youngster remains at the nest site for a few days before starting to wander. In the ensuing weeks, some young may travel considerable distances over the dunes. For a small, dumpy chick they are remarkably agile. They can run over steep-sided dunes faster than one would expect and have left more than one researcher puffing in their wake. Once they have crouched on the substratum they are almost impossible to see until they move again, usually in response to food being brought by a parent. When they have fledged they move to the open beach where they may aggregate in loose flocks. At night they form communal roosts on extensive pebble beds or on patches of coarse sand or storm-washed debris.</p><p>At the Alexandria dune field breeding is spread out over several months and, if successful, then no further attempt is made by a pair. If the single egg is lost, the birds may re-lay – but not always at the same site (adding to the problems of estimating population size). It is also thought that many of the later breeders may be late-arriving migrants.</p><p>This species superficially resembles the similarly-sized Little Tern, but in breeding plumage has a black, not white, forehead, and an all-black, not a dusky, later, changing to yellow, bill. The Little Tern is mainly in non-breeding plumage in southern Africa, only moulting into breeding dress from mid-February. In non-breeding plumage, the upperparts of Damara Tern are uniformly grey, while the Little Tern usually shows a contrast between the grey back and upperwings, and the pale grey (often almost white) rump and tail.</p>",

The song phrases do include some grating elements, but they are always introduced by a sequence of clear, musical notes. Regional dialects are evident in the song, and are clearly important to the singers: when recordings of birds from KwaZulu-Natal were played to Eastern Cape birds, they paid no attention, but responded vigorously when their own individual songs were played back to them. Both sexes sing throughout the year, with the performance of a duet surely requiring some practice, and presumably playing a major part in the establishment and maintenance of their long-lasting pair bonds. Studies of captive birds with a human ‘tutor’ showed that young birds quickly learn to synchronise their whistles with those produced by their human partner, and it appears that the song is normally learnt within the first two years, and not modified thereafter.</p><p>Dark-backed Weavers are mainly insectivorous, sear&#173;ching through the leaves, branches and bark at various heights in the trees. They are usually found in pairs; family parties remain together for a short time after the nesting period. However, they often join mixed-species flocks of insectivores that are a feature of our forests and woodlands, often associating with white-eyes, sunbirds, warblers and puffbacks.

Courtship and song occur away from the nest, before, as well as during, the nest-building period. Even though they are solitary breeders, a pair often builds new nests in the same area as in previous years, so that two or three nests occur together. Nests have a long entrance tunnel and are suspended from the tip of a branch over a path or stream bed. The birds often strip the leaves from all the branches in the immediate vicinity of the nest. Despite their extended tunnel and inaccessible location, some nests are robbed by tree snakes. Nests are woven from leaf stems and the tendrils of creepers, so that they never appear fresh and green, and have a rough and unfinished-looking outer surface. The inside is lined with soft material such as lichens. The sexes are not distinguishable by any reliable plumage characters, but one bird, presumed to be the male, does most of the building, and may also sing hanging from the nest. Both members of the pair incubate, and feed the young; in captive birds, the fledglings were still fed occasionally up to six weeks after they had left the nest.</p>",

But aspects of its behaviour, its nest and eggs, and especially its song, are much more akin to reed warblers than to flycatchers. Indeed, it is now thought to be closely allied to some of the Eurasian Hippolais, and together with its close relative, the Mountain Yellow Warbler I. similis of East Africa, placed in a new genus Iduna. (Interestingly, the third species formerly grouped with the two yellow warblers, the Papyrus Yellow Warbler, is not closely related to these species, and is now placed in its own genus, Calamonastides.)</p><p>The Dark-capped Yellow Warbler is seldom encountered far from water. It can be found in woodlands adjacent to wetlands when grass and bush fires at the end of the dry season have destroyed streamside vegetation and reed-bed fringes. Although it does hawk small flying termites when they emerge after a shower of rain, most of its foraging takes place in thick, low vegetation (such as bracken-briar patches) in which it creeps and hops about. If one approaches a perched bird on its bush-top or tall reed-stem song post, it drops into cover rather than flying off to another perch.</p><p>The Dark-capped Yellow Warbler is seldom encountered far from water.

They habitually sing on sunny summer mornings along one such stream which flows below the rest camp at Giants Castle Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal. Their song is melodious and rather similar to that of the Lesser Swamp Warbler (formerly called the Cape Reed Warbler). Neighbouring males on prominent perches indulge in singing contests, raising their crown feathers and posturing for extra effect. However, they move to lower elevations during the cold, dry winter months. This altitudinal migration of birds is widespread in the Drakensberg, where the land rises in a series of escarpments from sea level to over 3 000 m over a distance of 100 km. Monitoring of birds at Darvill Sewage Works near Pietermaritzburg has revealed a significant increase in the numbers of Dark-capped Yellow Warblers from May to September. The locally resident breeding representatives at Darvill muster far fewer numbers during the summer months. The solitary individuals that sometimes turn up in places where they are not usually seen probably are wandering migrant birds.</p><p>The nests are usually sited rather low down (less than one metre above the ground) in dense cover. They are bound with broad strips of grass to two or three plant stems, or the fork of a shrub. Such nests are very visible to ground-dwelling predators such as mongooses that tend to rove about under dense vegetation, but the breeding success of Dark-capped Yellow Warblers has not been estimated. They do sometimes double-brood, with a second nest often built close to, or in the same shrub as the original one.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>With its erectile hind-crown feathers and cheerfully vociferous demeanour, this bulbul is likely to be one of the first species seen or heard by any visiting birder, for it is among the most widespread and abundant of African birds. As with any widespread bird, it is known by different names in different regions, but the current use of ‘Dark-capped’ is a poor way to describe it, because all of the Pycnonotus bulbuls (which we colloquially call ‘toppies’) have dark caps. The traditional name of ‘Black-eyed Bulbul’ better distinguishes it from the other two southern African Pycnonotus species, giving that all share similar appearance and behaviour but are distinguishable by the colour of their orbital wattles.</p><p>To say that this bulbul is not the fruit growers’ and gardeners’ favourite bird is probably an understatement. Some 75% of its diet comprises fruit, with flowers (mainly consumed for their nectar content) making up a further 15% and invertebrates the remaining 10%. In addition to wild berries and drupes small enough for it to swallow, this bulbul is known to eat a comprehensive range of fruits grown for human consumption, including apple, apricot, avocado, banana, fig, grape, guava, mango, olive, orange, papaya, peach, pear, plum – and this is not a complete list. However, while it is always easy to estimate (in terms of reduced crop yield) the damage done by such birds, it is impossible to measure the beneficial effects of their consumption of harmful insect pests such as fruit flies and codling moths. In their quest for nectar, they also play a beneficial role as pollinators. This is especially the case with large, winter-flowering aloes such as Aloe marlothii.</p><p>To say that this bulbul is not the fruit growers’ and gardeners’ favourite bird is probably an understatement.

In their quest for nectar, they also play a beneficial role as pollinators. This is especially the case with large, winter-flowering aloes such as Aloe marlothii.</p><p>Dark-capped Bulbuls don’t only like it sweet, they also like it hot, because they have a predilection for chillies. In Ndumo Game Reserve (on the Mozambique border of KwaZulu-Natal), a small red capsicum grows abundantly in the undergrowth of the Fever Tree forest, and I have watched Dark-capped Bulbuls regularly feeding on the fire-engine-red fruits, some birds swallowing four or five chillies in about 30 seconds.</p><p>Pairs of Dark-capped Bulbuls form close bonds and manifest this in many ways. They have attractive greeting ceremonies involving wing raising and bowing, often followed by allopreening. At the roost they perch together on the same twig with bodies touching. They are not aggressive by nature except when another bird, by chance or design, comes too close to their nest.</p><p>They bathe frequently, irrespective of weather conditions, usually in standing water in puddles, birdbaths or gutters. Bathing is characteristically an ‘in-out’ affair, in which the bird hops into the water, dips its breast and gives one or two splashes with its wings, hops out to the edge or rim of the puddle or bath, rapidly shivers its plumage, then enters the water again for another couple of splashes, and so on, until it finally flies off to a perch to preen. When there is no standing water available, they resort to foliage-bathing in rain-soaked or dew-laden vegetation.</p><p>Dark-capped Bulbuls are among the first to spot a predator such as a snake or mongoose, and their ratchet-like alarm call quickly draws a host of other birds to form a mobbing party. Males have sizeable call repertoires comprising their own unique phrases as well as copies of neighbouring individuals’ calls. This enables thriving suburban bulbul populations to form their own neighbourhood watch, because every territory owner knows the calls of his neighbours, so an incoming bulbul with unfamiliar calls is immediately identified as an intruder.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The two chanting goshawks occurring in southern Africa are arid- and mesic mirror images of each other, having complementary ranges that narrowly overlap in an extensive belt stretching from northern South Africa through Botswana to the Zambezi Region. The two look much alike, and in the contact zone one needs a careful look to see which bird is which. The Dark Chanting Goshawk is the mesic species, and its preferred habitat is mature woodland, from tall marula-knobthorn savanna to Mopane, Teak and Miombo Woodland. In contrast to the Pale Chanting Goshawk its range extends across the vast savanna belt of sub-Saharan Africa, reaching Ethiopia and Senegal. The southernmost edge of this range is in the lowveld of Swaziland.</p><p>Despite its extensive range, and in contrast to its Pale sister species, the Dark Chanting Goshawk is not a well-known bird. It is a sedentary species, and pairs probably maintain year-round territories; evidence of this is that one often finds individual birds frequenting a given site over time. In two areas, one in the South African lowveld, the other in lowveld in Zimbabwe, the density of nesting pairs was determined as 37 and 57 square kilometres per pair, respectively. These are far lower densities than those recorded for the Pale Chanting Goshawk, suggesting that the supporting prey base in the woodland doesn’t match that found in the arid west. It has a very varied diet that includes small mammals such as squirrels, mongooses and rodents, birds ranging in size between queleas and guineafowl, lizards, snakes and insects, but which of these make up the bulk of its diet is unknown.</p><p>Despite its extensive range, and in contrast to its Pale sister species, the Dark Chanting Goshawk is not a well-known bird.

Because of the wooded nature of their habitat, though, they are much less conspicuous than the Pale Chanting Goshawk and they are easily overlooked. They hunt from such positions, surveying the surroundings for prey and swooping down when an unsuspecting lizard, bird, or small mammal ventures within range. It is reported that they also follow honey badgers and foraging Southern Ground Hornbills on occasion, using them as beaters and getting to whatever is flushed ahead of the pack. Carrion, often in the form of a road kill, is another source of food that is exploited where available.</p><p>What often gives away the presence of these birds is their vocal activity. Both sexes call frequently, especially in the early morning when they utter their musical ‘chanting’ whistling call from high perches. It is a far-carrying sound and probably serves as an advertisement of their occupation of the territory. Pairs nest in the same places annually, usually building a new nest each season. It is a smallish platform of sticks in the fork of a tree and, in true chanting goshawk fashion, they add unusual things to the nest lining – rags, dung, seed pods, old birds nests that incorporate cobwebs, and so on. Like the Gabar Goshawk, they may also incorporate living parts of the nests of social spiders, and these then expand over the course of the nesting cycle to festoon much of the nest.</p><p>Dark and Pale Chanting Goshawks are most easily distinguished when seen in flight as the diagnostic secondary feathers and the rump are then visible; in the former the secondaries are grey (not white) and the rump is barred, not plain white. When the birds are perched, the overall shading of the two differs, Dark Chanting Goshawks being a few tones darker than Pale Chanting Goshawks, and the pale secondaries in the latter’s wing can still be discerned when the wing is folded. The juveniles of the two species are less easily distinguished, even in flight, as there is no colour difference in their secondaries. Juvenile Pale Chanting Goshawks do have whiter rumps, however, and this is probably the best distinction in the field.</p>",

There are three subspecies of this distinguished bird, all fittingly named after equally distinguished British establishment figures of the time: Edward Stanley (Earl of Derby), Lt&#160;Col&#160;Dixon Denham and Sir Fredrick Jackson, the last two being prominent African colonial administrators.</p><p>Two races occur locally. Neotis d. stanleyi is near endemic to South Africa, extending marginally to southern Mozambique and western Swaziland. It also wanders occasionally into Lesotho. Coastal populations of this species, e.g. in the southern Cape littoral plain, appear sedentary, but populations breeding in grasslands at higher elevations evidence seasonal altitudinal movements to lower-lying areas in winter, including into Karoo regions, where they overlap with Ludwig’s Bustard, and into lightly-wooded bushveld.</p><p>Two races occur locally.

Female Denham’s have finely barred forenecks, which in the males are either plain or lightly streaked. Males in all three of our large bustards are also typically, and usually dramatically, larger in size than the females. This is not always easy to discern in the field, though, especially when the birds are seen at a distance, alone or in single-sex flocks.</p><p>Most large bustard species, including Denham’s, tend to form single-sex groups when flocking. The weight of individual bustards varies considerably depending on season and local food supplies. In Denham’s, for example, females have been found to weigh between 2 kg and 6 kg (usually 3-4 kg), while males weigh between 5 kg and an astonishing 14 kg (usually 7-9 kg).</p><p>The nuptial display of the male Denham’s Bustard is the most striking of the three large southern African bustards. The billowing pure-white balloon of the erected neck and chest feathers is visible over 2 km away. Sometimes several males will loosely gather in the same area to display, in what is termed an ‘exploded lek’, but just as often displaying males will be spotted alone. The vocal prowess of this species, by contrast, lags far behind that of its two relatives. I observed a displaying male at fairly close range in the Humansdorp area of the Eastern Cape and although it repeatedly went through a distinctive and strenuous motion similar to that performed by Ludwig’s Bustard when producing the explosive booming call characteristic of that species, to my disappointment only a dismal and barely audible popping noise emerged, which sounded hardly worth the effort.</p><p>Like most bustards, Denham’s Bustard is polygamous and does not form pair bonds. Females are attracted to male display sites purely for fertilisation, and subsequently disperse to incubate their eggs and raise their chicks alone. This emancipation of males from parental care largely explains the extreme sexual size dimorphism and spectacular male displays in all large bustard species.</p><p>The southernmost (stanleyi) race of Denham’s Bustard is formally threatened, with an estimated population of less than 5&#160;000 individuals. Its distribution overlaps with areas heavily impacted by humans. The major threats come in the form of habitat destruction, human disturbance and, like its cousin, Ludwig’s Bustard, collisions with overhead lines and entanglement in fences. I will never forget the appalling sight of an adult male Denham’s Bustard in full breeding plumage strung up like a butcher’s carcass on a barbed-wire fence in the Bredasdorp area of the Western Cape&#9;</p>",

With most of the colourful, easily identified species ticked in my adolescent notebooks, I turned my attention to the region’s overwhelming plethora of ‘Little Brown Jobs’. For my first attempts, I visited a patch of grassland on the outskirts of Pretoria, where I spent many afternoons ignoring my school homework, instead systematically sorting out the more common and confiding LBJs.</p><p>Soon my efforts were thwarted by an enigmatic pair of tiny, grey-brown birds. The most perplexing piece of the puzzle was that the pair was feeding a fledgling about twice their size. The chick also differed in colour, markings and bill shape. After hours of stealthy observation and frenzied research, I was able to solve the mystery: I had found a pair of Desert Cisticolas that had been duped by the parasitic Cuckoo Finch.</p><p>Soon my efforts were thwarted by an enigmatic pair of tiny, grey-brown birds.

After hours of stealthy observation and frenzied research, I was able to solve the mystery: I had found a pair of Desert Cisticolas that had been duped by the parasitic Cuckoo Finch.</p><p>Subsequently I was surprised to discover how abundant the Desert Cisticola is in open, semi-arid grasslands, old agricultural fields and other sparse, dry grassland types. It is primarily a bird of open savanna, sweet grassland with scattered bushes, grassy areas in the Karoo and Kalahari, and arid grasslands in Namibia. It is often replaced by the Zitting Cisticola in moist grassland near water; that being said, it is not unusual to find these species virtually side by side, or even up to seven cisticola species in the same area – a considerable identification challenge!</p><p>The key to locating and confidently identifying cisticolas is to memorise their diagnostic songs. In the case of Desert, this is an evenly pitched repetition of short, sharp whistles at a rate of 3-5 per second. When alarmed, the birds switch to more raspy notes interspersed with audible wing snaps. They are particularly vociferous when their nests are approached. The nest is hidden in a dense grass tuft, about 10-15 cm above the ground, and is constructed with dry grass blades bound together with spider web. The nest is similar to that of the Zitting Cisticola, but has a shorter upward-facing entrance tunnel.</p><p>Desert Cisticolas are mostly resident, although they do wander nomadically in response to rainfall, grass height and veld fires. They are encountered singly or in pairs, but adjacent pairs may nest in close proximity and tend to form small, loose groups after breeding. Although most often seen perched on tall grass stalks or atop small bushes, Desert Cisticolas spend much time hopping about on the ground or clambering through low grass cover, where they hunt insects and spiders.</p><p>Three subspecies have been described: kalahari occurs throughout most of South Africa, extending into southern Botswana and Namibia; caliginus inhabits the moist eastern parts of South Africa and sandy grasslands in Mozambique; and eremicus occupies the northern parts of the region. These subspecies differ subtly in colour, with western birds being paler and greyer, and eastern birds darker and richer. Outside our borders, the Desert Cisticola’s distribution extends to arid grasslands in Tanzania and Ethiopia and westwards into the Sahel region. &#9;</p>",

This chunky little falcon is the eastern counterpart of the Grey Kestrel Falco ardosiaceus, and shares many qualities with that species. Both are predominantly grey (although Dickinson’s has a conspicuously two-tone plumage, with a markedly paler head and rump, which conveniently sets it apart from all other predominantly grey-coloured falcons in the region), both have a boxy-headed, upright stance (although Grey Kestrel has a noticeably heavier bill), both favour moist savanna, including palm savanna where it occurs in their respective ranges, and both are quite hawk-like in their build and brisk flight attitude.</p><p>Dickinson’s Kestrel only occurs around the northern and eastern periphery of southern Africa, in low-lying, tropical savanna, and particularly along the bigger floodplains scattered with Hyphaene and Borassus palms, such as the Kafue flats in Zambia. It also favours landscapes populated by large Baobab Trees. Where they have been closely observed and monitored, breeding pairs seem to be territorial and present at their territories year-round. However, increases in the frequency of sightings in northern Botswana and Zimbabwe during winter could be indicative of seasonal movement, perhaps from higher density areas to the north.</p><p>Dickinson’s Kestrel only occurs around the northern and eastern periphery of southern Africa, in low-lying, tropical savanna, and particularly along the bigger floodplains scattered with Hyphaene and Borassus palms, such as the Kafue flats in Zambia.

It can also hunt on the wing, is quite often seen foraging around the fringes of bush fires, and is even (reluctantly) capable of hover-hunting like a true kestrel where the pickings are rich enough and the perches are few. Prey is generally taken on or close to the ground, and includes terrestrial arthropods, and small rodents, reptiles and birds. I have watched one hunting from a transmission pylon near Shingwedzi in the north of the Kruger National Park, South Africa, making strikes from a perch about 10 m up, over distances of 20-40 m into long, dry grass. After a couple of failures, the bird emerged from the grass with a Kurrichane Buttonquail Turnix sylvatica, which it carried easily back to the pylon, and quickly processed and ate.</p><p>This is a cavity-nesting bird, and lays eggs in enclosed spaces in the crowns of savanna palms, hollows high up on the trunks of Baobabs or large, dead trees, in Hamerkop nests, and even in recesses in man-made structures. Up to five eggs are laid, usually in spring, and the young birds become conspicuous around the cavity entrance about two months later. Breeding is peripheral to southern Africa, and where it occurs the density of nesting pairs is generally very low, with pairs spaced over 10 km apart in north-eastern South Africa, compared with an average inter-nest distance of only around 275 m in Kafue, Zambia.</p>",

Like its relatives, it is a brood parasite, but has taken this unusual breeding strategy to an uncanny level of sophistication.</p><p>First however, let’s dispense with the ‘mundane’ but essential cuckoo attributes of this species. It is an intra-African migrant, present during our summer; it is an obligate brood parasite, with a wide range of host species; it has a relatively short incubation period, and the cuckoo chick evicts the host’s chicks from the nest; it imprints on the foster parents, but manages to identify conspecifics for the purpose of procreation; and eventually the fledgling flies all the way back to Equatorial Africa, without parental guidance!</p><p>First however, let’s dispense with the ‘mundane’ but essential cuckoo attributes of this species.

Its top three hosts are Southern Red Bishop, Southern Masked Weaver and Cape Sparrow. If the female cuckoo lays her egg in the nest of a Southern Red Bishop, it will be plain blue, virtually identical to those of the host; if she lays her egg in the weaver nest, it will match those of the weaver; and of course, the same applies if she parasitises a Cape Sparrow nest! This is egg mimicry par excellence! How can this be possible?</p><p>Our first thought towards an explanation is invariably superficial – perhaps the female looks at the eggs as she enters the nest, hurriedly applies a last coat of colouring and lays the matching egg! This is not only physiologically implausible, but rather lacking in imagination too – the real answer is much more incredible and all the more fascinating for its simplicity. Central to the explanation is an understanding of the concept of a gens which is a group of birds, all of which parasitise the same host species. A single female cuckoo does not randomly lay successive eggs in the nests of any or all of the described hosts for the species – she seeks out only one host type viz. that species which acted as her foster parents.</p><p>Thus we get the picture that there are several gentes of Dideric Cuckoos, with females targeting a specific host and laying eggs matching those of the host. A female cuckoo hatched in a Red Bishop nest will always return to parasitise the bishop (having imprinted on this species as a chick). Through natural selection, these cuckoos’ eggs have come to closely resemble those of the bishop – obviously there will be less chance of the cuckoo’s egg being discriminated against if it looks just like the host’s own eggs. Similarly in the case of females hatched in weaver or sparrow nests.</p><p>Female cuckoos which target Southern Masked Weaver nests face a challenge from the fact that the weaver eggs are so variable. How does the female cuckoo know which nest has eggs which match her own? Apparently she doesn’t! Studies have shown that mismatches can be twice as frequent as matches. Obviously, however, parasitism of this host still works well for the cuckoo.</p><p>If you are now asking yourself why the Dideric Cuckoo does not speciate (split) into several new species under the selection pressures exerted by the different hosts, you are thinking in a more scientific, rational way! The reason is that the males are not subject to the same evolutionary forces. A male hatched in a sparrow nest may mate with a female raised by any of the cuckoo’s hosts, and this mixing of genes unifies the cuckoo population.</p><p>The more that scientists unravel the complexities of nature, the greater – not lesser – becomes our appreciation of our marvellous living world. &#9;</p>",

In Botswana population shifts of varying magnitude are related to rainfall which may be very patchy. Occasionally birds may move into an area following a period of exceptional rainfall. The density of birds in western Botswana appeared much higher than that found in central Namibia. The population size of our birds is unknown but is possibly in excess of 50&#160;000.</p><p>A two-season ringing study at Mwaku Pan, in which a total of 68 birds were captured, with only eight ever recaptured, gives an indication of the very nomadic nature of this population. Of these, two were recaptured within a few days, six within a month and only one in the following season. This last bird, in contrast to the Spotted Thick-knee, showed barely any weight loss in the following year despite this being an extreme drought year.</p><p>There appears to have been little change in the range and population size in southern Africa, and the bird has adapted well to stock-farming practices and, locally, to crop farming. Its preference is for flat, stony and gravelly desert and semi-desert plains, usually with a scattering of low bushes, also firm, sandy soils, thorn scrub, dry river beds and pans in arid and semi-arid areas. It is normally found singly or in family parties of three to four, which probably includes the chick from an earlier breeding attempt.</p><p>They may breed in almost any month of the year, with the peak August to December, although avoiding periods of rainfall. In this respect they are opportunistic breeders and may breed following the scant, irregular rainfall in the very dry areas. They lay a single egg, and in the hottest months of the year the bird will then crouch over the egg rather than close-brooding, with their bill open for gular fluttering to help cool its blood. They normally lay right out in the open but one bird, near my Mwaku Pan camp in Botswana, laid its egg close to the upright soccer goalpost where it could obtain a minimum of shade during the middle of the day. I am not totally sure but I think that the chicks, once hatched, are quickly moved to the shade of bushes as they are mainly found close to such situations at night when they feed actively. Other nests found in Botswana were close to a tussock or small bush, possibly to break up the bird’s outline. One nest was found on the middle ‘mannetjie’ of a track which proved a good strategy, as the wheel ruts filled with water during a rainstorm.</p>",

The tail is rounded, lacking the pointed central tail feathers of Namaqua Sandgrouse. The female is similar to the female Namaqua Sandgrouse, but has a barred, not streaked, upper breast and, as in the male, a rounded tail.</p><p>Fairly widespread across the southern African savannas and Mopane woodlands, these sandgrouse are only really abundant in northern Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and along the Limpopo River system: it is the only sandgrouse species to occur in southern Mozambique. In the drier, western parts of their range they prefer rocky areas such as hill slopes or gravel plains, often far less vegetated than their favoured habitats further east.</p><p>Fairly widespread across the southern African savannas and Mopane woodlands, these sandgrouse are only really abundant in northern Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and along the Limpopo River system: it is the only sandgrouse species to occur in southern Mozambique. In the drier, western parts of their range they prefer rocky areas such as hill slopes or gravel plains, often far less vegetated than their favoured habitats further east.</p><p>Double-banded Sandgrouse are largely sedentary, although they do move about in search of water, especially in the dry season. The distances flown between feeding, watering and roosting sites are probably shorter than those travelled by Namaqua and Burchell’s Sandgrouse. Unlike the other three southern African sandgrouse, which are largely morning drinkers, they drink at sunset, often staying at the watering site until after dark. Birds approach the watering site by dodging and weaving through short trees so that their presence is not obvious until they arrive safely at the water. They then flutter like large moths before dropping to the water’s edge. They are also less vocal in flight than the other sandgrouse which, coupled with their evening drinking habit, make them much less conspicuous, even where they are common. Their take-off call is a harsh ‘chuck-chuck’, but otherwise they are fairly quiet while flying. On the ground at the drinking site they are more vocal, giving a musical and rapid, seven- to ten-syllable ‘pitee YOU’RE iti pur’. When disturbed, they sometimes give a growling ‘churr’.</p><p>Largely inactive during the day, resting cryptically in the shadows of scrubby vegetation, Double-banded Sandgrouse feed in the cooler hours of the morning and evening, even into moonlit nights. They eat the seeds of herbs and annual weeds. Although their diet is similar to that of other sandgrouse, they have a different feeding strategy, searching smaller areas more thoroughly.</p><p>The breeding season is from May to October, but varies across their range. Most breeding activity, however, is during the drier months, peaking during August in the Limpopo River system and from April to June in northern Botswana and Namibia. Like other sandgrouse, they are monogamous, solitary nesters, with pairs breeding more independently than the loose colonies of Namaqua Sandgrouse. The nest is a scrape in the soil, sparsely lined with dry vegetation, and often well concealed in vegetation. Unlike most other sandgrouse, they do not have the strict incubating routine of female by day and male by night. Rather, the female incubates at night and the male contributes to incubation during the day. Surprisingly for such a common and widespread bird, the incubation period is unrecorded in the wild, but in captivity it is 23 to 24 days.</p><p>An aspect of conservation concern is that they are hunted, particularly in Botswana, as an added quarry alongside game hunts in the cooler winter months, which straddle the birds’ breeding season. Also of some concern is that this hunting takes place when they are approaching their drinking site at dusk, which means that if birds are prevented from drinking at that site, they may go the night without drinking. If they miss the evening drink they may return at dawn the next morning.</p>",

These plants are common along drainage lines and in the rangelands and are an almost ideal nest site, retaining some dead leaves that the sunbirds often incorporate into the nest, effectively camouflaging it. Dusky Sunbirds occur in semi-arid coastal plains with sand dunes and rocky inselbergs, provided there is some cover, and they occupy noorsveld, dominated by Noors Euphorbia coerulescens in the Eastern Cape Province.</p><p>Their tolerance to habitat transformation is uncertain, but the birds do feed at plants unpalatable to domestic livestock in rangelands transformed by overgrazing. Dusky Sunbirds also occur in farmstead and village gardens, especially where there are aloes and crassulas. Their food includes nectar and invertebrates. Nectar is taken from a variety of wild and cultivated (garden) plants. Aloes are favoured, including creeping and low upright aloes, taller aloes such as the Mountain Aloe Aloe marlothii, and tree aloes such as the Quiver Tree Aloe dichotoma. Flowers of other plants  visited, cover several growth forms, including tall shrubs, such as Wild Dagga Leonotis leonuris, small succulents and mistletoes. Alien flowers such as cannas, Cherry-pie Lantana camara and especially Wild Tobacco Nicotiana glauca also are visited. Along drainage lines in arid areas that have been invaded by Wild Tobacco, the abundance of Dusky Sunbird males is much higher than in similar areas with no tobacco, suggesting that the sunbirds are adaptable foragers, a useful characteristic in a largely nomadic bird.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Dwarf Bittern is a strong contender for the title of the world’s smallest heron. Its length (25 cm) indicates this and so does its weight (140 g). In terms of wingspan it lies somewhere between a Cape Turtle Dove and a Red-eyed Dove, and when seen in flight one’s first take of its shape and all-dark upperparts might be: ‘Is it perhaps a Speckled Pigeon?’ The bird is restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, with a range that extends across the savanna belt from Senegal to South Africa. Nowhere across this extensive range, apparently, are Dwarf Bitterns resident, and in southern Africa it is clearly a summer visitor, arriving in the savannas on seasonal wetlands after good rains have led to local flooding.</p><p>It is a floodplain and seasonal wetland specialist and the speed at which these birds find such areas is remarkable – colonising places which, a few weeks before were waterless, dusty depressions. Within days of inundation, Dwarf Bitterns are there, easily detected by the hoarse barking calls of the males as they jostle to stake out a breeding site and to attract a mate. Much of this calling is done at dusk or after dark, and it is likely that their commuting between wetlands and arrival at a site is also done during the night. In dry summers when little or no inundation occurs, Dwarf Bitterns fail to materialise and it is an enigma how the birds know when to come, and when not to come.</p><p>It is a floodplain and seasonal wetland specialist and the speed at which these birds find such areas is remarkable – colonising places which, a few weeks before were waterless, dusty depressions.

In dry summers when little or no inundation occurs, Dwarf Bitterns fail to materialise and it is an enigma how the birds know when to come, and when not to come.</p><p>The other small bittern in the region, the Little Bittern, also utters a barking call; the note it uses is much like that of the Dwarf Bittern, a husky ‘rhuut’ or ‘gogh’, but it repeats these at about two-second intervals whereas the Dwarf Bittern utters the note at half-second intervals. The call has the same resonance as the hooting of a Speckled Pigeon and at a distance it could be mistaken for the bark of a dog. Males perch on the top of potential nesting trees to call, and they adopt a hunched posture, raising their mantle feathers and inflating their throats as they call. The sexes are alike, and in both male and female the lores acquire an almost luminous turquoise colour at this time. Once mates are secured and nesting gets under way the birds become silent and are then much less detectable/noticeable. Nesting pairs are often loosely associated; for example, several may nest in adjacent trees 10 or 20 m apart, but they are not colonial as such.</p><p>The nesting cycle is a quick affair. Within days of arrival and mates being secured the nest is built, a flimsy saucer-shaped platform of twigs placed over water, typically in the lower branches of a temporarily flooded tree or bush. Before the last twig is added egg-laying commences, and before the clutch is completed incubation gets under way. Four to five eggs are usually laid, one a day, and the hatching of these is staggered – the first-laid hatching several days before the last-laid. Incubation takes, on average, 20 days and both sexes share this, changing over at intervals during the day. Growth and fledging of the chicks is likewise remarkably rapid when compared with that in other herons. Within a week of hatching the featherless, down-covered young clamber from the nest into the branches if disturbed, and at less than two weeks old they leave the nest permanently, waiting in the branches of the tree for food to be brought in by the parents. Small frogs appear to be the primary food source but small fish, aquatic insects, spiders, crustaceans and other live prey is also taken. Well before the summer is over and the wetlands start drying, the nesting cycle is complete, and this wetland will-’o-the-wisp disappears until another summer and the next flood event. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Generally uncommon throughout its range, the Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon has a fragmented distribution from Kenya south to South Africa. In southern Africa, it now occurs only in discontinuous forest patches along the eastern escarpment, at Mt Gorongosa, Mozambique, and in coastal lowlands south to about East London, Eastern Cape. Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeons are usually seen alone or in groups of up to 30 in the canopies of tall trees, sometimes in mixed flocks with African Olive Pigeons.</p><p>It is uncertain how common or rare the Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon may be south of about Karkloof, near Pietermaritzburg (where it is nevertheless rare). It was present, possibly even common, at Port St John’s in the early 1900s. H. H. Swinny, who contributed a large number of bird specimens to the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History (formerly the Transvaal Museum and Northern Flagship Institution), collected three specimens of Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeons there in four days in April 1908. The only other specimen records are from Durban (the type locality), Mtunzini and Karkloof in KwaZulu-Natal, and Sokose in Zimbabwe. There is no reliable estimate of population size of this species in South Africa, but there are estimates of numbers in certain forests – about 100 birds in Ongoye Forest; 40-60 birds in Ntumeni Nature Reserve; 12 birds in Dhinza Forest; and eight birds in the Karkloof Forest.</p><p>It is uncertain how common or rare the Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon may be south of about Karkloof, near Pietermaritzburg (where it is nevertheless rare).

Their tolerance for transformed habitats appears to be low, although they do occur in alien pine plantations in Zimbabwe. The birds are categorised as Vulnerable in South Africa because of the fragmentation of forests and the decrease in the area of forest patches (partly due to gradual erosion of forest edges by fire), and forest disturbance through the increasing harvesting of understorey medicinal plants and grazing by cattle in the forests. However, in South Africa most of the important forest habitats for this species are within protected areas.</p><p>The food of the Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon is mainly fruit, and includes a range of forest and forest-edge species such as Broad-leaved Yellowwood Podocarpus latifolius, Pigeonwood Trema orientalis, River Macaranga Macaranga capensis, Sand Onionwood Cassipourea malosana, Tree Fuschia Halleria lucida, and fruits of wild figs and mistletoes. The fruits of Forest Knobwood Zanthoxylum davyi are important in the diet in late summer and autumn. Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeons forage mainly in the early morning and evening, flapping noisily in the canopy of fruiting trees.</p><p>Nesting in Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeons is poorly known in southern Africa and not very well known anywhere. The courtship display has only been briefly described, and apparently follows the standard pigeon and dove pattern with the male displaying to the female and ‘cooing‘. The nest is built by the female, using twigs collected by the male in the canopy of a nearby tree. Like male African Olive Pigeons, but unlike most other pigeons and doves, male Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeons break twigs off the tree rather than collecting fallen twigs. Although there are a few nest records from East Africa, only one authentic nest is known from southern Africa. This was placed in slender branches high in the canopy of a Forest Ironplum Drypetes gerrardii, at least 20 metres above ground, screened above by leaves, and well concealed from below. The nestlings were fed by both parents.&#9;</p>",

They are resident and sedentary, occupying upland grassland and mixed shrubland and grassland, being most common on rocky ridges or on the tops of rolling hills. Their conspicuous aerial displays and year-round territoriality mean that they are more frequently seen than other co-occurring lark species, even though they usually occur at lower densities than these species. Their tolerance towards habitat transformation is unknown, but likely to be low. Indeed, there are no records of Eastern Long-billed Larks in cultivated lands, even though much of the species’ range covers the high rainfall grasslands, most of which have been transformed into croplands.</p><p>The Eastern Long-billed Lark is the smallest and shortest billed species in the long-billed lark species-group, usually making its presence known by its call or combination of aerial display and call. Males sing (and display) all year round, but do so most during the pre-breeding period when territories are being advertised or established. The song is a loud, far-carrying, descending whistle, ‘peeeuuuu’, lasting up to a second and given from the ground, from a low perch or in aerial display. When given from a perch, the song is repeated, monotonously, every eight to 15 seconds. In aerial display the male leaves a low perch and flies fast and close to the ground, suddenly rising near-vertically with closed wings to about 15 metres above ground. He then stalls, gives the far-carrying whistle, and falls vertically with wings closed until just before the ground, then resumes horizontal flight, sometimes repeating the vertical climb, stall, call and dive before perching again. Male Eastern Long-billed Larks, like other long-billed larks, often sing softly while walking or foraging, and when perched give a series of low-pitched, burry, rolling whistles ‘churr-wee-wurr’ or ‘pee-hee-hee’. It is uncertain whether these lower-pitched calls are given by the male only or also by the female.</p><p>The Eastern Long-billed Lark is the smallest and shortest billed species in the long-billed lark species-group, usually making its presence known by its call or combination of aerial display and call.

It is a cup of dead grass leaves, lined with fine blades of grass, with a broad apron of pebbles in front of the nest. It is placed in a hollow, perhaps excavated by the birds, under the edge of a grass tuft or sheltering stone, but the nest is not domed.

Like the Spur-winged Goose, it is actually a duck that has developed goose-like habits but it is not a goose. It has become well adapted to man-made environments and has even become an urban bird where there is suitable habitat such as golf courses and parks. We even have a pair that nests in the suburb of Denneoord in George, and when their eggs hatch they walk their chicks down Ninth Street to get them to the stream at the bottom.</p><p>The male and female are similar-looking birds with brown backs and grey underparts, with a distinct white bar on the wing, and they are big birds, larger than most of our ducks. They are found over most of southern Africa and indeed over almost all of Africa, south and east of the Sahara Desert, being absent only from areas of extreme aridity or from dense rain forests. Interestingly, these birds are able to use the intertidal coastal areas and rock pools for feeding, and will even take their chicks into the sea to escape approaching danger.</p><p>The male and female are similar-looking birds with brown backs and grey underparts, with a distinct white bar on the wing, and they are big birds, larger than most of our ducks.

When threatened, both sexes hiss loudly. When nesting, they are extremely aggressive, particularly towards other Egyptian Geese but also to potential predators of their nests and chicks.</p><p>They have adapted successfully to utilising man’s crops, especially cereals and lucerne. In the Little Karoo, lucerne lands may have many hundreds of this species eating the fresh green lucerne shoots. They certainly cause considerable damage to the crops under these circumstances. They are most common or even abundant in the southern and western Cape, but are also common in many other parts of southern Africa.</p><p>Although essentially a ground-nesting species, these birds have adapted extremely well to utilising a variety of nest sites. They will nest on ledges on cliffs; they also use old hamerkop nests and are known for usurping the nests of birds of prey. I once watched a pair of Egyptian Geese harassing a pair of nesting Wahlberg’s Eagles which were sitting on two eggs. The ducks kept flying into the eagles’ nest and landing on the edge until the Wahlberg’s Eagles eventually abandoned it to the Egyptian Geese.</p><p>At the Botanic Gardens in George there is a well-known Spotted Eagle Owl nest in a large pine tree. Over the years the Egyptian Geese have tried to obtain the nest in spring when the Eagle Owls are nesting. However, no amount of interference by the geese will get the owls out of the nest; should a ‘goose’ land on the edge of the nest, the brooding owl will turn on its back and present its taloned feet to the intruders. This is sufficient to keep the would-be usurpers out of the nest. However, once the Spotted Eagle Owls’ chicks leave the nest, the Egyptian Geese tend to take it over and breed there. When the eggs hatch in one of these aerial nests the chicks, encouraged by the calls of the female, jump out of the nest and fall to the ground; the chicks are light enough and soft enough to land on the ground without seriously injuring themselves.  They are then led away to the nearest water for safety. Interestingly, the ducklings do not need water and will thrive, provided there is plenty of fresh green grass or something similar on which they can feed.</p>",

Breeding pairs within these colonies then raise their young on transient passerines, picked off in mid-air as they labour across the sea from southern Europe during the autumn migration.

In the Eastern Cape the birds are most common in subtropical thicket vegetation types.</p><p>The birds are sometimes in pairs, seldom, if ever, in groups, and are most often seen foraging alone. On the ground they walk more rapidly than other doves. When flushed from these foraging sites, the birds rise with a clatter of wings, fly away with rather a zigzag flight pattern, and usually settle after a short distance, landing abruptly and raising their tails once or twice. They also forage on bare or sparsely vegetated ground along roadsides and gravel paths, and in clearings in woodland and around edges of dense shrubland. At Tzaneen in Limpopo Province, solitary Emerald-spotted Wood Doves frequently forage on rather bare patches in the shade within closed woodland and in similar sites under the thin shade of Bugweed Solanum mauritianum trees.</p><p>At Hluhluwe Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, the birds frequently forage in the dung middens of Square-lipped or White Rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum on the sides of the roads, almost certainly in search of grass seeds. Their food is not well known, but does include the small seeds of herbs and grasses, as well as small snails and termites. Fallen fruits of wild figs, Bugweed and Castor Oil Bush Ricinus communis are also eaten. At Soyo, in northern Angola, where the local subsistence crop is sesame seeds, Emerald-spotted Wood Doves regularly forage in the crop fields when the sesame plants are drying out and ready for harvest.</p><p>The birds are monogamous, territorial and regularly build nests in the same site if the nesting event was successful the previous season. Pair bonds between Emerald-spotted Wood Doves seem to be permanent or at least last for more than one or two breeding seasons. Courtship displays are virtually unknown, and only some elements of the display appear to have been observed. The ‘towering’ display, common to almost all species of doves and pigeons, is similar to that of other small forest doves. It involves a steep climb from a perch, and downward glide with outstretched wings and fanned tail.</p><p>The nest is a saucer-shaped platform of twigs, petioles and roots, usually placed fairly low down in a bush, tree, or on a coppicing stump. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, and the nestlings are fed and brooded by both parents. One adult that was brooding nestlings performed a rudimentary distraction display when disturbed from the nest: it flopped to the ground, fluttering and dragging its wings while moving away from the nest area.&#9;</p>",

On the other hand, it is quite easily confused with any one of the other scimitar-shaped, lightly built, fast-flying falcons that occur in southern Africa, namely African Hobby Falco cuvierii, Sooty Falcon Falco concolor and Eleonora’s Falcon Falco eleonorae. It’s worth noting, however, that at the right time of year, the Eurasian Hobby is more likely to be seen than these three scarce to very scarce vagrants. The main field characters to look for are the slight build, the very long wings (projecting well beyond the tip of the tail on the perched bird), the rufous vent feathers in the adult, with yellow facial skin, legs and feet. The legs are also relatively short, and the feet small and dainty.</p><p>Although it doesn’t occur commonly anywhere in the region, Eurasian Hobby is widely spread across much of the north and east, extending right down the coastal strip to the south-western Cape, and is regularly seen within this range at any time during the boreal winter, from about October to April. The breeding population is located peripherally in north-west Africa, centred in Eurasia, and extends east as far as eastern China and Japan. Satellite telemetry has shown that a central European bird, monitored through two complete migration cycles, travelled over 10 000 km south into Zimbabwe, covering up to 600 km per day when really on the move.

I have also found it to be particularly numerous along the Garden Route coast of South Africa, with summer influxes to the Alexandria dune field just east of Port Elizabeth seemingly an annual phenomenon. Here it’s possible to see a loose aggregation of as many as 10-20 birds, spread across &gt;10 000 ha of tall coastal dunes, hawking insects (and perhaps small birds) from perches on the dune crests out over the open sand. Most typically seen hunting in the early mornings and late evenings, it reputedly rests up in a shady tree during the heat of the day. It takes a range of airborne prey, from large insects (dragonflies, beetles, termite alates) to small birds (swifts and swallows, a variety of small passerines), and small, insectivorous bats. Very fast on the wing, they typically catch prey in rapid, keening aerial strikes, made either directly from a soaring position, or from a prominent perch, and may consume smaller prey on the wing before resuming hunting. It is often seen in association with other falcons on passage or at concentrations of prey, including flocks of Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni and Amur Falcon Falco amurensis at termite emergences or locust swarms, and other bird hunters at Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea outbreaks, or big roosts of Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica.</p>",

It has largely abandoned song and replaced it with a curious clapping sound given during a high and dipping display flight and produced mechanically by the wings apparently when they strike together under the body. This often muffled sound is vaguely reminiscent of a modern cell phone turned onto ‘vibration’ mode. Other lark species, covering several different genera, clap their wings in a relatively rudimentary fashion but the habit is best developed in the Mirafra larks, especially in the Flappet Lark and the two clapper larks.</p><p>Wing clapping in Flappet Larks has been studied by Åke Norberg using high-speed film of displaying birds in the Serengeti Plains of Tanzania. The rate at which the wings are clapped reaches an exhausting 24 times/second, more than double the normal wing-flapping rate and a rate more typical of a bird weighing 3 g, rather than the actual weight of 27 g. The species is not entirely mute, though, and at close range a brief, lilting and somewhat discordant whistling melody can be heard, tagged onto the end of the wing clattering and also occasionally uttered at other times. Mimicry has not been recorded for this species but should still be looked for.</p><p>Wing clapping in Flappet Larks has been studied by Åke Norberg using high-speed film of displaying birds in the Serengeti Plains of Tanzania. The rate at which the wings are clapped reaches an exhausting 24 times/second, more than double the normal wing-flapping rate and a rate more typical of a bird weighing 3 g, rather than the actual weight of 27 g. The species is not entirely mute, though, and at close range a brief, lilting and somewhat discordant whistling melody can be heard, tagged onto the end of the wing clattering and also occasionally uttered at other times. Mimicry has not been recorded for this species but should still be looked for.</p><p>Seen on the ground, the Flappet Lark, like most of its kin, is nondescript. There are four races in the region (and a further 11 elsewhere in Africa), a diversity that reflects the sedentary habits typical of Mirafra larks. The colour of the upperparts varies markedly, predominantly greyish in some areas and brownish in others. The upperparts also show the ‘generalised’ type of camouflage patterning described by Gordon Maclean. This involves highly variegated markings that are effective when contrasted against most complex background habitat types, compared with the ‘specialised’ plain upperparts of species such as Dune and Gray’s larks, the colour of which exactly matches the uniform hue of the largely open ground that comprises the habitats of those two species. Flappet Larks have distinct rufous colouration in the flight feathers, which is also visible in the folded wing, a feature typical of Mirafra larks.</p><p>The Flappet Lark is most similar in appearance to its closest relatives, the Cape and Eastern Clapper Larks, and it shares aspects of its distinct wing-clapping display with them. Its circular display flights are typically done higher up in the sky, driven by the need to rise above the tall trees typical of its habitat. Its distribution overlaps marginally with the Eastern Clapper Lark in far north-eastern Namibia and northern Botswana but the two are separated on a local scale by differential habitat choice.</p><p>The Flappet Lark is rivalled only by the Chestnut-backed Sparrow-lark as the most widespread African alaudid. It favours the most densely wooded habitats of all the southern African members of the family, especially broad-leaved woodland, including miombo and teak. It is localised to more open areas in these habitats, though, and also occurs in open coastal grasslands in Zululand. Over large parts of central Mozambique it is common despite being the only lark species present. It usually occurs on flat terrain but some populations inhabit hilly ground, such as in the Magaliesberg and the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe.</p><p>Breeding in the species is poorly studied. This lark is monogamous and territorial. The nest is placed on the ground against a grass tuft and is partially domed. As is found in many lark nests, there is an ‘apron’ of material deposited at the nest entrance. The clutch size is 2-3 marked eggs. The young are able to leave the nest as early as 11 days, well before they are able to fly.</p>",

Its large wings allow it to glide well, but make it quite buoyant, limiting its diving ability; most dives are only 3-5 metres deep. Birds from Lord Howe Island and northern New Zealand migrate into the North Pacific as far as Alaska, whereas those from St Paul Island and islands off south-west Australia disperse into the Indian Ocean. In southern Africa, they are most common off the east coast, especially off southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal, where they are often the most abundant birds attending fishing vessels. Small numbers reach the Cape and straggle up the west coast as far as the Namibian border. They occur year-round, being more abundant off the east coast in winter and off the Cape in summer. Single birds have come ashore at night on Dyer Island, just west of Cape Agulhas, in September-October. This coincides with the start of the breeding season, and presumably they were prospecting for potential nesting sites, but failed to attract mates. Small numbers are killed on fishing gear (mainly longlines) and some colonies are impacted by introduced predators, but with a total population of close to a million birds it is not listed as threatened.</p>",

It was formerly considered conspecific with the Mountain Buzzard, but it has now been given full species status.</p><p>Records of Forest Buzzards away from treed areas are always suspect because the migratory Steppe Buzzard is so varied in plumage, some individuals being pale below, that confusion is possible. The status of the Forest Buzzard is difficult to assess accurately and it may well have been underrecorded in atlas projects.</p><p>Records of Forest Buzzards away from treed areas are always suspect because the migratory Steppe Buzzard is so varied in plumage, some individuals being pale below, that confusion is possible. The status of the Forest Buzzard is difficult to assess accurately and it may well have been underrecorded in atlas projects.</p><p>Forest Buzzards are most readily seen on the coastal strip between George and Humansdorp, where there is a mix of natural forests and plantations interspersed with open patches of fynbos and cultivation. This is ideal habitat, and this area is thought to be the core of the species’ breeding range. There is as yet no evidence that the Forest Buzzards in the north-eastern part of their range breed there. Rather, they are thought to be winter migrants to these areas. Immature birds trapped in Limpopo and Kwa-Zulu Natal Provinces have been re-trapped near Knysna in the Western Cape – perhaps returning to their natal areas.</p><p>Birders in the town of George, where the Forest Buzzard is considered the common raptor, report at least three breeding pairs in the municipal area. They regularly soar over the town and are easily approachable when perched, which they regularly do on telephone poles: one has even been observed taking thrushes in a suburban garden. Generally, though, it is an unobtrusive species, often sitting still for long periods in forest trees.</p><p>It is only in the breeding season that Forest Buzzards really draw attention to themselves. This is when the male performs his aerial display with undulating flight and shrill calls. In the Marloth Nature Reserve near Swellendam, Western Cape, Forest Buzzards breed both in large indigenous trees within relict forest patches and in stands of alien Monterey Pines Pinus radiata. Nests built in the natural forests tend to be bulkier than those in alien trees. In either case, however, the nests are difficult to locate and, in spite of their size, can be hard to see.</p><p>In the south-western Western Cape the Forest Buzzard is a relative newcomer. In the 1950s it was not known from west of about George but it was well established in the Swellendam and Heidelberg regions by the mid-1970s, and a few years later had moved even further west, extending to the Cape Peninsula. Similar westward range extensions of both Black Sparrowhawks and African Goshawks occurred at around the same time.</p><p>Buzzards found nesting in areas where Forest Buzzards formerly bred, seem to be predominately dark brown or rufous birds, and the typically white-fronted Forest Buzzards have all but vanished. One can only speculate as to what is happening. The most likely explanation is that some migratory Steppe Buzzards are remaining behind (as happened earlier in the 20th Century with White Storks) and are hybridising with Forest Buzzards. Genetic studies indicate that Steppe and Forest Buzzards have only recently diverged from one another, and it is therefore quite possible that the two could hybridise. One wonders about the implications for the long-term survival of the endemic Forest Buzzard, not least because most of the buzzards breeding in the western part of the range of Forest Buzzard appear to be the new colonists, some of which have almost certainly hybridised with Forest Buzzards.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This canary is endemic to South Africa, but has close relatives in a suite of mainly forest-dwelling canaries inhabiting central Africa; these include the Black-faced and Citril Canaries, and also the Papyrus Canary. In my experience, the Forest Canary is more at home in mistbelt forests than in the warm subtropical forest types such as are found along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. These Afromontane communities, however, extend down to sea level in the Eastern and Western Cape where they are common garden birds. Inland, in Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces, this canary is typically found in the high escarpment forests.</p><p>The Forest Canary has expanded its range westward in the last few decades. In 1959, when C&#160;J&#160;Skead finished compiling The Canaries, Seedeaters and Buntings of Southern Africa, this canary was not known to occur west of the Caledon district (100 km east of the Cape Peninsula). In 1981 I walked into a forest fragment in the Kirstenbosch National Botanic Gardens and heard, to my surprise, a familiar ‘tseeloo-tswee-ee’ call. I did a little ‘spishing’, and a couple of Forest Canaries were soon fluttering about in nearby foliage to see what the noise was. The South Atlantic prevents further westerly expansion for this bird, but there is suitable habitat for it northwards, and it will be interesting to see if it extends its range to the slopes of the Cedarberg Mountains.</p><p>The Forest Canary has expanded its range westward in the last few decades.

The South Atlantic prevents further westerly expansion for this bird, but there is suitable habitat for it northwards, and it will be interesting to see if it extends its range to the slopes of the Cedarberg Mountains.</p><p>Forests do not provide well-stocked larders for small, seed-eating birds, which is why there are comparatively few forest seedeaters compared with the numerous species inhabiting grasslands and wooded savannas. I saw my first Forest Canaries in ‘Townbush’ at Pietermaritzburg. This hillside of dense secondary growth must have been a fine forest a few centuries ago before all the trees in it that could yield workable wood were felled. Coincidentally, it is the Forest Canary’s type locality (the place where the first described specimen was collected). I found a small group of these canaries busy pecking into the large fruits of a Broom-cluster Fig Tree Ficus sur. At first I was not sure whether they were after insect larvae in the fruit, but further observation revealed that they were eating the seeds and surrounding pulp. So Forest Canaries get some of their seeds from small forest fruits, most of which they find in the canopy or dense growth of the forest fringe.</p><p>In the southern Cape they are frequently encountered feeding in grasses growing along paths through the forest. They also range out of the forest into more open, adjacent areas where they can feast on the seeds of weedy growth, and especially on those of the daisy family (Compositae). They eat flowers such as those of the Cape Honeysuckle Tecoma capensis, as well as fresh leaf growth of certain trees and the succulent leaves of climbing Canary Creeper Senecio tamoides, which is a common forest edge plant.</p><p>In the breeding season the birds pair off, but when not breeding they are usually encountered in groups of from 5-16 birds. Like all seedeaters, they drink regularly, and they also bathe frequently, so favoured forest stream pools (usually overhung with foliage to provide shelter from predators such as the African Goshawk), are good places to see them.</p><p>Although the preferred forest habitat of this bird is under increasing threat outside of protected areas in South Africa, Forest Canaries seem fairly adaptable and have benefited from the establishment of commercial plantations. They also appear to be expanding their range in the Western Cape, so it is worth keeping an eye and ear open for them in appropriate habitat patches where they have yet to be recorded.</p>",

It is found almost throughout southern Africa, apart from the driest area in the west and the open grasslands in the centre. It is replaced by the Square-tailed Drongo in the forests of the east.</p><p>The Fork-tailed Drongo is one of the species in bird parties which move through our woodlands in the non-breeding season, searching mainly for insects. They are the most conspicuous species, partly because they are so noisy and partly because they perch out in the open to hawk insects disturbed by the foraging activities of the other birds in the party. They also are able to keep a sharp eye out for approaching danger.  If the drongos spot a bird of prey or some other type of predator, they give an alarm call which is taken up immediately by the other drongos and then all the birds just seem to vanish. They don’t actually fly away but disappear into the nearest thick cover where they sit absolutely still so that they cannot be detected. After about ten minutes the birds gradually reappear where they were before the alarm was given, and continue foraging. The drongos then again take up a position on a perch from which they can hawk flying insects.</p><p>The Fork-tailed Drongo is probably the most fearless, or perhaps most foolhardy, of all the small birds in the woodlands; it does not tolerate birds of prey near its nest.   They are always the first to mob a bird of prey when seen, or even something like a snake. Their noisy calls alert other birds which will join in mobbing the predator. I have watched a Fork-tailed Drongo riding on the back of a Wahlberg’s Eagle, pecking at the back of the eagle’s head, with the eagle trying desperately to dislodge the drongo from its back! However, when the drongo flies up out of the trees to intercept a Gymnogene flying over the woodland, the latter promptly drops into the trees to find the drongo’s nest and consume the chicks!</p><p>The Fork-tailed Drongo builds a basin-shaped hammock in a horizontal fork. It is interesting that they are the host for the African Cuckoo. One would not expect a cuckoo to parasitise a bird as aggressive as the drongo but perhaps the drongos are better able to look after the cuckoo chicks than less aggressive birds. The drongos know that the African Cuckoo is bad news and will try to chase them away from their nesting territory. The male African Cuckoo sits on the top of a tall tree in the woodland, usually on a perch exposed above the canopy. From there it gives its typical ‘cuc-cuck’ call for most of the day. It will act as a decoy to draw the drongos from the nest!</p><p>When the drongos start laying, the female African Cuckoo manages to lay its egg in the drongo’s nest. On one occasion I was lucky enough to see the drongos chasing after the male cuckoo that was calling about 150 metres or so from the drongo’s nest. We did not see the female cuckoo go to the drongo’s nest but two and a half weeks later there was a cuckoo chick in the drongo’s nest.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>With its freckled and mottled overall appearance, the Freckled Nightjar is aptly named. However, it could equally well go by the name of ‘Rock Nightjar’, as it is inextricably bound to areas in which rocks and boulders are dominant features: mountains and inselbergs, rocky outcrops and hillsides, woodland with flat rocky areas or boulders, gorges and escarpments, are its typical haunts. It is a dark-plumaged nightjar, with a broad, flattened head and enormous eyes. Weighing in at around 80 g, it is also one of the heaviest nightjars in our region.</p><p>The plumage of the Freckled Nightjar differs from that of most other southern African nightjars. Lacking the variegated plumage and rufous hind-neck collars of species that roost on leaf litter or amongst vegetation, it has an overall dark brown to dusky colouration, liberally freckled with lighter mottling and fine vermiculation. Its plumage thus lends it a legendary degree of camouflage, often enhanced by the presence of grey lichen on the rocks where it roosts and breeds. Behavioural adaptations, which include flattening its plumage and ‘moulding’ it to the surface, reinforce this remarkable disguise. Slight regional variation in colour occurs, with a tendency for birds to be matched closely to the colour of the local rocks.</p><p>The plumage of the Freckled Nightjar differs from that of most other southern African nightjars.

The loud, repeated ‘kwow wow!’ or ‘kwow wow wow!’, with the emphasis on the last notes, is the most reliable indication of its presence. In alarm and possibly in other contexts it gives a ‘wok … wok … wok …’,and in flight it repeatedly utters ‘chuck’ notes. Seeing Freckled Nightjars is more challenging than hearing them, but their habit of sitting on quiet country roads in hilly country at night may allow a sighting in the beams of a vehicle’s headlights. Unfortunately, this habit also makes them vulnerable to traffic, and casualties frequently occur.</p><p>Freckled Nightjars hunt at dusk and dawn or on moonlit nights over rocky areas and woodland adjacent to their roosting areas, favouring broad-leaved woodland such as miombo or mopane. They may sally out from a perch on rocks or branches or from the ground, capturing passing beetles, moths, grasshoppers, cockroaches and other flying insects. Their enormous gape allows them to swallow large insects with ease.</p><p>This species is largely sedentary, with the birds normally being found in their territories year-round, although some local movements may occur. There is strong fidelity between birds of a pair and they probably mate for life. They are also faithful to their territories, breeding in the same area, often on the same rock or even in the same niche on the rock from one year to the next. Between September and November the female lays two eggs in a shallow depression on rocks. She may endure intense heat, up to 60oC, while incubating the eggs or brooding her young in direct sunlight. Turning her back to the sun and gular fluttering minimises the tendency for overheating. The male shares incubation duties at night and when the grey, downy young hatch, both adults feed them. As the chicks grow they acquire white mottling, which renders their camouflage as effective as that of the adults.</p><p>Freckled Nightjars are not threatened, but they are regularly killed on roads and are often hunted by indigenous peoples who relish them to eat. Fires may cause habitat degradation and loss of suitable hunting areas. Together, these factors can lead to local extinctions.&#9;</p>",

It is noticeable that at such times they gather in huge numbers which then irrupt or move away from the breeding area into the surrounding country and may well colonise new areas. It is thought that this behaviour has contributed to their colonising so much of the tropical and subtropical world and its islands.</p><p>Outside of the breeding period the birds usually gather in small to large flocks, and will even join flocks of foraging White-faced Ducks to feed. Much foraging is done in the water where the birds may dabble or upend, or merely put their head under water to feed on plant material, particularly the young shoots of plants like the Wavy-leaved Pond Weed Potamogeton crispus. They do eat limited amounts of aquatic insects but these may be ingested with the plants on which they are feeding.</p><p>When conditions are right the flocks split up into pairs to breed. The birds excavate a basin-shaped hollow in the ground in which some lining is placed, usually well concealed under grasses or other vegetation. Although most nests are near the water, this species has been recorded as building nests up to 50 metres from the water. They normally lay 8-10 eggs and the eggs are incubated by both sexes, ensuring that the eggs are always covered unless the birds are disturbed. After the eggs have hatched, the parents lead the downy young to the nearest water, where they are capable of diving immediately if threatened. Breeding is mainly in summer but much depends on suitable rainfall filling wetlands.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In terms of familial ties, the Gabar Goshawk straddles the divide between chanting goshawks and accipiters. Its colouring, partially barred front and white rump, suggest that it is a chanting goshawk but its short, round wings and long tail, size, sexual size dimorphism, demeanour, hunting behaviour and call note are pure accipiter. One would never mistake it for a chanting goshawk whereas in the field it is often mistaken for one of the small grey-plumaged accipiters. So it is neither an accipiter nor a chanting goshawk, but is close to both, and is placed in its own monotypic genus Micronisus (which translates to ‘small sparrowhawk’ from the Latin).</p><p>Gabars are primarily savanna birds but they extend widely into the semi-arid west and into the Karoo wherever trees provide habitat. They much favour acacia thornveld but also occur in mopane and other broad-leafed woodlands, and in most places they are usually encountered singly. Among adults, grey-plumaged birds predominate but, for reasons unexplained, a significant number are melanistic, i.e. entirely black, and the proportion of these varies regionally between 6-20%. Melanistic birds lack most of the features one would use to identify a normal-plumaged adult – the characteristic white rump, for example, is either absent or much reduced – and they could be mistaken for, perhaps, a Black Cuckoo in flight. They do however have the legs and bill of a bird of prey, and the legs and cere are the same bright red colour as in the grey-plumaged bird, so from this the connection to this species is soon made.</p><p>Gabars are primarily savanna birds but they extend widely into the semi-arid west and into the Karoo wherever trees provide habitat.

There are very few other birds of prey that have melanistic morphs and none match the Gabar in the frequency of its occurrence. It is not known whether melanistic birds differ from normal adults in their ability to hunt and catch prey, nor whether they differ in other aspects of their daily life, and it would certainly be an interesting thing to investigate. Finally and unusually, melanistic nestlings become melanistic adults without going through a brown transition plumage as do grey-plumaged Gabars.</p><p>There are other areas in the Gabar’s make-up that provide special interest, and one involves their nesting behaviour. Gabars build a small stick platform nest and they almost invariably incorporate into its walls, pieces of the web nests of one of the Stegodyphus social spiders. These spiders live gregariously in colonies numbering hundreds of individuals in roughly ball-shaped nests that are strung into shrubs or trees, their fringes extended by long, untidy strands that extend in all directions. The spiders that are added by the Gabar to its nest quickly make themselves at home in the new site and expand their web there, eventually festooning the hawk’s nest to the extent that it looks like a single large Stegodyphus nest.</p><p>It has long been speculated on why such a habit has become entrenched in the Gabar Goshawk’s psyche, and making the nest look like a large spider’s web is but one of several explanations. A Stegodyphus nest or its lookalike would have little appeal for a marauding Monitor Lizard, a Slender Mongoose or a Banded Harrier-Hawk, and so there is merit in this camouflage hypothesis. It has also been suggested, though, that the web may trap certain flies that parasitise the nestlings, thus giving the nestlings a better start in life; also that the cobweb may strengthen the Gabar’s rather flimsily constructed nest, and lastly that the spiders may provide a source of in situ food for the nestlings.</p>",

They are absent from the Kalahari and most of Namibia, only being found along the Gariep and Kunene Rivers and their tributaries, and through Namibia’s Zambezi Region.</p><p>The Giant Kingfisher is the largest kingfisher in southern Africa, being nearly five times as heavy as the next largest, the Pied Kingfisher. Indeed, worldwide, the only larger kingfisher is Australia’s Laughing Kookaburra Dacelo novaeguineae.

The dark head is streaked with white, while the very dark grey back is spotted with white.</p><p>The sexes are easily distinguishable because the male has a rufous chest while the female has a black-and-white streaked chest. Some juveniles show rufous from the throat right down to the belly. In flight the underwing of the male is white, and that of the female, rufous. The very large bill can deal with fish up to 200&#160;mm long and is also ideal for catching crabs, which form a large part of the Giant Kingfisher’s diet along many of our rivers. The crabs are carried to a perch, often a rock, where they are bashed to pieces before being consumed.</p><p>They are noisy birds, especially during the breeding season. The loud call is difficult to describe in words, but once heard and identified, it is unlikely to be forgotten. They sit still when hunting and, despite their size, they may be overlooked unless they call.</p><p>These are birds of open rivers, pans and dams, and of temperate seashores in the south of the subregion. Giant Kingfishers hunt from perches, as much as 20 metres above the water, and from which they dive down into the water below. One has to wonder at the force of the impact of the bird dropping from that height. Occasionally, they will fly up and hover briefly before diving into the water below; unlike Pied Kingfishers, they are too heavy to hover for any length of time.</p><p>It is interesting that along the coast they may move out onto rocky areas and hunt for fish in tidal pools, sitting on a rock and diving straight into the pool below. I have even seen one sitting on the beach and flying up to dive onto small mullet in the smooth water behind a breaking wave.</p><p>The nest hole is large, some 150&#160;mm in diameter, built in a large bank, preferably over water. The availability of such nesting banks will often determine the presence of this species along a particular stretch of river. The nest hole is usually 1-2 metres deep, but one was over 8&#160;metres deep. Like all the kingfishers, these birds suffer predation by snakes which come over the top of the bank and slide into the nest to eat the chicks. Sometimes, the snake leaving the nest may merely slip into the water below rather than climb back up onto the top of the bank.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Glossy Ibis is the most widely occurring of the World’s 27 ibis species, occurring across central and eastern North America, southern Europe, Africa and Madagascar and on through the Indomalaysian region to Australia. It is, consequently, a well-known and well researched bird, although its arrival in southern Africa is a relatively recent event and there is still much to be learnt here of its ecology and movements.</p><p>Haagner and Ivy in their 1907 book Sketches of South African Birdlife do not list this ibis as occurring in the region. A few decades later Roberts, in his 1940 edition of The Birds of South Africa, refers to it as being “a rare migrant to South Africa from the northern hemisphere”. Somewhere between then and now things changed and the Glossy Ibis provides an interesting case study of a successful natural colonisation event. Glossy Ibises were first known to breed in southern Africa in 1950 when five pairs nested in a large mixed-species heronry near Springs, and the following summer further searching revealed 11 pairs nesting at the same site; from then on the numbers of these birds nesting in the Witwatersrand heronries increased steadily so that by the summer of 1973/74 there were an estimated 526 pairs nesting at eight different sites on the Witwatersrand. Nowadays it nests widely across southern Africa.</p><p>Haagner and Ivy in their 1907 book Sketches of South African Birdlife do not list this ibis as occurring in the region.

Nowadays it nests widely across southern Africa.</p><p>From this it seems likely that the pioneers of this now-thriving breeding population were the “rare migrants from the northern hemisphere” alluded to by Roberts; birds which did not do the return trip but instead settled. Glossy Ibises are now well-established breeding residents across many parts of southern Africa and their colonisation of the region, although relatively recent, matches that which probably occurred with the Black Stork, Booted Eagle, European Bee-eater, and probably several others of Palaearctic origin. A recovery of a nestling ringed on the Witwatersrand and subsequently found in Zambia indicates that the species’ mobility hasn’t changed.</p><p>Glossy Ibises are easily distinguished from other ibises by their slender build. They have comparatively long thin legs, necks and bills. Their plumage is very variable, this being partly age-related and partly dependent on breeding condition. There are times, at the onset of breeding, when the bird’s head, neck and much of the body is a warm metallic bronze colour and the back, wings and tail are shades of iridescent purple, olive and green. By contrast, non-breeding birds may lose the bronze colouring entirely and appear dull brown, with rather shaggy, speckled heads and necks. During in-between times, birds may have in-between plumages.</p><p>The birds are much restricted to wetlands and favour foraging in the shallows or exposed mud areas of lakes, pans, ponds, floodplains and the like, and they are typically found in groups of a few to a few dozen birds walking in shallow water, often in closed ranks, probing the water or mud ahead of them for aquatic life. When commuting between foraging areas or moving to and from roost sites, they commonly fly in formation, either in a V, or in a long, straggly line, one bird behind the other. Their long slender bodies, necks and legs fully outstretched, and flapping and gliding flight, are characteristic features.</p><p>Breeding takes place in summer and the number nesting annually on the Witwatersrand is rather variable, this probably being dependent on rainfall and availability of foraging areas in wetlands. All nesting here has been in reed beds and in association with other communally nesting herons, egrets, and cormorants. In the Okavango the birds nest in flooded trees, so their use of reed beds for this is not universal. They are monogamous and the pair share parental duties, both building the nest, incubating, and brooding and feeding the young.</p>",

The birds have a striped head with a conspicuous white stripe above and below the eye, separated by three black lines. There is a line of white along the top of the head as well. The black and white contrast is more marked on this species than any other bunting. The back is a russet colour, which contrasts with the black-and-white head. The rump is dark grey while the tail is sooty brown with obvious white edges to the outermost tail feathers.</p><p>This species has a very wide distribution in Africa south of the Sahara, and occurs over much of southern Africa, apart from the very dry west of South Africa and southern Namibia, and from the Fynbos region of the south-western Cape where the Cape Bunting is common. It would appear to need water because these birds come to drink daily at wells and water holes in the Kalahari.

The typical call associated with this species is a rather nasal ‘sip-sip-zhrreed’. They also have a rather more pleasant song which is a whistled ‘weechee-weechee-weechee-weechee-weechee-weechee’ or ‘toodletwee–’. This is usually given from a conspicuous perch and enables one to locate the bird.</p><p>The birds do most of their feeding on the ground, walking about with a slightly rolling gait. They have been recorded as feeding on grass seeds and insects, including grasshoppers, beetles, termites and ants. It was noticeable that the adults brought to their chicks a lot of grasshoppers from which the long back legs had been pulled off. They have also been recorded as feeding on flower buds, although this seems an unusual food source. However, I have noticed that canaries feed on yellow flowers, and it has been suggested that the flowers are a source of carotenes which help the birds to maintain their yellow colour. Perhaps these buntings also need carotenes for their golden plumage.</p><p>The birds breed in spring and summer, building rather thin, flimsy-looking nests of fine plant material. However, the nest is held together with spider web and certainly the nests in our garden withstood heavy storms in summer. The top of the nest, in particular, was often well covered with spider web. Nests in areas where cattle are part of the farming activity usually have a lot of long tail hairs from cattle. This hair comes out when the cow swishes its tail onto a barbed wire fence – the hair getting caught on the barbs. The buntings work their way along the fence collecting the hair for nest lining!</p><p>The birds lay some of the most beautiful eggs of any bird species. They are usually white or pale blue, coloured with hieroglyphics of black and sepia lines around the thick end. The eggs take about 13 days to hatch and the chicks remain in the nest for about 15 to 17 days. This species has been recorded as being parasitised by the Dideric Cuckoo.</p>",

The male and female differ in that the male has a full red crown and nape, whereas the female has a black forehead speckled with white, and the red colour is confined to the rear crown and down the back of the head. The male also has a red malar stripe running back from the base of the bill, whereas the female has a black speckled malar stripe.</p><p>These birds are found over much of southern Africa apart from the Karoo and the Eastern and Western Cape. In the Northern Cape, they are confined to well-wooded areas along the Orange River. North of our region they extend to Sudan and west to Senegal. They are found in any well-developed woodland from the miombo woodlands of central Africa through the mopane and baikiaea woodlands and the various riparian woodlands which occur in areas of grassland. They are usually fairly common where they occur, and in my experience in Zimbabwe’s miombo woodlands they can be very common indeed, given the combination of plentiful food and dead wood for nest-building. There needs to be enough dead wood on the trees from which they can glean the insects that they eat, and where they can peck open and extract grubs in the wood, but where all the dead wood is collected for fuel, this species may be absent.</p><p>These birds are found over much of southern Africa apart from the Karoo and the Eastern and Western Cape.

They are known to pick up ants off the surface of the tree and to eat moth caterpillars, particularly those of the mopane moth. Unlike several other woodland woodpeckers, the males seldom advertise their territory by drumming. They are far more likely to be detected by their distinctive, wailing ‘weeeeeeaa’ call, which is given sporadically, or by the gentle tapping sound they make while foraging.</p><p>They remain in pairs and defend territories year-round. The pair selects a suitable dead branch, usually a sloping branch, in which they can excavate their nest hole. The nest is then excavated on the underside of the branch so that rain water running down will not enter the nest, and because the nest hole is more than 50 mm in diameter, the branch needs to be more than 120 mm in diameter. Construction starts towards the end of winter and is only completed in August or September, when their insect prey becomes more plentiful. Although I have seen a pair use the same nest twice, they usually excavate a new nest each year. This may be partly because their nests are much sought after by other hole-nesting species such as the Black and Miombo Grey Tits.</p><p>The 2-3 eggs laid are plain white and almost round. Newly-hatched chicks are naked and blind, the eyes opening after eight days. Both the male and female feed the chicks, and their work is cut out for them to collect enough food for the chicks as they grow and their demand for food increases. When the chicks are bigger, they come to the nest hole to be fed. After fledging, the chicks only remain in the natal territory for a few weeks before dispersing. This is one of the host species parasitised by the Lesser Honeyguide, and as a result the woodpeckers are very aggressive towards honeyguides, chasing them whenever they appear around the nest.</p>",

Twitchers pursue this species with near-feverish zeal for manifold reasons: it is nomadic, unpredictable and elusive and has been recorded on less than a dozen occasions in the region. It occupies a monotypic genus due to its many unique characteristic including, bizarrely for a passerine, unfeathered thighs. Most memorably, males are ludicrously bright yellow, making them the world’s most handsome pipit. This explains why most records are of males and suggests that females are overlooked.</p><p>The species was first recorded in southern Africa when a pair was collected in Irene, Gauteng in 1906. It was next spotted in Hwange, Zimbabwe in 1972. The next record was from Rust de Winter, north of Pretoria, in 1986. As all subsequent records were of short-staying individuals, birders who dipped on the Rust de Winter bird had to wait 24 years for another viable opportunity.</p><p>The species was first recorded in southern Africa when a pair was collected in Irene, Gauteng in 1906.

Fortunately, the bird remained for nearly a month, during which time hundreds made the pilgrimage to watch its parachuting display flight and gasp at its spectacular yellow wings as it chased any other passing yellow bird.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Large herons – and this species is the world’s largest – are dependent for their survival on large, permanent wetlands and/or perennial rivers that support good fish stocks. The Goliath Heron is no exception, and it occurs sparsely across southern Africa where these conditions are met; it follows the course of the Vaal and then the Orange Rivers, all the way to the sea and does the same along the Zambezi and Kunene rivers. It also occurs widely throughout the vast Okavango and Caprivi wetlands while coastal estuaries, lakes and lagoons also form part of its beat. Another area where the birds are routinely encountered is along the larger rivers traversing the Kruger National Park. Further afield its range extends across sub-Saharan Africa and across the Middle East into the Indian subcontinent.</p><p>Goliath Herons are impressively large birds with fearsome-looking dagger-like bills. They stand 1.4-1.5 metres tall and have a wingspan of 2-2.3 metres – that is up there with the largest raptors in the region. Unlike raptors, they are not given to soaring flight, but instead fly with ponderous wing beats, 98 flaps per minute, head retracted and held close to the body heron-style, and legs extending well beyond the tail. The ornate breeding plumes and facial colour changes associated with many other herons during breeding do not happen in this species, and the sexes are alike.</p><p>Goliath Herons are impressively large birds with fearsome-looking dagger-like bills.

The ornate breeding plumes and facial colour changes associated with many other herons during breeding do not happen in this species, and the sexes are alike.</p><p>Open water is their favoured hunting terrain and their long legs enable them to wade into deeper water than the shorter-legged Grey Heron and other herons that favour foraging in similar habitat. Watching a Goliath Heron is a bit like watching continental drift at work; this heron has an unparalleled capacity for standing rooted to one spot while fishing, and in a study conducted years ago at Lake St Lucia it was demonstrated that these birds spend, on average, about half the daylight hours fishing, with three-quarters of this time standing motionless in one position. At intervals, once or twice an hour, the bird may move position to another site and, on average, successful strikes at passing fish occurred only 2-3 times per day. Goliath Herons prey primarily on fish, and they are capable of catching and swallowing items up to about 40 cm in length. Some that are caught are simply too large to swallow, though, and these are discarded. And a proportion of the fish caught are lost from mishandling or they are pirated by African Fish Eagles.</p><p>One seldom encounters Goliath Herons other than singly, and even in ideal conditions foraging birds are usually spaced a kilometre or more apart. The exception to this solitary lifestyle occurs during breeding when single pairs may join mixed-species heronries, or two or more pairs may nest in close proximity to one another in a monospecific colony, either in a tree or bushclump standing in water, in an extensive reed bed, or on a small island – seven active nests on an island just 50 m wide is the densest nesting colony on record. Nesting can occur at any time of the year but it is much tied to rainfall and periods of flooding and high water levels. The nesting cycle is much like that reported for other herons: both sexes build the nest, and share in the incubation of the eggs and care of the nestlings. Given the large size of the bird, it is unexpected that both the incubation (24-30 days) and the nestling (40 days) periods are little different from that recorded in the other larger herons found in the region.</p>",

It was common in appropriate bush habitat around Durban, and its unique call always gave notice of its presence, but its fondness for lurking in the densest thickets of Lantana or other tangled undergrowth frustrated attempts to view it satisfactorily.</p><p>The Gorgeous Bush-Shrike is well named; the blood-red throat and upper breast of the male never fails to impress, perhaps because it is so rarely seen (the red forehead, face and breast of the Black-collared Barbet is equally colourful but does not get us gasping with admiration when viewed on a daily basis). This bush-shrike is doubly attractive, being not only beautiful to look at, but also good to hear. Its loud, whistled ‘kong-kong-koit’ is a cheerful call.</p><p>The Gorgeous Bush-Shrike is well named; the blood-red throat and upper breast of the male never fails to impress, perhaps because it is so rarely seen (the red forehead, face and breast of the Black-collared Barbet is equally colourful but does not get us gasping with admiration when viewed on a daily basis). This bush-shrike is doubly attractive, being not only beautiful to look at, but also good to hear. Its loud, whistled ‘kong-kong-koit’ is a cheerful call.</p><p>This call varies from place to place, and both or either the ‘kong’ or ‘koit’ (pronounced ‘koyt’, not ‘ko-it’)may be uttered twice. The Woodward brothers, who knew the bird as the Natal Bush Shrike, lived in the age when collecting birds was the norm, and they further commented: “It is particularly partial to dense thickets where, if it is disturbed, it makes a croaking noise, and it is difficult to shoot it at such close quarters without destroying the plumage.”</p><p>Fortunately the camera has replaced the gun, and taking a good photograph of a bird can be far more challenging than shooting it. My own schoolboy interest in bird photography brought about my best viewing of the Gorgeous Bush-Shrike. I often spent weekends birding at Shongweni Dam, inland from Durban. One December, the manager at the dam mentioned he had found the nest of a Gorgeous Bush-Shrike, and he gave me directions on where to find it. A track had been cleared alongside the upper reaches of the dam, and the shrike had evidently built a nest about a metre above the ground in a shrub over which some cleared thorny branches had been thrown. I located the nest in the late afternoon; it contained two warm eggs. Next morning I set off, lugging tripod and heavy ancient plate camera, and set it all up in a hastily constructed hide of cleared branches a few metres from the nest.</p><p>The female soon returned and settled on the nest, but she was uneasy about the new feature in her field of view from the nest, and she left and returned to the nest a few times. Then there was some ‘croaking’ and the male arrived. The female left, via the thickest cover available, and the male settled down on the nest. I could not believe my luck, but wished I had some colour film (not available in those days). The male was far less concerned about the ‘hide’ than the female had been, and I did not realise that I was witnessing something that would remain unknown (or at least unpublished) for the next few decades, namely that incubation is shared between both sexes of the Gorgeous Bush-Shrike. It was a hot day; the nest was in deep shadow with a brightly lit backdrop, and I had no flash. My photos revealed mere black silhouettes, but at least I’d had some splendid views of these normally difficult-to-see birds.</p><p>Because of their love of dense tangles of vegetation, not a great deal is known about Gorgeous Bush-Shrikes’ diet, roosting or courtship behaviour. They are territorial and usually resident in their chosen area, unless they occupy largely deciduous thickets, which are necessarily vacated when leaf fall reduces cover. They feed mostly on the ground.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Gray’s Larks occupy the barren gravel plains of the Namib Desert, with or without sparse grass or low shrubs, from the coast inland to the fringes of the escarpment. They occur from the Sperregebiet south of Lüderitz, Namibia, north to Pico do Azevedo in southern Angola. They are absent from the sand desert and coastal dunes, and are most frequently seen where there is sparse, very low vegetation.</p><p>Throughout the year, Gray’s Larks are usually in pairs, groups, or rather loose flocks. The groups can be dynamic, with individuals wandering off to join other groups. Gray’s Larks have a range of behavioural and metabolic defences against the heat and aridity. On hot days, they may shelter from the heat in rodent burrows, or dissipate body heat by exposing their thinly feathered underwings and sides while perched on stones or shrubs, facing into the wind. They rarely drink, relying on their food as the source of water. They seldom fly far if flushed, tending rather to crouch when alarmed.</p><p>Throughout the year, Gray’s Larks are usually in pairs, groups, or rather loose flocks.

They rarely drink, relying on their food as the source of water. They seldom fly far if flushed, tending rather to crouch when alarmed.</p><p>Gray’s Larks forage throughout the day, but take respites around midday, in order to reduce their heat loads. The birds walk about, pecking food from the ground or around antelope droppings, and regularly jump up to snatch food from shrubs. Food items just below the soil surface are exposed by flicking sand or gravel sideways with the bill, leaving a distinctive raked pattern. The diet of Gray’s Lark varies with rainfall, but averages about 50% seeds and other vegetable matter, and 50% invertebrates, including termites, ants, beetles, locusts, spiders and solifugids.</p><p>Anyone who has camped on the gravel plains of the Namib Desert when there has been rain will have heard the nocturnal and dawn song of Gray’s Lark. This very distinctive song comprises a very high-pitched series of tinkling notes and loud, upslurred whistles at night, with song phrases interspersed with bursts of reedy wing-whirring given in the predawn aerial display. Males perform undulating display flights about 30 minutes after sunset and for about two hours before dawn. These are accompanied by song and wing-whirring. Pair bonds in Gray’s Lark appear to be ephemeral, and the post-sunset night song and predawn displays – which take place within groups of larks – are all linked to courtship and pairing. Once paired, couples leave the group to nest but may rejoin their original group, or move to another group after breeding.</p><p>Gray’s Lark is usually monogamous, but records suggest that very occasionally they may breed co-operatively, with at least one helper at the nest. Nests are usually solitary, sometimes in loose and scattered groups. The birds dig a hole in the gravel for the nest, often next to one or two large stones or a grass tuft or shrub, sometimes out in the open. They then line this excavation with a layer of small, round pebbles, and then build a thick-walled cup of soft, fine grass inflorescences with the top of the nest cup flush with, or slightly above, the surrounding gravel. The incubating bird sits low in the nest and is well camouflaged, with its back flush with the ground. Both sexes feed the nestlings. Small nestlings are fed exclusively on small locust nymphs, spiders, beetle larvae and flies. Nestlings leave the nest before they are able to fly and, together with their parents and still dependent on them for food, join small foraging flocks.</p>",

Birds, which at one moment look glossy blue-green, turn, and become a rather dull blackish colour. This species has dark blue ear coverts which contrast more with the blue-green of the rest of the head. However, these ear coverts do not stand out unless the light is striking the bird at the right angle! The underparts of the Blue-eared Starling are somewhat more purple than the upperparts, and this facilitates identification. The row of black spots on the wing coverts is well defined in this species. However, the best aid for identifying this bird is the single-note call which it adds to its song every now and again. This single note is a rather nasal ‘squeeeer’. It is loud and conspicuous and often draws attention to the bird, whose call is otherwise simply a series of whistled notes.</p><p>This starling occurs both in pairs and small groups or, occasionally, in groups of hundreds. In Zimbabwe it occurs in practically all the woodlands, both the well-developed, closed-canopy brachystegia woodlands, and the more open savanna woodlands of the south and west. In the tall woodlands on the plateau the bird is more likely to be encountered in pairs or in small groups. Here they will also join the flocks of Miombo Blue-eared Starling which are a conspicuous part of the winter avifauna. Outside the breeding season, in the more open country to the west, the bird is more likely to be encountered in larger flocks, and flocks of several hundred can be seen in areas where food, such as grasshoppers, is abundant.</p><p>This starling occurs both in pairs and small groups or, occasionally, in groups of hundreds.

They regularly attend hatches of termite alates, flying up from the ground to hawk the airborne alates, then dropping to the ground to eat them; usually knocking off the wings before swallowing the body. When the wild figs are in fruit this species visits fig trees, especially those with small fruits (such as Ficus natalensis), the birds foraging mainly on the ground for fallen fruit. I found them to be regular visitors to the Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala when these were in flower. These flowers produce so much nectar that it drips onto the ground below. The starlings move from flower to flower, sipping the copious nectar. They also sipped nectar from the Kenya Coffee Shade Tree Acrocarpus fraxinifolius in our garden.</p><p>The Greater Blue-eared Starling requires a fairly large hole in which to nest. Most of our woodpeckers and barbets do not excavate holes large enough for this species.   They readily took over the nest holes of the Bearded Woodpecker and, to a lesser extent, the nest holes of the Crested and Black-collared Barbets in the Marondera area. However, they also made extensive use of larger natural holes which occurred in the brachystegia trees and which provided sufficient space for them to build a nest in the bottom of the hole. One pair of birds at Peterhouse built a nest in a partially built wall of cement blocks which had holes about 200&#160;mm in diameter going down into the wall. They are recorded as being parasitised by the Great Spotted Cuckoo, but I have to wonder how a bird the size of the Great Spotted Cuckoo could get into the nest holes utilised by this starling!</p>",

There is also an extension towards the north-west of scattered records through to the northern Free State. The highest densities probably occur in the Eastern and southern Cape. A small isolated population occurring on Mount Gorongosa in Mozambique has been ascribed to this species but is increasingly being given full species status as the Gorongosa Double-banded Sunbird Cinnyris amicorum. A few records, reputedly of this species, have been noted from the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, but no birds have yet been collected or caught during ringing studies.</p><p>There is a complex relationship between this species and the smaller Southern Double-collared Sunbird. It has been suggested that the Greater excludes the smaller bird in habitats where the two occur together, for instance in the forested areas to the west of Knysna, but that the Southern replaces the Greater and inhabits a greater range of habitats eastwards of about Knysna. In the George area it is only an occasional visitor to forested areas when suitable nectar sources are available. There are obviously some finer ecological factors at play here requiring a very detailed study, especially in the southern Cape region. In the Eastern Cape the Southern Double-banded is more of a species of valley forest and bushveld, overlapping with the Greater in the latter habitat. The two may nest close together with limited or no interaction and certainly feed alongside each other at winter nectar sources and bird feeders close to forested and bushed habitat; away from these habitats in more open country, only the larger bird may normally be found at these nectar sources.</p><p>There is a complex relationship between this species and the smaller Southern Double-collared Sunbird.

It has been suggested, from a study made in the Grahamstown area, that there may be altitudinal movement to richer nectar sources at lower levels during the winter months. However, in another study a little further south and at a lower altitude, there was a considerable influx into the area from February to April, especially March, coinciding with the main flowering of Wild Dagga Leonotis leonura, with very much fewer birds during the winter months, and another smaller influx from mid-July to September, mainly August, which coincided with the flowering of a variety of other plants. All of these plants showed some flowering in-between these periods, yet the numbers of birds reached a minimum in June. This gave the impression that this site was a transitory site between winter and summer quarters. The males go into a partial, if not complete, eclipse plumage for a short period in the summer, making them much less conspicuous, but trapping showed few birds were present during this period.</p>",

And yet they somehow manage to pull it off. Indeed they are spectacular when massed in large flocks, especially prior to breeding when they perform their curious displays.</p><p>The Greater Flamingo is the larger of Africa’s two flamingos. Adults have white body plumage, appearing paler at rest than adult Lesser Flamingos, but in flight their black and crimson wings are more striking. Young birds of both species are grey-brown, so the best way to differentiate them is on bill pattern: Greater Flamingos have a pale bill with a black tip, whereas the bill of the Lesser Flamingo appears dark from a distance.

It takes the youngsters several years to acquire adult plumage.</p><p>The flamingo’s peculiar bill is adapted to filter feed. The muscular tongue pumps water through sieve-like lamellae that line the inside of the bill, capturing food items. The lamellae on the bill of the Greater Flamingo are widely spaced, letting them feed on quite large prey, so they occur at a wider range of wetlands than the Lesser Flamingo. They usually filter water at or close to the bottom, kicking their long legs to keep their heads at the bottom when feeding in deeper water. In shallow water, they use their feet to help stir up bottom sediments, frequently walking in circles around the feeding site. This creates distinctive tyre-shaped depressions in the sand that are exposed at low tide.</p><p>Greater Flamingos occur year round at many wetlands, but only breed at a few sites. In southern Africa, breeding occurs most often at Etosha Pan, Namibia, and Sua Pan, Botswana. However, even here breeding is sporadic, when water levels are just right. If the pans dry up too quickly, any chicks not yet able to fly are doomed to starvation. They sometimes try to breed at other sites, but seldom succeed. Breeding occurs in large flocks, probably at least in part to swamp local predators, with up to 40 000 pairs at Sua Pan and 27 000 pairs at Etosha in good years. Prior to breeding, they perform mass displays: head-flagging, where hundreds simultaneously turn their heads from side to side while walking with erect necks, and wing-saluting, where the wings are rapidly extended and retracted, providing a stunning flash of crimson and black.</p><p>Given their irregular breeding habits, Greater Flamingos rely on their longevity to persist; some wild birds reach at least 40 years old. Their populations thus are sensitive to additional mortality, such as that caused by colliding with powerlines. However, they are most vulnerable to the destruction or degradation of wetlands, and disturbance at their breeding sites. Despite successes in Europe, attempts to enhance the southern African population by creating breeding islands at saltpans have largely failed, and so the population remains dependent on episodic breeding attempts at the large, inland pans.</p><p>Estimating the population size is complicated by their great mobility. Flamingos move between wetlands at night, covering hundreds of kilometres, and in this way thousands of birds can appear at isolated pans literally overnight. Walvis Bay is the single most important non-breeding site in the region, supporting up to 44 000 birds in winter and 28 000 in summer. Although not considered globally threatened, counts suggest that the African population has decreased by 40-50% in recent decades, contrasting with increases in the European population.</p>",

They have extremely low wing loadings and are unique among seabirds in lacking any waterproofing on their plumage. They virtually never land on the sea, taking all their prey from the air Renowned for stealing food from other birds, they use their superior aerial prowess to chase and harry them into regurgitating their prey. This is done more by the larger females. Males catch most of their food themselves, scooping fish and squid from the water surface, often relying on tunas or dolphins to drive their prey to the surface.</p><p>Identification of frigatebirds is complicated by age- and sex-related plumage differences. The Greater Frigatebird is the more common species in southern Africa. It is only slightly larger than the Lesser Frigatebird; correct identification requires knowing the sex and age of the bird, but it is only regularly encountered in the Mozambique Channel, where around 1 000 pairs breed on Europa Island.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Being shown a wild beehive in the African bushveld by a Greater Honeyguide must surely be one of the most thrilling and extraordinary nature experiences. While most wild animals shun humankind, here is one confiding creature which actively seeks out our company. The bird’s incessant, rattling, guiding call has a tone and urgency that transcends the language barrier. It also signals its intentions clearly by making short forays in the direction of the hive, leaving even the most sceptical or dim-witted human in no doubt as to what it is saying: “Follow me!” Although the honeyguide is relatively small and somewhat nondescript, the white outer tail feathers are conspicuous as the bird flits noisily ahead. And when it reaches the tree with the beehive, it changes its call, as if to say: “Here it is, right here in this tree.”</p><p>The Honeyguide perches patiently nearby while the bees are being subdued with smoke and the honey extracted, waiting for its share of the spoils – a piece of honeycomb replete with bee grubs. The honeyguide eats the beeswax too, as it is one of the few animals that can actually digest wax. This fact was apparently discovered years ago by an Augustinian monk who observed a honeyguide regularly eating the wax from the candles in his church.</p><p>The Honeyguide perches patiently nearby while the bees are being subdued with smoke and the honey extracted, waiting for its share of the spoils – a piece of honeycomb replete with bee grubs. The honeyguide eats the beeswax too, as it is one of the few animals that can actually digest wax. This fact was apparently discovered years ago by an Augustinian monk who observed a honeyguide regularly eating the wax from the candles in his church.</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine how this mutually beneficial or symbiotic relationship between bird and human came about, given the fact that it is advantageous to both parties. In areas where there are many honey-hunters, such as Matabeleland in Zimbabwe, guiding is a very common occurrence, and the behaviour is regularly reinforced. The opposite may have occurred with the honeyguide and the Honey Badger – in areas where the badger has been persecuted and has become nocturnal, the behaviour has been lost. Or this may simply be apocryphal – it has never been substantiated and there are no recent authentic records of honeyguides leading badgers to beehives.</p><p>From the above account, it is little wonder that people generally have a soft spot for the honeyguide. No one feels that they have been ‘used’ by the bird, although in reality, it is not doing anyone any favours. It has learnt a technique for engaging the services of a fellow creature to enhance its survival. A similar strategy is followed by the breeding honeyguide, although with a less equitable distribution of benefits; Greater Honeyguides are brood parasites.</p><p>During spring, the male honeyguide’s monotonous ‘vic-terr’ territorial call is given from a favoured calling post, where year after year he advertises his readiness to commence breeding. The female, by this time, knows where all the suitable nesting holes are, and which are occupied by a variety of potential hosts (preferentially African Hoopoe, barbets, bee-eaters, kingfishers and starlings). Like a cuckoo, she furtively enters one of these nests and deposits a single egg – this egg does not match closely those of the host, but in the darkness of the nest hole this is probably unimportant. The eggs have relatively thick shells, to reduce the risk of them breaking during the female’s often speedy retreat. The unfortunate hosts are often all too aware of the threat posed by the honeyguides, chasing them vigorously whenever they approach a nest. If she has time, the female may puncture some or all of the host’s eggs to ensure that they do not hatch. The young honeyguide may be further advantaged by starting to develop in the egg even before it is laid, thus hatching in advance of its foster siblings. It is born with a sharply hooked beak which it uses to assassinate all competition.</p><p>Thus the Greater Honeyguide’s lifestyle is characterised by the adept use of other creatures, us included, enhancing its survival.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>As its name suggests, the Greater Kestrel is a little larger than other kestrels in the region. It is also more uniformly coloured, much less sexually dimorphic, more generalised in its build and biology, and less specific in its habitat requirements than most other members of this group. While it does occur patchily through east Africa and even into Ethiopia and Somalia, it is mainly a southern African bird, favouring the dry grasslands, rangelands and open savannas of the Kalahari and the Karoo. Because of its strangely ‘undifferentiated’ appearance it can be a bit slippery in the field, and quite easily confused with Rock Kestrel Falco rupicolus, and even Lanner Falcon F. biarmicus, at a distance and under certain conditions, despite the fact that these other species have numerous field characters that should make them easily distinguishable. A useful guide for Greater Kestrel is the general lack of distinguishing features, except perhaps a pale overall appearance (particularly from below), noticeably large, rounded head, somewhat broad, rounded wings for a falcon, and quite slow, buoyant flight, which is almost gull-like at times. The white eye of the adult is also a key diagnostic feature if visible.</p><p>In many of the drier parts of its current distribution, where trees are relatively scarce, the Greater Kestrel is all but totally dependent on man-made structures (telephone poles, power poles and pylons, wind pumps) as hunting and roosting perches. This dependent nature extends even further in its requirement for other birds (mainly crows) to build stick nests on these structures in order to provide suitable locations for the kestrels to nest. It’s not clear how Greater Kestrels, or Pied Crows Corvus albus or Cape Crows C. capensis for that matter, were able to occupy the tree-less tracts of the Karoo in which they presently occur in abundance, before the construction of utility networks. In fact all three species are surely much more numerous in these areas than they were historically, and may even be recent colonists of habitats that were completely unavailable to them as recently as 100 years ago. Given that they are so beholden to corvids for all these new nesting opportunities, Greater Kestrels are suitably tolerant of crows, and the kestrel and crow pairs will even breed in the same power pylon, only 10-15 m apart, without too much interaction. However, there’s no mistaking the tension that still exists between these close neighbours, particularly because the crows are potential predators of kestrel eggs and small chicks. Eggs are usually laid in spring, but the timing of breeding is variable and closely tied to rainfall.</p><p>In many of the drier parts of its current distribution, where trees are relatively scarce, the Greater Kestrel is all but totally dependent on man-made structures (telephone poles, power poles and pylons, wind pumps) as hunting and roosting perches.

They are lazy, low-velocity hunters of reptiles and arthropods wherever they can get away with this sedate approach, but can hover with a bit of wind to hold them up, and can turn on the afterburners and chase down small birds if and when required. Overall, this is a falcon with an identity crisis – a bit big and clumsy for a kestrel, and a little light in the pants and short on energy to compete seriously with the big boys. But it does have unique, endearing and enduring qualities, and the sight of a pair of Greater Kestrels, displaying elegantly together over ‘their’ nest on a transmission pylon in the clear, glowing light of a Karoo dawn is strangely (and ironically) redolent of that heartland.</p>",

Due to its skulking and crepuscular habits and erratic occurrence at any one locality, few people have seen more than just the occasional birds. As a result it is poorly studied in our area other than a ringing study spread over many years in Zimbabwe and Zambia, and some observations of breeding behaviour from the Cape Town area. This aberrant wader, which is more closely related to the jacanas than to the true snipes, has a very patchy sub-Saharan distribution, avoiding forested, mountainous and arid regions. Elsewhere it is found on the lower Nile River, and from Pakistan across to Japan. Painted-snipes also occur in Australia: this bird has recently been separated as a distinct species despite its very similar appearance to our bird.</p><p>Within southern Africa there are two populations, with the rapidly dwindling population of the south-western Cape apparently being isolated from the bulk of the species’ regional range and probably moving only locally. This small population has been seriously impacted by the direct and indirect effects of urbanisation. The species’ occurrence eastwards along the coast to the Eastern Cape is erratic, with birds tending to be present after years of high winter rainfall. It is not known if these birds have spread out from the south-west or if they come from further north.</p><p>Within southern Africa there are two populations, with the rapidly dwindling population of the south-western Cape apparently being isolated from the bulk of the species’ regional range and probably moving only locally.

It is not known if these birds have spread out from the south-west or if they come from further north.</p><p>Elsewhere, the occurrence and movements of painted-snipes are subject to the vicissitudes of the regional rainfall. There is a general range expansion during wetter periods. Overall, there appears to be an east-west movement in the south of our area and a south-north movement further north. It seems that there is substantial movement into and out of the region, but the extent of these movements is unknown, and there have been no substantiating ring recoveries.</p><p>These birds have well-defined ecological requirements which ensure their continu&#173;ous nomadic behaviour, favouring marshy areas with receding water leaving a mixture of exposed wet mud and emergent vegetation. Once the water recedes from the vegetation and the mud starts drying birds quickly move on, but if the right conditions prevail, birds may remain for a few months.</p><p>Breeding has been recorded in all months except May and June. In Zimbabwe, following normal or high rainfall in the lower rainfall areas (250-500&#160;mm/year), egg-laying takes place from January to early April. In the higher rainfall areas (&gt;750&#160;mm/year) egg-laying occurs from August to October. There is a more erratic pattern of egg-laying in the intermediate-rainfall areas that is determined by the individual season’s rain. It has been suggested that most southern visitors, for instance to the Eastern Cape, are non-breeding birds – but breeding can be very easily overlooked. However, the more southerly birds probably are opportunistic breeders and may never visit the same locality in successive years. Indeed, ringing studies have yet to show birds returning to the area of ringing in succeeding seasons. Individually, their breeding ranges probably encompass a large portion of southern and central Africa.</p><p>Most literature indicates that females have two to four male partners per breeding season (a breeding system termed polyandry, in which the multiple male partners are responsible for most or all of the incubation and all care for the young). However, ringing and museum sp ecimen studies in Zimbabwe have shown that 57% of all birds handled were male and 43% female, hardly the heavily skewed sex ratio one might expect in a polyandrous species, although in other areas it is decidedly polyandrous.</p>",

Unlike its sedentary sub-Antarctic cousin, Greater Sheathbills breed farther south in summer, on the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, then migrate north to spend the winter in Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. It is during these movements that some birds land on ships where, thanks to their catholic diet and confiding nature, they are readily adopted by ships’ crews. A few Greater Sheathbills reached the Cape each autumn through the 1990s, but there have been few records since 2000, following a reduction in the number of fishing vessels passing the Cape at the right time of year.

The full extent of its non-breeding area is poorly known, but ring recoveries and observations confirm its dry-season occurrence in central Africa, from northern Angola and Zambia to southern DRC and Tanzania.</p><p>Breeding activity starts soon after spring arrival, and most pairs are able to squeeze in two, if not three, broods in a season. If the previous season’s nest is still intact it will be refurbished; if it has collapsed or been usurped by another species, a new nest will be started. These swallows are quite confiding when utilising one’s house or veranda as a nesting site. Both sexes build, mainly in the morning and late afternoon, collecting mud from the nearest available source to fashion – pellet by pellet – the closed nest chamber and access tunnel. This may take four to seven weeks, depending on the availability of mud. One pair started to build a nest on a rafter of our veranda, collecting their mud from a nearby lei-water canal. After four weeks they had completed the chamber and started to build the entrance tunnel. However, before the tunnel was more than 30 mm long a pair of White-rumped Swifts claimed occupancy, and the swallows went elsewhere, presumably to start all over again.

Swallows are adapted to feed on the wing, gathering minute flying insects such as aphids and midges (collectively termed ‘aerial plankton’), though they will sometimes descend to the ground to collect insects. Their beaks are small and slender, but very wide, appropriate for catching soft insects in flight, but not for eating hard seeds. Yet that is what Greater Striped Swallows do, and they even feed them to their nestlings, especially on windy days when small flying insects are hard to come by! The seeds in question are of the introduced Australian Acacia cyclops, known in South Africa as Rooikransor Red Eye. These seeds are black and very hard, and are encircled by bright red or orange arils. It is these fleshy, oil-rich, and nutritious arils that the swallows seek.</p><p>The habit was first discovered because the seeds were noticed in the droppings (excreted by chicks) beneath a nest. A reference to mulberries in the diet was based on the colour of chicks’ faeces – from the same nest. Subsequent observations revealed that the Greater Striped Swallows pluck and swallow the seeds, which are then separated from the arils in the bird’s muscular stomach and subsequently regurgitated. Lesser Striped Swallows also eat Rooi&#173;krans seeds, and so do the Palaearctic-breeding migrant Barn Swallows – they probably learnt the habit from their African cousins because there are no Rooikrans trees on their breeding grounds on which to practise!</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The largest of the southern African grebes, the Great Crested Grebe, is widely distributed, being found in most of the Old World, including Australia. In Africa it occurs along the Mediterranean coast, but in the remainder of Africa has a primarily eastern distribution – in the East African Rift Valley and southern Africa. It is largely confined to South Africa, with small populations in western Zimbabwe, south-eastern Botswana, the Zambezi Region, north-central and coastal Namibia. Great Crested Grebes are generally resident, but may be nomadic according to environmental conditions, and are able to rapidly colonise suitable waters, sometimes flying long distances to reach seasonally flooded areas.</p><p>The Great Crested Grebe offered me an opportunity to study the same species in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. A lake adjacent to my study site in East Germany was occupied by several pairs of Great Crested Grebes, all identical in appearance to their southern African relatives, so I was able to observe their elaborate ritualised courtship displays, thought to be more complex than the courtship displays in African birds. Courtship rituals in Europe have an initial pairing phase, when antagonism is displayed to conspecifics; no doubt to sort out territorial boundaries. The southern African birds similarly have various territorial ‘Threat displays’ to rivals, with barking and growling calls given in various postures, head lowered and neck stretched out, for example, or ear tippets raised, or neck awash, and/or back feathers may be ruffled and wings raised, and this may be followed by a dive and underwater swim towards adversary. Other named displays in Europe include the ‘Ghostly penguin display’, with body upright, tail and rump submerged, ‘Cat display’, with head lowered, crest erected, wings raised above back, ‘Mutual penguin dance’, in which a pair rises out of the water, face to face, crests raised, breasts sometimes touching. After a nest site has been selected, the pair builds several nest platforms, this followed by a further set of ritualised platform courtship displays.</p><p>The Great Crested Grebe offered me an opportunity to study the same species in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

The territorial defence displays are followed by water courtship displays. Platform courtship follows water courtship when the pair selects a nest site and builds one or two rudimentary platforms of water plants, eventually building an actual nest. Nests are generally solitary. The nest, a platform of water weeds or other plant material, is anchored underwater to water plants. The eggs are usually covered with nest material by the incubating bird when he or she is disturbed from the nest; less often covered when the birds leave the nest to forage. Newly-hatched young are striped longitudinally with brownish black and off-white. Chicks leave the nest immediately after hatching and swim with their parents; up to 14 days old are regularly carried on the parents’ backs, intermittently carried up to 21 days old.</p><p>Great Crested Grebes forage by diving for food; occasionally taking items from the water surface. Food is almost exclusively small fish, but also includes aquatic insects, crustaceans and tadpoles. Foraging dives last about 20-25 seconds; longer if prey is sparse. Great Crested Grebes fishing as a group have been regularly seen at Rondevlei near Muizenberg. The birds form a line and drive the fish towards the bank or along the edge in the shallower water, and are frequently joined by Little Egrets that feed opportunistically on the fish driven into the shallows. Like other grebes, feathers are eaten to wrap fish bones for ease of regurgitation in pellets.</p>",

The Great Egret was the primary source of such feathers, each bird growing 40-50 ‘aigrettes’ in a season, but other white species, including Snowy and Little Egrets, were also exploited. Current usage names this species an ‘egret’ in English but an Ardea (heron) in Latin; similarly the Cattle Egret’s scientific name is not Egretta but Bulbulcus so it should rightfully be called a heron, and the Black Heron, Egretta ardesiaca, should rightfully be called an egret. In short, the names ‘egret’ and ‘heron’ don’t relate to species that develop or don’t develop elongated plumes, neither to whether they have the scientific name Egretta or Ardea.</p><p>The scale of exploitation of breeding egrets for their feathers in the last century almost defies belief, and it is remarkable that some of these species are still with us. Tens, and even hundreds of thousands of birds were slaughtered annually to supply the markets; one London feather trader is documented to have imported, in 1902 alone, 193 000 skins of the Great Egret. The carnage only came to an end a decade later, and this is largely attributed to the establishment of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (in 1898) which was constituted primarily to bring this industry to a halt.</p><p>The scale of exploitation of breeding egrets for their feathers in the last century almost defies belief, and it is remarkable that some of these species are still with us.

Leg, foot and bill colour varies across this wide range. Birds in sub-Saharan Africa belong to the race melanorhynchos, and these have entirely black legs and toes – look at Great Egrets in Europe, and you may be surprised to see they have all-yellow legs. Bill colour is also regionally variable, and in the sub-Saharan birds the bill becomes all-black at the start of breeding but reverts to all-yellow outside the breeding period; in our Great Egrets it is not unusual to see birds year-round with partially black (at the tip) and partially yellow bills. Their lores, grey at other times, change colour briefly to a vivid apple green at the onset of the breeding season.</p><p>As expected with a bird that occurs widely and commonly, the Great Egret’s biology and life history is well known. It is a strictly aquatic-foraging species, preying mainly on fish which it catches in shallow water in a variety of ways, from still-hunting to walking slowly, to rapid pursuit; mostly, birds fish solitarily but during barbel/catfish runs and at other times of temporary fish abundance, these birds gather in numbers at the food source and hunt side by side. Small fish, up to 45 g in size, are most often taken, and the estimated daily food requirement is 236 g, or about 25 fish/day.</p><p>Fish availability and abundance drives the breeding cycle, and in southern Africa breeding occurs rather erratically and variably. When they do breed, it is usually in a large mixed-species heronry, either in a reed bed over water or in partly submerged trees. The ritual associated with securing a mate and establishing a pair bond is quite a spectacle – each partner raises the elongated back plumes, then shakes and lowers them, necks are extended and retracted, and harsh croaking notes emitted. Males gather nesting material and deliver these to the site where the female constructs the large nest platform, and when this is done she lays a clutch of 3-4 eggs. Both parents share the incubation and the brooding, and feeding the nestlings in a nesting cycle takes about 3 months to complete.</p>",

However, genetic evidence suggests that there are two natural groups: the large shearwaters are more closely allied to Calonectris than they are to the small, black-and-white Manx-type shearwaters. The Great Shearwater falls into the former group. It is a large, strikingly patterned shearwater with scaled brown upperparts, a distinctive dark cap and mostly white underparts. Virtually the entire population breeds at the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island in the central South Atlantic Ocean, with a few hundred pairs in the Falklands. It does not breed on the main island of Tristan, probably as a result of human actions, but Nightingale, Inaccessible and Gough Islands collectively support some five million pairs.</p><p>Great Shearwaters are trans-Equatorial migrants, spending the boreal summer in the North Atlantic, with some birds ranging north of the Arctic Circle. Like Cory’s Shearwaters, they follow a figure-of-eight route to minimise exposure to headwinds during their long, arduous migration. After breeding, birds visit the Cape in April-May before heading up the west coast of Africa, across the Equator to the east coast of North America and end their northward journey in the productive waters off Newfoundland and Greenland. They return south off the coast of Europe and west Africa to Senegal, then cut across to Brazil and down the South American coast until they reach around 30-35ºS, when they head east to reach their breeding grounds. In addition to being abundant off the Cape in the austral autumn, they are also common in spring, especially in September-October, when at least some breeding birds visit the Cape during their pre-laying feeding exodus. Breeding birds return to their colonies in mid-September to reclaim their burrows (sometimes evicting Broad-billed Prions) and re-establish pair bonds, then take a few weeks off to build up their reserves before egg laying commences in early November. During summer, most breeding birds forage south and west of Tristan and Gough, but some also visit the Cape, where their numbers are swelled by non-breeding birds. A few birds range into the south-west Indian Ocean, exceptionally as far east as Australia. However, in 2011 hundreds of Great Shearwaters were recorded from Australia: there was no obvious reason for their irruption so far east.</p><p>Great Shearwaters are trans-Equatorial migrants, spending the boreal summer in the North Atlantic, with some birds ranging north of the Arctic Circle.

They feed by surface-seizing and shallow plunging as well as pursuit-diving. Two females that were equipped with dive loggers reached a maximum depth of 19 metres. A larger sample of birds doubtless would reveal a more impressive diving capability, but most of their dives are shallow (less than 2 metres). They do follow ships, but seldom for protracted periods unless food is being dumped Perhaps surprisingly for a pursuit-diving bird, almost all birds contain plastic in their stomachs. Some birds have the entire gizzard stuffed with plastic, to the extent that it spills out into the fore-stomach, reducing the amount of food they can eat. Among breeding birds, those containing lots of plastic are in poorer condition and have higher levels of PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyls), but not other organochlorine pollutants, than birds with little plastic in their stomachs. Great Shearwaters also are killed accidentally on fishing gear, and are killed deliberately by tuna pole fishers when they steal their bait. However, the population is vast and it is not considered to be threatened. Thousands of chicks are harvested for food on Nightingale Island each year with no perceptible impact on that island’s population.</p>",

Although locally common in some areas, in other similar-looking situations the bird is rare or even absent.</p><p>The birds occur in the arid or semi-arid open savanna woodlands, usually, but not always, in association with acacia trees. It is interesting that where acacia is recolonising land that is either being overgrazed or cropped, the Great Sparrow is often one of the first birds to move into the regenerating habitat. This was particularly conspicuous in an area we visited near the Orapa diamond mine in Botswana. Here the birds were in pairs, but on one of the lands we noticed a small flock of Great Sparrows feeding on what appeared to be some type of infestation of worms. It is also interesting to note that the birds may gather in fairly large numbers at selected watering points where the water is provided by man in what is otherwise a dry environment. A visit to the Kalahari National Park in September one year indicated that the Great Sparrows were present in quite considerable numbers judging by the number of birds coming to drink.</p><p>This species is thought to have permanent pair bonding. This would mean that the same pair occupies the same territory until one or other of the pair disappears or dies. The surviving bird would then seek a new mate. Both members of the pair participate in building a large, untidy nest which consists of a ball of grass with a nest chamber in the middle. The nest is placed in a thorny bush or tree, sometimes as low as one metre from ground level, but usually two or three metres above the ground. The birds are to be found in the general area of the nest throughout the year.</p><p>It would appear that, like many species adapted to arid environments, these birds are prompted to breed according to rainfall. Rain in arid regions results in germination of dormant seeds and a rapid flush of plant growth, which attracts insects and generates new seed crops. It is interesting that while the adult Great Sparrows feed mainly on seeds, they feed the chicks entirely on insects. Clearly, the more nutritious insects are beneficial for the rapid growth of the chicks. The eggs take about two weeks to hatch and the nestlings remain in the nest for two and a half to three weeks before fledging and moving out into the surrounding country.</p>",

Unlike the New World cuckoos, females of all Old World cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species for rearing. However, it can take different forms, and the Great Spotted Cuckoo has perfected its own particular, workable model which is as bizarre as any. Like most cuckoos, this species arrives in southern Africa in spring. However, not all individuals come here to breed – there are two distinct subspecies, one of which is a non-breeding visitor from its breeding grounds in northern Africa. Apart from this behavioural difference, the two are physically indistinguishable in the field. Those which do breed here seek out the active nests of crows and starlings in which to lay their eggs, showing a preference for those of Pied Crows, followed by Cape Crows and Pied Starlings. Both crows are much larger than the cuckoo, and this is why the Great Spotted Cuckoo differs from most other members of its family in this region by having its chick raised together with those of its host; Levaillant’s Cuckoo is the only other southern African species in which this arrangement occurs regularly.</p><p>Given the marked contrast between the cuckoo chick and those of the host, it is puzzling that the foster parents cannot discriminate the parasite from their own chicks. This conundrum has puzzled biologists (and philosophers) ever since Aristotle first pondered cuckoos in ancient Greece. The most plausible hypothesis relates to the risk of the hosts rejecting their own offspring – the selection pressure associated with this happening is so great that it prevents the evolution of rejection behaviour. Hosts apparently learn what their eggs and young should look like during their first breeding attempt. Since cuckoos usually wait until the host has started laying before parasitizing a nest, the host is able to ‘imprint’ on its own egg pattern – this enables it to distinguish foreign eggs from its own and, in the case of a host which is a ‘discriminator’, to reject cuckoo eggs in the future. However, due to the relatively short incubation period of cuckoo eggs, the first chick to hatch is typically the cuckoo, and the first-time parents will accept it as the ‘norm’. This theory explains the situation where a single cuckoo chick is raised by foster parents (having dispatched all competition), but in the case of the Great Spotted Cuckoo, the host’s own, very different-looking young soon join the intruder in the nest.</p><p>Given the marked contrast between the cuckoo chick and those of the host, it is puzzling that the foster parents cannot discriminate the parasite from their own chicks.

When a hole-nesting starling is the host, the cuckoo chick may monopolise the nest entrance, causing the host’s young to be trampled or starved. The Great Spotted Cuckoo also differs from other southern African cuckoos (except for the closely related Levaillant’s) in that it commonly lays more than one egg per host nest (up to four have been recorded, although there may be multiple female cuckoos involved), and no host eggs are removed. The result is that more than one cuckoo chick may be reared in one nest. So the Great Spotted Cuckoo is a typical Old World cuckoo, but it has taken the brood parasitism model and added its own peculiar twist. There are many ways to cuckold the host! And yet despite its labour-saving breeding and a seeming abundance of potential hosts, it remains a relatively scarce bird throughout southern Africa.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Adults of this, the larger of southern Africa’s two pelican species, are easily distinguished from Pink-backed Pelicans by their whitish plumage that contrasts with their blackish flight feathers. Just before breeding, adults have a distinct yellow breast patch, the remainder of their plumage is tinged pinkish, and they develop swollen knobs on their foreheads. Females are smaller than males, have longer occipital crests, and prior to breeding have orange (not yellow) facial skin. Juveniles and immatures are harder to tell apart from Pink-backed Pelicans, but they are larger and have baggier, yellowish (not pinkish grey) gular pouches.</p><p>The Great White Pelican is one of the heaviest flying birds. Males weigh up to 15 kilograms and have a wingspan of up to 3.6 metres, rivalling that of Wandering Albatrosses. But unlike the albatrosses, their wings are broad with deeply slotted outer primaries, similar to those of vultures and large eagles, which allow them to soar and circle efficiently. They use thermals or slopes to gain altitude, gliding effortlessly to their next feeding site. They further increase their flight efficiency by flying in V-formations, using the leading bird to reduce drag.</p><p>The Great White Pelican is one of the heaviest flying birds.

They use thermals or slopes to gain altitude, gliding effortlessly to their next feeding site. They further increase their flight efficiency by flying in V-formations, using the leading bird to reduce drag.</p><p>Oscar Wilde’s ditty is quite correct; a pelican’s beak does hold more than its belly can. Their flexible lower mandibles allow the gular pouch to distend massively. They spear their heads under water, inflating the pouch, draining the water through the sides of the bill before lifting their heads to swallow any fish, frogs or other prey. They often work in groups, synchronising their foraging thrusts to herd schools of fish into the shallows with U-shaped lines, or corralling them completely when the flanks close around the school. However, they are not confined to feeding in water. They scavenge from fishermen in Walvis Bay and at offal dumps. During the 1990s hundreds of Great White Pelicans fed on chicken offal fed to pigs near Cape Town. This easy source of food triggered a rapid increase in the Western Cape population, and coincided with adults regularly hunting seabird chicks on nearby breeding islands. This creates a conservation dilemma, given the poor conservation status of several of these seabirds, including cormorants, gannets and even penguins.</p><p>Great White Pelicans are patchily distributed throughout Africa and Eurasia, with 80% found in Africa. Southern Africa has 8 000 pairs in four breeding populations (10% of the African population) with colonies on Dassen Island, Lake St Lucia, Bird Rock platform north of Walvis Bay, and an itinerant population that breeds at Hardap Dam, Lake Ngami, Sua Pan and Etosha Pan when conditions permit. There may be some movement between populations (e.g. between the Western Cape and Namibia), and the inland population may disperse into Zambia and Angola. Although breeding sites are used repeatedly for many years, they do shift sites if disturbed. For example, in the Western Cape they initially bred on Robben Island, and had stints on Dyer Island and Seal Island in False Bay before moving to Dassen Island in 1956.</p><p>They breed colonially on islands or sometimes in reed beds. They are monogamous, but seldom retain the same mate in successive years. Once paired, the female forms a large nest scrape with her bill, which she lines with vegetation and feathers delivered by the male. The 1-3 eggs are incubated with the large, webbed feet. Hatching is staggered, and the first-hatched chick invariably kills its younger sibling(s), repeatedly pecking at its head when the parents are absent. The surviving chick fledges about 10 weeks after hatching. They return to the natal colony to breed once 3-4 years old.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Pterodroma is the largest petrel genus, with more than 30 species worldwide. Popularly known as gadfly petrels, they are renowned for their aerial agility. Their flight action is an exaggerated dynamic soaring, hanging high above the sea before diving down into a wave trough, and then rising steeply into the air again. A bird progressing steadily in a series of towering loops will suddenly roll over and accelerate, twisting and turning with deep, erratic wing beats, for no apparent reason. It looks as though it is trying to evade an invisible pursuer.</p><p>The Great-winged Petrel is a large, wholly dark brown gadfly petrel. It is most likely to be confused with a White-chinned Petrel or even a Sooty Shearwater, but its flight is quite different, even if it isn’t the most dramatic of gadfly petrels. It is also smaller than both of these species, with narrower, more angled wings and a short, stubby, black bill. It is one of a small set of Southern Ocean petrels that breeds in winter, and is unique in then dispersing north into temperate and subtropical waters in summer. It is most abundant off southern Africa in summer, when it is among the most common birds in oceanic waters, but is less common over the continental shelf. It frequently rests on the water, especially in calm weather, forming small rafts, sometimes with Leach’s Storm Petrels. It is rare in midwinter, suggesting that both adults and juveniles move south in late summer and spring. The first arrivals return to our waters in September, well before the end of the breeding season: these are presumably a mix of failed breeders and non-breeders. As soon as they reach temperate waters they start primary moult, replacing the inner 3-4 primaries, leaving a large gap in the wing.</p><p>The Great-winged Petrel is a large, wholly dark brown gadfly petrel.

Squid are their main prey, but they are seldom seen to feed, so are presumed to catch most prey at night. Quite how they do so is unknown; they are unlikely to be proficient divers, as their combination of long wings and dense plumage renders them buoyant, and their legs are not laterally compressed as is typical of the better-diving petrels. When they are seen to feed, most prey is taken by surface-seizing or shallow plunge dives. They scavenge scraps from fishing boats but only when there are few other birds about. For this reason they can be the most common birds attending trawlers off Namibia in summer, but they never achieve this status off the Cape.</p><p>Great-winged Petrels were hard hit by feral cats on South Africa’s Marion Island because they were one of the few species present on the island in winter. Breeding success tripled after cats were eradicated from the island in the early 1990s, and it is hoped that their numbers will now slowly increase. The population on the main island of Tristan also suffered from direct exploitation, and although this practice has now ceased, the population remains tiny, due to ongoing predation by rats. Introduced predators also have affected populations at the Crozets and Kerguelen. Despite these impacts, the population is large, with at least 100 000 pairs, and is not considered to be threatened.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>My first sighting of this bird in Durban’s Burman Bush many decades ago caused me some problems. In the bird books available at the time I could not find any illustration that remotely resembled the diminutive, wren-like bird with vertically cocked tail and fluffy white undertail coverts that I had spent some time observing. Despite these early identification difficulties, I got to know this bird quite well, because I spent a lot of time in its favoured habitat. It is one of the most common species in the undergrowth of moist coastal forests and in the dense thickets in drier habitats. It gleans leaves of low vegetation and also forages on the ground, peeking under fallen leaves and twigs, rather than tossing them aside as a thrush does. It also associates with small forest antelopes such as Blue Duikers, using them as beaters, and snapping up small insects disturbed by the animal’s passage through the undergrowth.</p><p>Despite its diminutive size and skulking habits, this camaroptera is a very vocal species. It investigates any intrusion and bleats plaintively if it encounters potential danger. The bleat sounds very similar to that made by a goat kid that has lost sight of its mother. Many a goatherd has doubtless been misled, following up calls of small goats that turn out to be made by small birds, so it is no surprise that Zulus call this bird umBuzana (little goat).</p><p>Despite its diminutive size and skulking habits, this camaroptera is a very vocal species.

Many a goatherd has doubtless been misled, following up calls of small goats that turn out to be made by small birds, so it is no surprise that Zulus call this bird umBuzana (little goat).</p><p>Camaropteras are often the first to detect the approach of stealth predators such as snakes or mongooses. Their bleated alarm calls thus provide an early-warning system that is well understood by other birds sharing their habitat. One of these, the Red-capped Robin-Chat Cossypha natalensis, actually teaches its fledglings to associate the bleat of the camaroptera with danger by interspersing its own alarm calls with perfect bleat imitations.</p><p>The alarm bleat is not very loud, but like its close relative the Grey-backed Cama&#173;roptera, it has a repertoire of attention-catching calls, mostly variations on a theme that can be likened to the clicking together of two pebbles, a rhythmic ‘kwit, kwit, kwit’, often accompanied by audible wing snaps. This is used in territorial advertisement and so is commonly heard after the fall of the first spring rains. Audible wing snapping is also a prominent part of boundary disputes and pursuits of trespassers by territory owners.</p><p>Camaropteras have specialised nest-building techniques, stitching together large leaves with spider silk like the more famous tailorbirds of Asia. The Green-backed Camaroptera is fond of frequenting stands of buckweed (Isoglossa woodii), a common undergrowth plant of evergreen forest patches along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, and it often builds its nest in these large-leaved (120 x 70 mm) plants. Two or more leaves are selected, pierced around their edges, and strands of spider web inserted through the perforations to stitch the leaves together. Within this purse-shaped receptacle, an inner wall of fine grass and bark fibres is built and lined with vegetable down, often derived from milkweeds. An extra leaf is frequently pulled down and stitched over the top of the nest, effectively hiding the entrance from above.</p><p>Such nests are difficult to find because they blend so well with the supporting foliage. Their concealment avails them little, however, from the attention of the Emerald Cuckoo, for which this camaroptera is the only properly confirmed host in southern Africa. There are insufficient records to estimate the proportion of nests parasitised by this cuckoo, but the Green-backed Camaroptera is a common bird and is obviously not significantly affected by this cuckoo’s attentions. Like other insectivorous African passerines, it enjoys a lengthy lifespan for its size, with some living for more than seven years.&#9;</p>",

Here they are most likely to be found in the thickets. It would appear that this species needs to drink water daily, and this probably explains their absence in the central Kalahari.

They also eat termites and their alates.</p><p>The birds nest mainly in summer, although there have been breeding records in all months throughout the year. I found that the birds in the Marondera area tended to nest about six weeks to two months after the first heavy rains, when many of the grasses had developed crops of green seeds. The birds build a ball-shaped nest of grass which has an entrance sloping downwards on one side. One of the interesting habits of this species I observed was that when either bird entered the nest, it dragged a feather into the nest entrance. When the bird left the nest the feather was pushed out and left on the side of the nest entrance. This possibly indicates that a bird approaching a nest would know whether its mate was inside. It is also possible that the lack of the feather at the entrance would caution the incoming bird about entering in case a predator was in the nest. Certainly the pair which nested in our garden did this throughout the nesting period.</p><p>The eggs took about two weeks to hatch and the chicks required another three weeks of parental care before they were ready to leave the nest. The chicks returned to the nest to sleep for the night of the day on which they left the nest, but then seemed to disappear from our garden. The adults did, however, sleep in the nest for some weeks after the chicks had fledged.</p><p>The Green-winged Pytilia is parasitised by the Long-tailed Paradise Whydah. The whydahs lay their eggs in the pytilia’s nest. Both the pytilia’s and the whydah’s eggs are plain white but the whydah’s eggs are slightly larger. The whydah chicks grow up amicably with the pytilia’s chicks and it is noticeable that they have mouth spots which resemble those of the pytilia chicks.</p>",

The tail is grey but the two outer pairs of feathers are startlingly white.</p><p>It was to be some years before I got to have a good look at this species again and this time it was a bird displaying above the brachystegia woodlands at Peterhouse, giving a fairly distinctive ‘skeee-aa’  call. One of the most noticeable features of this bird is that as it flies, it dips its tail and fans it, showing the white outer rectrices very clearly.</p><p>When two or more birds pursue one another they give a metallic ‘tsit-tsit’ call.  The flight in these pursuits is erratic and from time to time as a following bird approaches the leader, it glides with the wings held vertically and the tail fanned, thus exposing both the white outer tail feathers.</p><p>In southern Africa they are known to be brood parasites of African Yellow White-eyes. One female honeybird was observed sitting near a Yellow White-eye’s nest. When the white-eye left the nest the honeybird flew down to the nest and removed one egg. The following morning the honeybird flew to the nest after the white-eye left early in the morning and sat in the nest, presumably to lay an egg, and then removed another egg from the nest. The white-eye returned and chased the honeybird away, but then returned to the nest to continue incubation.</p><p>The honeybird egg hatches after about 12 or 13 days and the chick has a hook at the tip of its bill with which it lacerates any host chicks which hatch thereafter. Honeybirds may lay two eggs in one nest, and I have seen a Yellow White-eye feeding two honeybird chicks, but whether these were eggs laid by the same female or were two eggs laid by different females, I had no way of knowing. Quite how the second chick which hatched survived the murderous attention of the other chick, is unknown. The bill hook disappears after seven days, and by the time the feathers start appearing at twelve days, the honeybird chicks lived amicably together.</p><p>During the late summer and winter months this species is a regular member of the mixed bird parties foraging in the miombo woodlands. They forage in the canopy and midstorey, seldom coming down to the ground. They hunt from perches, scanning for suitable prey, and could be confused with a small, plump flycatcher. When prey is spotted they pick it up and eat it before flying onto another perch to look for further food. They appear to be essentially insectivorous but also eat scaled insects, beetles, bugs, termites and caterpillars. They have also been recorded as eating the sticky fruits of the Loranthus mistletoes which are common in the woodlands.</p>",

It falls within the cuckoo family but is more closely related to Asian malkohas than to African coucals. It is a medium-sized coucal, which has a greenish-grey back. The breast and belly are more buff or olive grey than the back. The head is an olive grey with a conspicuous crimson eye. The long tail is slightly iridescent green but often appears black, depending on how the light strikes it. The fairly large bill is bright yellow and draws attention to the bird as it creeps around in thickets, even when the light is poor. Because they are quite noisy birds one often hears them long before you see them. The most characteristic call is a series of metallic clicks which accelerate and then switch to a loud trill. This tails off in a series of clucking notes. During the breeding season in early summer, the birds have a mournful repetitive ‘kweee-eep, kweee-eep, kweee-eep...’ This call can be written ‘kou-lee, kou-lee’. Other calls have been described as a whinnying ‘wipwipwip...’, also screeches, chuckles and whistles.</p><p>The Green Malkoha is essentially a tropical bird which extends southwards through the forests of Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe down to KwaZulu-Natal as far south as Durban, with occasional vagrants reaching the Eastern Cape.</p><p>The Green Malkoha is essentially a tropical bird which extends southwards through the forests of Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe down to KwaZulu-Natal as far south as Durban, with occasional vagrants reaching the Eastern Cape.</p><p>This species is found mainly in indigenous forests and particularly along rivers with dense riparian vegetation, also areas of dense vegetation with tangled growth and, in the south, also in coastal thicket. In suitable habitat it may be quite common, but because of its skulking habits it is often overlooked and is generally considered to be rather rare. Although usually thought of as a lowland bird, in eastern Zimbabwe it is found in forests at more than 1&#160;000 metres above sea level, in the Mount Selinda forests and surrounds.</p><p>This bird eats a great variety of small vertebrates and invertebrates, especially insects, beetles and caterpillars; it will even take small birds out of mist nets, and occasionally feeds on fruit and seed. Unusually for a bird this size, it occasionally joins mixed-species bird parties, but even when doing so, it still keeps to the thicker tangles.</p><p>It is interesting that there appears to be little or no courtship display; the male merely approaches the female with food which he feeds her once copulation has started. The male holds onto the female’s bill and the female is unable to eat the food until the male dismounts and leaves in search of more food. The pair builds a rather flimsy nest, which may resemble debris, with a basin in the middle. Apparently the nest is sometimes domed which is what coucals usually build. This is placed in a thicket 2-5 metres above the ground and is difficult to locate.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Green Wood-Hoopoe is normally found in flocks of three to seven birds, but parties of up to fourteen have been recorded. The flock consists of an alpha male and female, who breed and are assisted in the breeding and in territorial defence by the rest of the flock. The flock is not strictly speaking a family unit although many, or most, of the birds may be the young of the alpha male and female from previous years.</p><p>Green Wood-Hoopoes are well known for their loud, cackling calls from which the Afrikaans name kakelaar is derived. A shortened cackle is used as a contact call between members of the flock – often when the flock is moving from one tree to the next. The full cackling call is a group effort which is used by the birds to advertise or defend their territory. If it happens that they call at or near the edge of their territory and the flock in the neighbouring territory is nearby, the two flocks may gather and try to ‘outshout’ each other. During this contest, termed a ‘rally display’, the birds wave their wings around and bob (their bodies) up and down. They may even pick up leaves and sticks and wave them like flags in an effort to appear more aggressive than the other flock and keep them out of their territory; this is termed the ‘flag-waving display’. Ritualised displays such as these obviate the need for potentially dangerous fights.</p><p>Green Wood-Hoopoes are well known for their loud, cackling calls from which the Afrikaans name kakelaar is derived.

Ritualised displays such as these obviate the need for potentially dangerous fights.</p><p>The birds forage by moving up the trunks of trees and out along the branches into the leaves of the canopy. They move with a jumping action, whereby the feet are moved simultaneously up the trunk. They lack the stiff tail of the woodpeckers and cannot, therefore, brace themselves with their tail, but do still use their tail for balance as they move about and don’t often forage on the ground. The curved bill is used to probe into cracks of the bark and is an efficient tool for extracting grubs from behind pieces of loose bark. They also visit flower&#173;ing trees in search of nectar, particularly the Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala and Coral trees Erythrina spp.</p><p>The nest is a hole in a tree, most often a natural cavity. However, they also use the holes of larger woodpeckers and barbets. After mating, the alpha female lays the eggs on the bare wood at the bottom of the hole. Thereafter she does all the incubation. She is fed in or close to the nest by the rest of the flock, only leaving the nest once or twice during the day. The female continues to stay in the nest with the young for about two weeks after they hatch. Once the chicks are bigger the female leaves the nest, but still intercepts most of the helpers arriving with food and distributes the food herself. After they have left the nest, young may be fed by flock members for as long as four months – this prolonged care is typical of co-operative breeders. Within groups, there are distinct dominance hierarchies within the sexes, related to age. This means that those at the bottom of the pecking order may have to wait a long time before they have any chance of attaining a breeding position in their natal group.</p><p>In the Eastern Cape, Green Wood-Hoopoes are single-brooded. Observations in the Save Conservancy in Zimbabwe, however, showed that a group can renest in the same hole soon after the successful fledging of a brood of chicks, presumably in response to high food availability. &#9;</p>",

Five related species are restricted to the forests of Equatorial Africa, several of which have extremely restricted ranges. Together, they are called gladiator shrikes because of their large size and fierce demeanour. The Grey-headed Bush-Shrike is the only representative of the group to inhabit savanna woodlands, and this habitat choice has facilitated its wide range both north and south of the Equator.</p><p>Despite this shrike’s large size, the common experience of observers is that it is more often heard than seen. Its Afrikaans name refers to its ‘ghostly’ call, a mournful, hooted ‘whoooooo’, sometimes ending with an upward inflexion ‘whoooo-up’. Given the loud and pleasant whistled calls of other Bush-Shrikes, this is not the sort of sound one would expect from a related bird. The female of a pair occasionally gives a harsh ‘keeer-keeer-keeer’ call in duet with the mate’s drawn out ‘whoooooo’.</p><p>Despite this shrike’s large size, the common experience of observers is that it is more often heard than seen.

The female of a pair occasionally gives a harsh ‘keeer-keeer-keeer’ call in duet with the mate’s drawn out ‘whoooooo’.</p><p>Another commonly uttered call is a loud ‘click-click’ followed by a quiet ‘poooh’ during which the bird lowers its head until its beak is touching its breast. The quiet part of this call is unlikely to be heard unless the bird is close by, but the loud double click carries well and sounds just like somebody using a pair of hedge clippers to trim foliage, causing some observers to dub it the ‘hedge-clipper’ call. The resemblance is so convincing that an un-named homeowner is on record for dashing out of his house to confront the uninvited person whom he thought was feloniously snipping away in his garden.</p><p>Grey-headed Bush-Shrikes normally occur in pairs; solitary individuals are likely to have lost a mate or not yet found one. I saw my first one many years ago near the town of Barberton, Mpumalanga. I was walking along a track through a young Eucalyptus plantation when one landed in the middle of the track to catch a beetle. It quickly flew back up to a perch in the adjacent trees and instantly seemed to vanish, so still did it stand and so perfectly did the soft green colour of its back and tail merge with the background of foliage.</p><p>Grey-headed Bush-Shrikes forage at all levels but spend much of their time searching foliage and twigs in tree crowns, descending to the ground only when they see potential prey. They have formidably large bills which they do not hesitate to use on vertebrates, including rodents, bats, lizards, chameleons and small snakes. They also rob other birds’ nests, taking both eggs and chicks. Most of their daily fare, however, comprises invertebrates such as beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets. Large prey may be wedged into the fork of a branch to aid dismemberment, while smaller items are merely held down with a foot. They are the only bush-shrike in southern Africa to impale prey on thorns and to maintain a ‘larder’ like the Common Fiscal, but this form of food caching appears to be rare in Grey-headed Bush-Shrikes.</p><p>A Grey-headed Bush-Shrike has been observed to kill a Single-striped Mouse weighing over 75 grams and to carry it 11 metres in flight. The average mass of this shrike is 76 grams, so the bird’s ability to carry its own weight demonstrates the power of these predators.</p><p>The birds build a large cup-shaped nest of thick twigs lined with fine material. It is usually hidden in a thicker patch of leaves or a mistletoe bunch, but occasionally is on an exposed lateral branch fork. Chicks are fed with insects, including quite large beetles.</p>",

Birds from this population differ notably in their streaking and general colouration from their congeners 250 km further south; further research might reveal that the Namibian population constitutes a separate species altogether.</p><p>Although not overly visually conspicuous, Grey-backed Cisticolas are nevertheless confiding and expressive birds that will allow a close approach and frequently perch in exposed positions on the tops of bushes. Their flight is rather weak and fluttering, usually low over the bushes, often while flicking the tail repeatedly. Additionally, this species possesses a powerful voice that betrays its whereabouts. During the height of the spring breeding season, when much of their normally arid breeding range is transformed into a wonderland of wild flowers, they can become positively noisy, the males singing incessantly and launching into short display flights over their territories. Indeed, as I sit typing this I can hear the bubbling trills, rising whistles, buzzy calls and soft clicking communications from a pair that breeds in the strandveld surrounding my Langebaan office.</p><p>One of the probable reasons for the Grey-backed Cisticola’s abundance is the fact that it is the only large cisticola species present throughout most of its range (apart from Levaillant’s Cisticola, which prefers wetland habitats). However, it often occurs alongside and possibly competes with the ecologically similar Karoo Prinia. Both species forage primarily in low bushes or on the ground, occasionally fluttering out to catch passing insects. At a distance the two are also superficially similar in their build, colouration and nervous, jerky, hyperactive movements.</p><p>Grey-backed Cisticolas are monogamous and are usually encountered in pairs throughout the year. At the onset of the breeding season, the male performs an entertaining, ‘dancing’ flight over the female, hovering clumsily while jerking his tail up and down. The nest is built in a low, dense shrub and is very well concealed. One nest was located right next to a busy footpath in the West Coast National Park; unsurprisingly, hardly any of the passing visitors discovered the nest’s existence. The nest is constructed of dry plant material bound together with spider web, and measures roughly 12 cm high by 8 cm wide. A small entrance hole near the top of one side leads to a padded, inner nesting chamber. Between two and five eggs are laid, which vary considerably in their colour and markings. The chicks hatch after about two weeks and leave the nest two weeks later to hide in the surrounding scrub. &#9;</p>",

The species is absent from Lesotho, high parts of the Drakensberg and the coastal lowlands of the Eastern Cape Province. Movements of Grey-backed Sparrow-Larks are complex. They are highly nomadic, but also have some regular seasonal movements. In the southern Nama Karoo, a few birds can be seen in spring and summer, regardless of the environmental conditions. However, in above-average rainfall years, the birds may appear in hundreds, and in the central Nama Karoo and the more arid parts of the range, may even appear in flocks of thousands. In very dry years in the north-west of the region, Grey-backed Sparrow-Larks may move east as far as central Zimbabwe and the lowlands of eastern South Africa.</p><p>Most often, non-breeding Grey-backed Sparrow-Larks are in small loose groups, occasionally in pairs, and sometimes in mixed flocks with Stark’s Larks, Lark-like Buntings, and Chestnut-backed (in the north) and Black-eared Sparrow-Larks (further south). The birds forage in small groups, pecking at items on the ground, sometimes uncovering buried seeds or other food items with a sideways flick of the bill. In the Namib Desert and Bushmanland they eat mostly grass seeds, together with some green plant matter and invertebrates. Forb seeds that are eaten include those of the alien saltbush Atriplex lindleyi. This saltbush holds its seeds singly inside an inflated pod, and the sparrow-larks are adept at breaking the pod open and extracting the small, brown seed. Their invertebrate food includes termite workers and alates, and locust hoppers. They drink regularly if water is available, but can survive without access to water, garnering their water from dry seeds.</p><p>Most often, non-breeding Grey-backed Sparrow-Larks are in small loose groups, occasionally in pairs, and sometimes in mixed flocks with Stark’s Larks, Lark-like Buntings, and Chestnut-backed (in the north) and Black-eared Sparrow-Larks (further south).

In such high-density areas, they regularly nest in association with Stark’s Larks. Males display while singing over the nesting area in a circling flight 15 to 30 metres above the ground; the display ends with the bird diving to ground.</p><p>The nest is built by the female, who is sometimes accompanied on material-gather&#173;ing trips by the male. Placed at the base of a shrub, grass tuft or stone, the nest is a cup of fine dry stems and leaves, lined with feathery awns of grasses, fluffy seeds or, occasionally, wool. The nest is sunk into a hollow and built on a foundation of small stones or earth clods. The open side of the nest, usually facing south or east for shade, has an apron of stones. Incubation is by both sexes, more frequently by the male during the day. Chick-rearing duties are shared, but not equally, with the female doing disproportionately more. Nestlings are fed on caterpillars and grasshoppers, and probably termites (because termites respond to similar environmental cues as the breeding sparrow-larks and would be available when the birds have chicks). The chicks leave the nest before they can fly and totter off after their parents away from the nest. Within a day or two the chicks can run and crouch when alarmed, and they can fly at just over two weeks after leaving the nest.</p>",

However, at times they can be quite confiding, feeding behind slow-moving or stationary vessels. They are often seen in association with drifting mats of seaweed, especially the Giant Kelp Macrocystis pyrifera.

The head is topped with a crown of stiff golden feathers. In flight it is equally striking, with white and golden wing coverts contrasting with the black and chestnut flight feathers.</p><p>Their long hind toes allow them to perch in trees or on similar structures.

But their most common call, the honking ‘ma-hem’, differs from other crane calls and is often heard during the day, especially when they take to flight.</p><p>In southern Africa, most Grey Crowned Cranes are found in the mixed grassland-wetland mosaic of South Africa and Zimbabwe, each of which are home to several thousand birds, with a few in north-east Namibia, northern Botswana and central-northern Mozambique. They are listed as globally Endangered, due to rapid population decreases in much of their range, but the population in South Africa appears to be fairly stable at 6&#160;000 to 7&#160;000 birds.</p><p>Pairing for life, Grey Crowned Cranes have a unison call and a breeding display that involves dancing, bowing, jumping, running, stick and grass tossing, and wing flapping. They are strongly territorial and use the same nest sites year on year within wetlands. They flatten vegetation in a wide circle and create a large platform nest by pulling up reeds and grasses. By selecting sites in tall vegetation, the incubating bird is often invisible from the edge of the wetland. At ground level, nests are best detected when partners change shifts, but they are easily spotted from the air. One pair in the Marondera area built a floating nest in a dam. They flattened bulrushes (Typha) and then built a substantial platform on the flattened stems. There are also three accounts of these cranes nesting in large trees in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  On hatching, the chicks were unceremoniously kicked out of the nest to start their life on the ground. Pairs raise one to three (rarely four) chicks each season. Both adults raise the chicks and protect them from predators. In one instance, I watched a pair leave their two chicks to move back towards the Wakkerstroom wetland while the adults took turns following a large dog moving through their territory until it no longer posed a threat to the chicks.</p><p>Stripping seeds off grass stems, and catching insects, the family groups forage primarily in grasslands and along the edge of wetlands, returning to the wetland to roost. Both parents may roost with the chicks in the wetland, but often one or even both may leave the chicks to roost in a nearby tree. Once the chicks can fly, they all roost together in trees, provided suitable trees exist.</p><p>Grey Crowned Crane families join up with non-breeding birds to form flocks in winter, often foraging for insects and spilled grain in harvested lands. The birds in these flocks often dance together, mimicking an elaborate ballet where everyone plays a part. Such dances include those between partners, strengthening pair bonds, but they also include threat displays between pairs, featuring ruffled feather threats, walk threats and bow threats. The adults leave the juveniles behind when they move back to the breeding territories for the next breeding season.</p>",

However, it also has a hooked beak like a true shrike. In point of fact, it is not related to either cuckoos or shrikes, and current evidence suggests that cuckooshrikes are closer to orioles than to any other family of birds.</p><p>The Cuckooshrike family Campephagidae, which includes the minivets and trillers, contains more than 90 species, most of them resident in tropical Asia and the Australasian faunal region. Only thirteen species occur in Africa, and only three extend into southern African. Coracina is by far the largest genus, with more than fifty species.</p><p>The Cuckooshrike family Campephagidae, which includes the minivets and trillers, contains more than 90 species, most of them resident in tropical Asia and the Australasian faunal region. Only thirteen species occur in Africa, and only three extend into southern African. Coracina is by far the largest genus, with more than fifty species.</p><p>The Grey Cuckooshrike is a bird of the fragmented Afromontane forests, extending in isolated populations from Ethiopia down to the southern Cape. It is a partial altitudinal migrant in many regions (some of the population move down to forest habitats at lower altitudes in winter, but others are resident), and is one of the few montane forest birds to also have representative populations in the isolated West African montane forests such as on Mount Cameroon. This is significant because it suggests that this cuckooshrike can survive in non-forest habitats and is not dependent on localised forest fragments as are many of Africa’s rare birds. One would not expect Grey Cuckooshrikes to frequent urban areas, yet Richard Dean has more than once encountered them foraging in trees lining streets in small coastal towns in the southern Cape. They move into George along riparian forest corridors that line the streams running off the mountains behind the town.</p><p>Grey Cuckooshrikes are often unobtrusive, perching quietly for extended periods in the shade of canopy foliage. They are handsome birds, clad in soft grey plumage with a strongly-contrasting jet-black eye. Most birders probably only encounter them as actively foraging members of the mixed bird parties that are so much a feature of forest habitats, especially in the non-breeding season.</p><p>Grey Cuckooshrikes are not vocally conspicuous, for their usual call is a faint, high-pitched, descending, whistled ‘tsseeeee’. They preferentially forage in the forest canopy, peering about, occasionally flicking a wing, and snatching prey from the undersides of leaves that are within reach or a short flight away. Like many other birds, they hawk flying termite alates. Prey captured in flight is only prepared for swallowing after return to the perch. Insects (beetles, crickets, ‘grasshoppers’, caterpillars, termites) and spiders form the bulk of identified food in stomachs. There is one observation of a Grey Cuckooshrike eating a berry from a strangler fig, but there are no other records of fruit-eating by this species.</p><p>Their nests, constructed largely from Old Man’s Beardlichen (Usnea), are usually placed in a fork in a horizontal or gently-sloping branch 15&#160;m or more above the ground and are not easy to find unless the birds are seen building. Because of the comparative inaccessibility of such nest sites, very little is recorded about the breeding biology. Juveniles have extensively barred plumage both above and below and in this respect are unlike the young of any other cuckooshrike in the region.</p><p>Because it is easily overlooked, the Grey Cuckooshrike may not be as ‘uncommon’ as often reported. They are occasionally observed in atypical habitat in unexpected regions, and such records are likely due to altitudinal migrant individuals searching for forested environments.</p>",

Within the southern African subregion, it occurs from northern and central Namibia, east across north-eastern Botswana to Zimbabwe, North West and Limpopo Provinces, northern Gauteng, lowlands of Mpumalanga and adjacent southern Mozambique, Swaziland and north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal. The habitat of the Grey Go-away-bird is dry savanna, particularly Acacia savanna, but it also occurs in broad-leaved Burkea Burkea africana woodland, the edges of miombo (Brachystegia) woodland, dry riverine woodland with Acacia trees along the edges of forest, and in rural and suburban gardens.</p><p>Grey Go-away-birds are mostly resident, but may be locally nomadic. Wandering individuals have been observed outside of their usual habitat, and these may facilitate the colonisation of novel habitats. Grey Go-away-birds were rare vagrants to the Witwatersrand prior to the 1970s. During the drought of 1978, they arrived in suburban gardens in Johannesburg, and have remained as a garden bird ever since. They nest in farmstead gardens, and evidently must nest in suburban gardens also. Grey Go-away-birds are usually solitary nesters, with only one pair at the nest, but may be co-operative breeders at times. Courtship displays are simple; the female solicits mating with wings held open and quivering. The nest is a rather flimsy platform of twigs up to 30 cm in diameter, with a shallow depression in the centre for the eggs. It is usually built about 5 metres above ground in the canopy of a dry and often fairly bare, and very often thorny, tree, sometimes in or near an old nest site. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, and the sitting bird may be remarkably reluctant to leave the nest – in one observation the sitting bird remained on the nest while enveloped in smoke from a grass fire. Nestlings leave the nest at about 18 to 21 days old, before they are able to fly, and clamber awkwardly about near the nest from about 23 days old. Fledglings fly at about 35 days old, and remain at least partially dependent on their parents until about 40 days old.</p><p>Grey Go-away-birds are mostly resident, but may be locally nomadic.

Fruits and flowers of a wide range of wild and cultivated fruits are eaten, including the small fruits of mistletoe and the relatively large fruits of Nyala-tree Xanthocercis zambesiaca. Fruits of alien trees such as Persian Lilac and Cotoneaster, and cultivated fruits, including guavas, mulberries and peaches are eaten. Harvester Termites Hodotermes mossambicus and fifth instar larvae of the Mopane Emperor Moth Imbrasia belina are among the invertebrates in the diet.&#9;</p>",

It is steadily becoming a human commensal in our region, with the largest concentrations now occurring in the vicinity of larger towns and cities. Here they may breed on man-made dams and pans, and many feed at rubbish dumps and roadhouses, showing a special affinity for cooked potato chips at the latter, paralleling the Silver Gull C. novaehollandiae of Australia.</p><p>In fresh breeding dress this is a very handsome gull with its grey head, red bill and legs, and the yellowish-white eye surrounded by a bright red eye-ring. The young go through a series of plumages prior to assuming that of adult at about two to three years. At such times they may be confused with the young of other similar sized gulls, especially Hartlaub’s Gull. Further confusion arises from the fact that at certain coastal sites these two species have been hybridising, producing offspring that show variable characteristics of both species. Such hybridisation is particularly frequent on the central Namibian coastline, and the hybrids have left more than one birder confused. Once these hybrids reach breeding age they are thought to lack most of the grey hood of a pure Grey-headed Gull but to have pale eyes, those of Hartlaub’s Gull, being dark brown.</p><p>In fresh breeding dress this is a very handsome gull with its grey head, red bill and legs, and the yellowish-white eye surrounded by a bright red eye-ring.

They normally join gull roosts but also occur in tern roosts, especially with Swift Terns. They also breed in colonies. Colony sites may be used year after year where water levels are fairly stable, but some colonies are ephemeral, being occupied only occasionally when suitable conditions occur. Such colonies form at larger dams and lakes when water levels are low: this happens at Lake Kariba and the Manyame Lakes in Zimbabwe. In drier areas, where rainfall tends to be very erratic, breeding only takes place when suitable habitats become available when the water level recedes after heavy rain. Breeding colonies are very noisy places, with a continuous cacophony of sound advertising their presence. At inland sites, Grey-headed Gull colonies may be joined by Caspian Terns, who are quite capable of holding their own against these egg thieves and are also happy to breed under the protective umbrella afforded by the gulls. On the coast they breed alongside Hartlaub’s and Kelp Gulls, as well as Swift Terns.</p><p>After breeding, dispersal occurs widely. Ringed juveniles from Gauteng have been recorded at sites as diverse as Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and from around South Africa. The majority of birds, both adults and young, however, remain in the general vicinity of the breeding area, although a partial migration between Gauteng and the KwaZulu-Natal coast is suspected. In response to human provision of both food and additional breeding sites, this species has probably increased substantially in numbers and possibly range over the last century.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Grey-headed Kingfisher is an intra-tropical migrant. This means that it comes to southern Africa to breed and then at the end of our summer it migrates northwards to somewhere within the African tropics for our winter. It is a woodland kingfisher and prefers well-developed woodlands with tall trees and low-growing ground vegetation. The first birds arrive in our woodlands in September, and the males immediately stake out territories. The male calls from selected perches within his territory. It is noteworthy that his call is not nearly as loud as some of the other woodland kingfishers, but it is just as insistent.</p><p>Although this species superficially resembles the similarly sized Brown-hooded Kingfisher, it is a much more handsome bird, especially the male. The grey head contrasts with the light-coloured throat and breast, and the belly is bright rufous. The wings and rump are a bright blue, which is especially conspicuous when the bird is flying away; the male being noticeably brighter than the female. The bill is always a bright red, while the Brown-hooded Kingfisher has a brownish-red bill.</p><p>Although this species superficially resembles the similarly sized Brown-hooded Kingfisher, it is a much more handsome bird, especially the male.

The wings and rump are a bright blue, which is especially conspicuous when the bird is flying away; the male being noticeably brighter than the female. The bill is always a bright red, while the Brown-hooded Kingfisher has a brownish-red bill.</p><p>It nests in a hole in a bank – the hole being excavated by both sexes. This means that there have to be suitable banks available in woodland regions for the birds to establish territories and nest. The nest bank is often near the centre of the pair’s territory. Because the banks are often carved by water flowing in woodland streams, it has been suggested that the birds are associated with water. We found that banks over water were always preferred to banks out in the woodlands, but that where water was not available, they would readily nest in any sandy bank higher than approximately 50 centimetres anywhere within the woodlands. They seldom made use of banks along streams which were in open grassland. On one occasion I found a pair of these birds nesting in the side of a cattle track which was no more than 15 centimetres deep. The absence of suitable nest sites in the area had obviously forced the bird to use this very small bank.</p><p>In Gosho Environmental Education Park at Peterhouse School, Marondera, Zimbabwe, the birds very readily took to the banks we dug for them. We managed to more than double the number of breeding pairs in the conservation area by providing these ‘artificial’ nesting banks. It also makes extensive use of Aardvark burrows,where it digs its tunnel into the roof of the burrow. When seen from a distance, the bird, returning to the nest, just seems to disappear into the ground as it dives down into the burrow. It comes out flying at a tremendous speed and usually heads straight for the nearest tree, where it alights and checks for any danger. It often has a particular perch which is used when going to and from the nest. During the breeding season, the pair is highly territorial and will chase any other Grey-headed Kingfishers away but after the chicks have fledged, the pair seems to be more tolerant of other kingfishers.</p><p>This kingfisher is not a fish eater. It feeds on insects, geckos and lizards, and even tree frogs; the prey is normally caught on the ground. However, they may also snatch geckos and lizards off the bark of trees. The bird sits on a perch, at no great height above the ground, watching for any movement on the ground below and when movement is spotted, the bird flies down and pounces on the prey. Smaller prey is swallowed immediately, but larger items are carried up to a perch where it is bashed against a branch to soften it before being swallowed.   &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>That the Grey-headed Parrot is a separate species from the Cape Parrot is now trite, or should be. The head is silvery, not golden, in colour, and it is larger than that species, with a more powerful beak. It shows the same pattern of sexual and age dimorphism in plumage as found in the Cape Parrot, with the adult male anomalously lacking the red forehead. But it is a radical difference in habitat that most sets the two apart. In southern Africa, the Grey-headed Parrot occurs in sweltering, low-lying tropical woodlands, especially along lowland rivers. It is typical of Mopane Colophospermum mopane woodland, often with gigantic Baobabs Adansonia digitata, and it also inhabits Brachystegia woodland. The closest the two come to meeting is in north-eastern South Africa, where a small outlier of Cape Parrots occurs in the cool highland forests of the escarpment perched well above the nearest populations of the Grey-headed Parrot in the hot lowland savannas below. Whether the two subspecies of the Grey-headed Parrot, suahelicus of central and southern Africa and the poorly known nominate of West Africa, are truly conspecific is another matter. The scientific name of this form may still be in for a further change.</p><p>The Grey-headed Parrot also differs from its southern counterpart in diet, as documented by Craig Symes, the foremost student of the species. Food is taken from a wide variety of trees. In north-eastern South Africa, the Mabola Plum Parinari curatellifolia is a staple out of the breeding period and the Marula Sclerocarya birrea may be important in the pre-breeding period. During the actual nesting period, the fruits of the Velvet-leaved Corkwood Commiphora mollis, Kudu-berry Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis, Nyala-berry Xanthocercis zambesiaca, and Purple-pod Cluster-leaf Terminalia prunioides are taken. The fruits of a water-berry Syzygium species, Mahobohobo Uapaca sp., Ficus sycomorus and even the alien White Teak Gmelina arborea are additional favourites. One study showed that these parrots move locally between mopane and mixed broad-leaved savanna and disturbed secondary growth and gardens, depending on season, as the birds track the fruiting of their preferred trees. Nectar is occasionally taken, as from the flowers of the Red-hot Poker Coral-tree Erythrina abyssinica. The regular ingestion of bark has been a surprising recent discovery and may play a similar role as geophagy in other parrots and frugivores, thought by some authorities to be related to assumed problematic secondary compounds in their diet. Occasional insect eating is suspected, but needs confirmation. Grey-headed Parrots apparently only rarely raid crops, such as pecan nuts, maize, millet and sorghum.</p><p>The Grey-headed Parrot also differs from its southern counterpart in diet, as documented by Craig Symes, the foremost student of the species.

Grey-headed Parrots apparently only rarely raid crops, such as pecan nuts, maize, millet and sorghum.</p><p>This species and the Cape Parrot feed largely on the kernels of unripe fruit, which essentially eliminates competition with other frugivores, but makes the parrots ‘seed predators’ rather than seed dispersers. Occasionally Grey-headed Parrots fly off with fruit held in their feet and therefore they may play some minor role in seed dispersal. Parrots and owls are the only two birds capable of lifting food to the bill with their feet, which greatly enhances their food-handling capabilities. As an aside, most Grey-headed Parrots are ‘left-footed’, as with several other African parrots.</p><p>In southern Africa, Grey-headed Parrots typically breed in winter (March to August), distinct from the summer breeding of the Cape Parrot. An Archangel Display, where the wings are pulled back, exposing the red leading edge, is prominent in nuptial and agonistic interactions in this species (and the Cape Parrot). Where they are available, Baobab Trees are a particular favourite for nesting. At one site, apparent competition over a nest site between a pair of these parrots and Dickinson’s Kestrel occurred but became moot when an elephant felled the tree. Males provision their mates by regurgitation during incubation and the early stages of the nestling period.</p>",

Its range in the region closely matches that of the terrestrial-living Black-headed Heron, this despite their quite different habitat preferences. On a global scale, though, Grey Herons have a substantially more extensive range than their non-aquatic counterpart, extending beyond Africa into Europe and Asia and on into the Far East as far as Japan.</p><p>The Grey Heron is a very thoroughly researched species and is probably better known than any other heron in the world. In the UK, for instance, its population (of about 4 000 pairs) has been accurately monitored since 1928, and the rises and falls in the numbers breeding in spring have been linked to the relative severity of the preceding winter. Ringing in the Northern Hemisphere has shown that the birds in the coldest latitudes migrate south, many crossing the Sahara to spend the winter in West Africa; others from Russia migrate in winter as far south as Thailand.</p><p>The Grey Heron is a very thoroughly researched species and is probably better known than any other heron in the world.

Ringing in the Northern Hemisphere has shown that the birds in the coldest latitudes migrate south, many crossing the Sahara to spend the winter in West Africa; others from Russia migrate in winter as far south as Thailand.</p><p>Southern African birds, by contrast, are non-migratory, although ringing of nestlings has shown that the young may disperse over hundreds and even a thousand or more kilometres at times. Adults move about too, but theirs is a response to changing wetland conditions. On permanent waterbodies – estuaries, lagoons, lakes, dams and rivers – Grey Herons are to be found year-round, whereas on seasonal wetlands, especially floodplains and pans, they may be present in numbers in one month and gone the next.</p><p>Primarily fish eaters, Grey Herons catch their prey by standing in shallow, open water, head and neck extended, poised to strike. They may change position from time to time, walking or flying to take up a new spot, or hunt by wading slowly forward, ever watchful. When a fish is sighted, it is snatched or impaled by the bill in a single fluid movement. Fish taken are typically 70-100 g in size, and four or five may be caught and eaten in a day. Small ones may be swallowed alive but larger prey is first worked over in the bill before being flipped into position for ingestion and then swallowed whole, headfirst. While fish are certainly their primary food, eels, frogs, crabs, aquatic insects, hatchling turtles, molluscs and probably any other aquatic prey encountered while fishing may be taken; rodents and even small birds have also been recorded on its menu, but these are probably only taken opportunistically when the chance presents itself.</p><p>As in most other members of the family, the male and female are alike, and at the start of the breeding cycle they develop elongated plumes on their chest and back, and their otherwise yellow legs, lores and base of the bill redden. The elongated black feathers that protrude from the nape are at their best at this time, and when the crown feathers are raised this flare of black amidst an otherwise white head is striking.</p><p>Grey Herons fish solitarily but when the breeding season comes around they become gregarious and nest colonially, usually in association with other communally-breeding herons, egrets, ibises, cormorants and others. The nest is a platform of sticks, the male gathering and delivering these to the female which puts the nest together. Three eggs form the usual clutch; incubation begins with the first egg and the sexes share this task, changing over several times a day. The young hatch asynchronously and there is often competition between them for the food brought in by the parents, with the youngest sibling sometimes not surviving this conflict. At about three weeks they start wandering from the nest, perching on nearby branches, and at about seven weeks they leave the parental home permanently, making their first flight to independence.</p>",

The birds have a contact call which is rendered as ‘tseewee, tseewee’ five or six times, and helps to locate the birds in the canopy.</p><p>The construction of a Penduline Tit’s nest is one of the most incredible in the whole of the bird world. The nest is often at a considerable height in the miombo woodlands and is made entirely from vegetable down, which has small hooks on one end of each of the pieces. The birds start the nest by attaching the down to a thin twig and it is then constructed as a deep bag with the entrance at the top and coming out to the side. The birds tuck new material into the nest as they proceed, and gradually the whole nest takes shape. However the most remarkable thing about this nest is that, at the entrance, they build a small tunnel about thirty or forty millimetres long. Directly below the tunnel there is a ‘false entrance’ which is made by constructing a separate loop of plant down, coming out of the nest. When a bird leaves the nest it closes the tunnel, usually by pushing the bottom of the tunnel with its head so as to expose the false entrance below. I have also watched them using their beak to close or ‘zip’ the entrance quite tightly, as the hooks on the plant down hook together like a zip, sealing the entrance completely. When the birds return they hang onto the nest just below the false entrance and reach up with one foot to pull the bottom of the tube down to open it. The bird then moves up and hangs by both feet onto the end of the ‘tube’, looks around first to make sure there is no danger, then enters the nest with food for the chicks.</p><p>When the bird came out of the nest sometimes it would not close the entrance but moved around onto the nest ‘tucking’ the bits and pieces of vegetable down back into the nest, using its bill to maintain the structure in good condition. This process could take up to ten minutes before the bird moved back to the entrance, pushed the bottom up and zipped the entrance shut. It would then fly off again to look for food for the chicks.</p>",

The first adults, probably failed breeders, return around mid-August. These birds retain some vestiges of breeding plumage but this is quickly lost over the next month or so. Because they breed so far north, where the snows retreat late, they depart southern shores rather later than most visiting wader species, and the last adults may be seen into early May. Arrival back on the breeding grounds only occurs during June, and breeding must be completed quickly to enable the birds to leave again in August.</p><p>The birds visiting southern Africa probably come from the west and central tundra regions of Siberia. We share this non-breeding population with countries from the Gulf of Guinea round the coast of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. Their southward migration route takes them down the east coast of Africa, with a proportion overflying the interior. These latter birds are probably headed for the west coast of Africa and the small numbers stopping off at larger wetlands are mostly juveniles which weaken more easily on their first migration. The numbers of juveniles in the population in any one year is related to cycles of lemming abundance on the breeding grounds, with the largest numbers of young surviving in years when lemmings are abundant and form the main food for the Arctic’s predators. The population visiting southern Africa is estimated at about 25 000 birds, with less than 10&#160;000 in southern Mozambique, about 9 000 in South Africa and 6&#160;000 in Namibia.</p><p>Although the birds are found right around our coastline there are a number of sites that are particularly important for this species, namely Walvis Bay, Langebaan Lagoon, the Swartkops estuary, and wetlands along the southern Mozambique coast. Elsewhere they may be found on any sheltered coastal site with a suitable sandy or muddy substratum. However, they also favour open shores where there are wave-cut platforms or stretches of mixed rock and sand. Sites on the open coast and smaller estuaries are generally deserted in winter when birds congregate at the most favoured locations.</p>",

These birds made extensive use of the vertical holes made by termites on the field. Some species of termites have underground nests with vertical tunnels coming out at the surface, but without a chimney protruding above ground level, and it was into these that the Grey-rumped Swallows would disappear. The birds did not seem to worry too much about the boys playing cricket on the field, and would continue about their business throughout the game!</p><p>When approaching the nest it would fly fairly low and quite slowly until it was just about above the nest, when it would drop down, landing on the edge of the hole and immediately disappear into it, almost as though it had stalled and fallen out of the sky. However, in the natural environment these birds made extensive use of rodent burrows, with the gerbil burrows being most often used because gerbils were the most common burrowing rodents in our area. Here the swallows would land just in front of the entrance and walk quickly into the burrow and disappear.</p><p>It was interesting how a burn in the grassland in August would prompt this species to start nesting in the burnt area – I presumed that the burn made the rodent burrows more visible and also cleared the grass at the approach to the burrows. We would find pairs with nests about 150-250 metres apart and could not help wondering where the food came from over the burnt area!</p><p>The birds occupied a nest chamber about a half to one metre from the entrance; the size of the chamber being large enough to take a fairly substantial pad of nesting material, mostly pieces of soft, dry grass. Presumably the birds excavated these chambers, as rodent burrows without swallows lacked these chambers near the entrance.The chamber was big enough to hold three full-grown chicks quite comfortably. When the chicks were older they would come up to the entrance of the nest to be fed, probably being alerted to the approach of the adult by the adult calling as it passed over the hole.</p>",

They normally remain under cover and even when visiting a flowering bush or tree away from the forest they rarely feed on the outer edge but prefer to remain hidden from view. The one exception to this is when they visit the Cape Strelitzia Strelitzia alba flowers from August to December in the southern Cape. Here they perch in full view and even on the top of the upper leaves, from whence they call. Within a suitable nectar-bearing source area they seem to spend more time chasing each other than feeding, flashing their red epaulettes and calling continuously.</p><p>This is essentially a coastal and sub-coastal species occurring from well west of George, where it appears to be resident, through to Somalia, although somewhat disjunctly from Mozambique northwards. The western extreme of the range may expand and contract from year to year, and birds have been known to irrupt as far west as Cape Town. Great care must be taken in identification away from areas of normal occurrence because immature males of the double-banded group may, when beginning to assume adult plumage, start showing red at the distal end of their breast band, giving the impression of pectoral tufts.</p><p>This is essentially a coastal and sub-coastal species occurring from well west of George, where it appears to be resident, through to Somalia, although somewhat disjunctly from Mozambique northwards.

An important identification feature is that the darker grey of the head is clean-cut from the lighter grey of the throat and chest. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, although duller, and has a bright orange gape. The adult males also have some yellow feathers in the pectoral tufts which are much reduced or absent in the females.</p><p>The movement status of this bird is difficult to determine, but there is a definite departure of the majority of the population from the Eastern Cape during the period late summer to midwinter. Where these birds go has not been determined, but atlassing data indicates an increase in KwaZulu-Natal at this time. In my Bathurst garden I had a large Karoo Boer-bean Schotia afra tree that flowered magnificently every year, normally during the period July to September. This tree was extremely popular with Grey Sunbirds and up to a dozen of them would occur at the peak arrival time. If the tree flowered in July no Grey Sunbird would occur, indicating absence in the district, although other species were present, but the normal flowering month was August, and that is when there was a large influx of these birds with a fairly constant turnover indicated by ringing. Despite the numbers of birds passing through my garden, the only ringed birds recaptured in subsequent seasons were the local breeders. During August it was the commonest sunbird present in the tree, and by September the numbers would tail off as birds moved on. In the one year when the tree flowered in October, only one local breeding male frequented this patch. At all times there was much inter- and intra-specific chasing, with this sunbird apparently the dominant one.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Although not overly shy, this warbler-like flycatcher can easily be overlooked if one is unfamiliar with its melancholy voice. The opposite is also true – I spent many childhood weekends trying to track down the source of an unfamiliar, weak, but highly distinctive song in the Faurea saligna woodlands of South Africa’s Waterberg Mountains. I finally managed to locate the songster and connect the mysterious sound with this species. The territorial song is heard most often: a very characteristic, melancholy, slightly trilled phrase of about one second, somewhat recalling a distant Rufous-naped Lark or a ringing telephone e.g. ‘peee’eer-purrr’ or ‘peee’lee-perrr’. This simple, but somewhat variable phrase is monotonously repeated every few seconds, often for long periods at a time. When foraging in dense vegetation, the sexes keep in contact with a regular, stuttering ‘whee-ree-tit’ call. Very rarely, it also gives a subdued, warbler-like song.</p><p>In terms of behaviour, Grey Tit-Flycatchers differ greatly from typical flycatchers. Instead of launching aerial sallies from a perch to catch insects, tit-flycatchers move about inside the canopy, sometimes slowly and meticulously, at other times restlessly and actively. They search leaves, twigs and clumps of vegetation for prey. Nevertheless, they do hawk insects inside the canopy and on occasion briefly fly out to catch a passing moth or winged termite.</p><p>In terms of behaviour, Grey Tit-Flycatchers differ greatly from typical flycatchers.

They search leaves, twigs and clumps of vegetation for prey. Nevertheless, they do hawk insects inside the canopy and on occasion briefly fly out to catch a passing moth or winged termite.</p><p>But perhaps the most memorable and entertaining aspect of watching one of these birds is hinted at by its old name of Fan-tailed Flycatcher. While foraging, this species exhibits energetic and near-constant tail movements: it fans and swings its tail up, sideways or in a circle, often with jerky, stepwise, toy-like movements. During these actions the graduated shape of the tail is discernible (the feathers decreasing in length towards the sides of the tail) and the white sides and tips to the tail contrasting sharply with its black base (which immediately distinguishes this species from the similarly-coloured Ashy Flycatcher). This fascinating tail-jerking habit might help to flush the bird’s insect prey through the vigorous movement and colour contrasts, and probably also serves as a signal to mates or rivals.</p><p>Grey Tit-Flycatchers are on the whole uncommon and localised. The reason for their fragmented occurrence patterns is unclear, as they do not seem to have highly specialised habitat requirements, being present in various denser woodland types, including miombo, mixed and broad-leaved woodland, forest edges and riverine bush. They often occur in highest densities along rivers and on the heavily wooded bases of hillsides.</p><p>Territories are large (up to 40 hectares in West Africa), and the birds may navigate their entire territory on a daily basis. Pairs frequently join mixed-species bird parties, especially in the winter non-breeding season. They remain in the canopies of medium to large trees, seldom descending lower than three to four metres above the ground (but may briefly fly to the ground to retrieve a fallen prey item). If approached cautiously, this species will usually allow a close approach from beneath before flitting to the next tree with its tail fanned.</p><p>The breeding biology of this species is poorly known. Nests are constructed in old woodpecker or barbet holes or in natural tree cavities. Juveniles have spotted plumage, supporting this species’ affinity to the flycatcher family, but contrary to its original classification as a tit-babbler. Additionally, some evidence suggests that the two species of tit-flycatchers (the other being the Grey-throated Tit-Flycatcher Myioparus griseigularis of western and central Africa) may be closely related to the Fairy Flycatcher.;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Endemic to western South Africa and south-western Namibia, the Grey Tit occurs in probably the most treeless habitat of any of the species in the family Paridae. It is often seen in shrublands far from any trees, although it does make use of dry woodland along dry and seasonal rivers and farmyards. It is a frequent visitor to our farm nursery, where the birds forage on branches and among foliage in the canopy of trees and among the shrubs and vegetable plants. The birds hop about and hang upside down to glean items out of crevices in bark and twigs, calling often while doing so.</p><p>Grey Tits break open thorns to extract insect larvae, and peck at the dry seed heads of mesembryanthemums to hunt for seed parasites. In 2009 an unusual rain event stimulated the growth of a parasitic gall-forming fungus on Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo trees in the Prince Albert area. By 2011 many of the galls had been colonised by small wasps who, presumably, laid eggs in the galls. The Grey Tits were quick to exploit this opportunity, spending much of their foraging time systematically tapping galls to test for the presence of larvae. Much of their food is lepidopteran larvae, but they also feed opportunistically on the alates of Pugnacious Ant Anoplolepis steingroeveri and Harvester Ant Messor capensis. Small fruits, for example those of honey-thorns (Lycium) also are eaten. Some food items, such as small caterpillars are first beaten against a stone and then swallowed whole, but larger items, such as caterpillars 30–40 mm long, are first bashed, then held down between one foot and a perch, and eaten in chunks.</p><p>Grey Tits break open thorns to extract insect larvae, and peck at the dry seed heads of mesembryanthemums to hunt for seed parasites.

The birds roost alone in cavities in trees and stone walls, and in steel pipes such as those supporting farm gates. The pre-roosting behaviour is similar to that of the Southern Black Tit; the birds spend a minute or two calling near the roost site, then suddenly stop and dart into the roost. Roost sites may become nest sites. At Tierberg, near Prince Albert, a Grey Tit roosted in a hole in a dry stone wall in late July, and in August a pair of Grey Tits was seen prospecting for a nest site, at and around the roost site. By early September the pair had decided on a cavity adjacent to the roost site and started building the nest, bringing feathers, lumps of sheep’s wool, hair (mine, from outdoor haircuts) and soft plant material. Two weeks later, the female was incubating, but not consistently, and one week later was sitting tight in the nest, and being fed by the male every 15 to 20 minutes. The male would arrive at the site and call, the female would then emerge from the nest, quiver her wings like a young bird, and receive the food. Both parents fed the nestlings when they hatched after about 12 days of incubation. The female frequently solicited food from the male, usually unsuccessfully, while both were attending the young. The resident Common Fiscal had also been monitoring this particular nest, and as the first fledgling emerged from the nest cavity, it was taken by the shrike. A sad end to what otherwise would have been something of a nesting success – all the eggs hatched, and all the nestlings survived to leave the nest. The fate of the remainder of the nestlings was not determined.</p>",

It is usually encountered in pairs or small family groups, feeding on the ground, or perched on grass stems, but birds occasionally forage in the tree canopy, where flowers, nectar, termites and other small insects are eaten. The sexes are alike in plumage, and members of a pair perform regular greeting ceremonies when they meet, bowing and undertaking ritualised bill-wiping on their perch; they also frequently allopreen. They sometimes bathe in water that has collected on the foliage, and are regular visitors to garden birdbaths.</p><p>In aggressive interactions, birds face each other with their bodies horizontal. Spreading the tail seems to be a signal of dominance. Male Grey Waxbills fly about conspicuously when courting, carrying a grass stem in their bills. This is followed by perched displays with the body horizontal and swung from side to side accompanied by the whistling song, before initiating the bobbing display common to many waxbills: The male sings while bobbing, still carrying his grass stem, whereas the female is silent. Allopreening always appears to precede copulation.</p><p>In aggressive interactions, birds face each other with their bodies horizontal. Spreading the tail seems to be a signal of dominance.

It is a ball of grass with a tubular side entrance, placed more than 1.5 m above the ground in a shrub or tree. Nests are sometimes placed near the nests of paper wasps, which are notorious for attacking anything that brushes against their nest, and could be important allies for small and largely defenceless birds. It has also been suggested that both wasps and waxbills place their nests at sites which are free of predatory ants, which threaten the brood of both bird and insect; then the association would be incidental rather than deliberate. In addition to building their own nests, Grey Waxbills also frequently use an unoccupied weaver nest (in particular Dark-backed, Spectacled or Village Weavers). Both their own nests and the second-hand weaver nests are lined with fine grass seed heads. It is perhaps surprising that more small birds do not take advantage of the many soundly built yet unused weaver nests that are available each season. In captive birds, the number of eggs laid varies according to the availability of insect food, so it is likely that the breeding success of wild birds is influenced by the availability of insect prey. Both sexes incubate the eggs, brood and feed the nestlings. The young birds beg with the head raised straight up, not twisted around as in most other waxbills. After the young have fledged, they may continue to return to the nest at night to roost there.</p>",

In the same areas, Red-winged Francolins, which are less tolerant of grazing, frequent sites with longer, rank grass on deeper, sedimentary soil.</p><p>Grey-winged Francolins are sedentary and territorial, with non-breeding coveys of 4-20 individuals comprising adults and offspring from the previous breeding season. They usually sit tight if disturbed, but will run if the cover is sparse. They seldom fly, except when flushed and when flying to their overnight roost site. Covey members roost on open ground, huddling together.</p><p>They have a high-pitched, whistling advertisement call ‘pip-pip-pip-pip pi-pip wi-pleeu’, most often given at sunrise, or by individuals when regrouping after disturbance. The ‘wi-pleeu’ phrase is repeated and is sometimes punctuated by another bird giving a ‘pipeeu’ call. The flush call is a frantic ‘pre-pre-pre-pre-preeu-preeu-preeu-preeu’. The number of coveys calling at sunrise can be used as an index of the number of coveys present at different sites during the same season, or between years at the same site. The best time to do these counts is during autumn.</p><p>During winter their diet consists of corms, rhizomes and bulbs of small sedges and irises. During the chick-rearing period they switch to eating invertebrates. Seeds are also an important part of the autumn diet.</p><p>Although breeding peaks during spring, the breeding season is prolonged (August to March) in the summer rainfall grasslands and shorter (July to December) in the winter rainfall areas of the Western Cape. The nest, which is difficult to find, is a scrape in the ground under a grass tuft, lined with grass and feathers. Searching where single birds flush is more effective than using pointing dogs to locate nests. It is uncanny how the incubating hen seems to have no scent available for dogs to locate. The clutch of 5-6 eggs is incubated for 21 or 22 days by the female, with the male guarding nearby. More than one successful clutch per pair per season is unlikely, because parents stay with their chicks throughout the breeding season, and there are no records of one pair of adults accompanied by chicks of different ages. However, the extended breeding season in the summer rainfall region allows for successful re-nesting after the failure of a first clutch, resulting in a second flurry of nesting in late summer. Chicks are precocial, running and feeding soon after hatching. They have highly camouflaged, striped downy plumage for the first three weeks, followed by a ‘scruffy’ stage as the flight feathers grow. They attain near-adult plumage after about seven weeks.</p><p>Nest predation by Yellow Mongoose Cynictis penicillata, crows, and Common Egg-eaters Dasypeltis scabra is common. Other causes of nest failure are destruction by fires and trampling by livestock. A patchy fire mosaic favours these francolins, but grasslands in the summer rainfall region should be burnt before the end of August. Grey-winged Francolins have provided excellent sport shooting in the Eastern Cape for the past century and a sustainable hunting industry now provides a strong incentive for conservation of these grasslands.</p>",

If disturbed while foraging they fly up into the nearest tree and land on a branch near the top, looking around to see what had alarmed them. If there is no obvious danger the birds will fly back down to the ground to continue foraging. It is interesting that when they land they invariably close their wings and then seem to refold them as though they had not folded them comfortably the first time. Although they may be quite shy in the woodlands, in our gardens they became incredibly tame and fed all over the garden, even close to someone actually gardening, picking up earthworms or other insects which were uncovered by a fork or spade.</p><p>They have a variety of calls, at least one of which is a clear whistled ‘sweet-sweet-whip-whip’ from which the scientific name of litsitsirupa is derived. In spring the birds call from near the top of a tree for what appears to be hours at a time. The call has a variety of different notes and it is only the four-note signature call of this bird which identifies it immediately.</p><p>The birds build a large cup-shaped nest in the fork of a tree, usually at no great height above the ground. Nests were built in places that the bird could reach by walking down a branch after landing in the canopy. After visiting to feed the chicks, however, the bird always flew directly away from the nest. Nests are constructed of a variety of thin twigs, bits of grass root and leaf petioles; quite often bits of rag or other man-made articles are incorporated into the outside wall. Both adults participate in building the nest and are equally diligent at feeding the chicks.</p><p>This is one of the woodland species which sometimes has helpers to feed the chicks. One helper is usual, but at least one nest I observed had two helpers. Helpers probably enable the birds to fledge chicks more easily because they usually laid three eggs, and three large chicks required an enormous amount of food to keep them growing well.</p><p>In the nests that I photographed, all of the three chicks were roughly the same size and  feathering stage, which suggested that they had indeed all hatched on the same day. Quite often before the chicks could fly, they would move off the nest to sit in the branches in the canopy above, from whence they could call to the adults bringing food.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a rather out-of-the-ordinary bird, being one of only three truly terrestrial woodpeckers in the world (the other two live in South America). At roughly the size of a Red-winged Starling, it is the largest of all African woodpeckers, and its general colouration is markedly different from all other family members. Aside from the rosy pink of its rump and lower chest, the predominant plumage colours have evolved to match the rocks and boulders on which these birds spend some two thirds of the daylight hours. Given their cryptic colouration and the mountainside scale of their preferred habitat, they can be challenging birds to spot. The best way to locate their position is to listen for the skirling ‘wee-chik’ call.</p><p>They occur in family groups, usually of three to six birds, comprising an adult pair and progeny from the last breeding season. This grouping endures until the onset of the next breeding season, when the young birds commonly form their own groups. Eggs are laid in unlined chambers at the ends of tunnels up to a metre long, usually in earthen banks. The same or similar tunnels are used for roosting throughout the year.</p><p>They occur in family groups, usually of three to six birds, comprising an adult pair and progeny from the last breeding season. This grouping endures until the onset of the next breeding season, when the young birds commonly form their own groups. Eggs are laid in unlined chambers at the ends of tunnels up to a metre long, usually in earthen banks. The same or similar tunnels are used for roosting throughout the year.</p><p>Ground Woodpeckers have long, sticky tongues used for catching ants, but they do not glean ants found walking about on the surface of the ground. Their sought-after fare is protein-rich ant brood (eggs and pupae), usually guarded in the depth of ant nests beyond the reach of prying tongues. But such broods need warmth, and many ants bring their brood up to the underside of surface stones which are warmed by the sun. The woodpeckers know this and probe every crack or hole around embedded stones and, when they find a brood, feast well – the stomach of a road-killed bird contained 1&#160;420 ant eggs as well as numerous cocoons and the bodies of worker ants of six different species (collateral casualties of brood-raiding sorties). Interestingly these woodpeckers don’t eat termites; the rare remains of termite workers or beetles found in their droppings are presumably accidentally ingested.</p><p>The Ground Woodpecker’s specialised method of feeding carries risk because the feeding individual is head down, its tongue rapidly mopping up ant broods before the workers can carry them all down beyond reach. The bird cannot afford to raise its head at intervals to look around, as most other ground-feeding birds do. But the woodpeckers have minimised this risk by having a lookout perched on the highest nearby vantage point while the rest of the group (or the bird’s mate) is foraging on the ground. The bird on sentry duty is commonly relieved at 10-minute intervals, the relieving bird wiping its beak vigorously before settling down for its shift. Such behaviour has not been recorded for any other woodpecker.</p><p>Groups are able to find their fill of food in about one third of the daylight hours, so what else do they do? They spend an inordinate amount of time doing nothing but resting and sungazing, especially during mid-morning and afternoon, when they squat or lie on favoured boulders. However, the birds are not as dozy as they seem; closer scrutiny reveals constant vigilance, especially for anything moving in the sky. The favoured siesta boulder usually offers underside hollows into which the birds can bolt if danger threatens from above.</p><p>This woodpecker was originally thought to be an ancient species because in its habits and appearance it is so very different from all other African woodpeckers. It is not an ancestral pre-woodpecker because it has all the specialised adaptations that woodpeckers have evolved, so it must have descended from tree-dwelling ancestors. Aspects of its ecology and behaviour suggest that it evolved in cooler temperatures than are currently normal because one of its characteristics is that it is easily heat-stressed. When loafing, birds face the sun (thus presenting minimal surface area to the heating rays) and seek shade or a bath when it gets too warm. They are thus often to be found near water, be it a stream or farm water tank, and they drink frequently. Progressive global warming does not, therefore, bode well for the future of this unique woodpecker.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Hadeda Ibis is a familiar bird across much of South Africa and its range has expanded remarkably here in the last half-century, having extended westwards from the eastern side of the country through the eastern and southern Cape into the Western Cape; as recently as 1980 it was an unknown bird on the Cape Peninsula whereas today it is firmly established there. By contrast, in neighbouring Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, no similar range expansion has occurred and here it remains rather restricted and localised in its occurrence. In South Africa it is familiar as much for its call as for its appearance: unlike other ibises which utter undistinguished wheezy notes, the Hadeda (hence its name) makes a raucous trumpeting ha, ha, haahaaaaa and it utters this relentlessly from dawn to dusk; sometimes to announce a fly-past, sometimes to voice its displeasure at being disturbed while feeding, sometimes simply to connect with a second bird. One always knows when there are Hadedas around.</p><p>The explanation given for the bird’s range expansion is changing habitat, and specifically the expansion of irrigation farming into semi-arid areas. This has provided Hadeda Ibises with ever-more moist ground, their favoured foraging substrate. Furthermore, trees have been established in many former treeless areas and these provide the birds with their required roosting and nesting sites. Watered lawns, parks, and playing fields in suburban gardens, have drawn the birds into the heart of towns and cities and today they are as familiar in a garden in Johannesburg, East London or Cape Town as, say, is a thrush, dove or wagtail, providing a familiar sight as they walk about with a proprietary air, often dismissive of people or family pets, probing the ground here and there with their curved bill and once in a while coming up with a cricket, earthworm, weevil or some other garden pest.</p><p>The explanation given for the bird’s range expansion is changing habitat, and specifically the expansion of irrigation farming into semi-arid areas.

Pairs nest solitarily and once established at a safe site, they may use the same spot in successive years. The site is typically on a lateral branch in a large tree, and if it hangs over water, so much the better. The nest is loosely put together in a week or two, a saucer-shaped platform of sticks and twigs, built by one bird gathering the nest material and the other placing it. It is a process that continues through the incubation and some nests have more fallen sticks on the ground below than in the nest itself. Three eggs form the typical clutch and these are laid at 1-2 day intervals. Incubation begins with the first-laid egg and the pair shares this, with shift changes taking place every couple of hours. In contrast to their usual behaviour, the pair seldom makes a noise during changeovers, and their presence while nesting can easily go unnoticed.</p><p>What often gives the presence of a nest away, especially once the eggs have hatched, is the steady accumulation of the birds’ droppings on the ground below, a habit that makes them less than welcome in some gardens. To defecate, the bird on the nest simply faces outwards and squirts its faeces over the edge, away from the nest; consequently, nests built above car parks or patios are seldom popular! The incubation lasts for 25-28 days and the discarded eggshells are similarly dropped over the edge, their presence on the ground below usually being the first clue to this event happening. Young Hadedas leave the nest at 5-6 weeks of age, looking much like their parents but having less sheen in the plumage and no red on the bill. They soon link up with others of their kind and quickly pick up their noisy habits to become a part of the raucous Hadeda fraternity.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Half-collared Kingfisher is somewhat larger than the Malachite Kingfisher which often occurs alongside it, and has a longer, thicker, black (not red) bill. It also has a lot more ‘kingfisher blue’ from the top of the head to the tip of the tail. Half-collared Kingfishers are much less common than Malachite Kingfishers and are much shyer than our other waterside kingfishers. Indeed, they are shy enough to be easily overlooked and, as recently as the early 1970s, were not known to occur along the rivers coming off the Zimbabwe watershed. However, they are present on all the perennial rivers there, although in smaller numbers than along rivers in the Cape. They are highly territorial, with each pair defending a section of river which is long enough to provide food throughout the year, especially during the breeding season when a pair may have up to four or even five chicks to feed.</p><p>For hunting, they prefer a perch approximately 1-2 metres above the water. They sit absolutely still on the perch for a long period before moving to another perch, sitting so still that they easily escape detection, despite their bright blue and orange plumage. When they dive into the water they reappear very quickly, suggesting that they do not dive deeply. They often shake water off their plumage just after they emerge, giving the whole body a good shake. Although fish are their most important food, they occasionally eat crabs and insects. They almost certainly also eat frogs.</p><p>For hunting, they prefer a perch approximately 1-2 metres above the water.

Although fish are their most important food, they occasionally eat crabs and insects. They almost certainly also eat frogs.</p><p>The Half-collared Kingfisher is even more particular than the Malachite Kingfisher in selecting the bank in which to build its nesting burrow. The birds seek out banks which are over water and ideally have grass or other vegetation along the top of the bank, often in the form of an overhanging fringe. This vegetation protects the top of the bank from rain erosion. This makes the nest very difficult to see, even from a canoe, and also undoubtedly helps to protect the bird from predators such as snakes. Breeding usually starts once water levels stabilise in spring in South Africa, or autumn in Zimbabwe, but it has been recorded breeding in all months from July to March.</p><p>When approaching the nest with food for the chicks, the adult usually stops on a perch from which it can survey the nest surrounds for danger. It is noticeable that the fish for the chicks is carried head outwards so that it will be fed to the chick head first. This is essential so that the spines of the fish do not catch in the chicks’ throat. The indigestible spines and skeleton are regurgitated as a pellet by the chick.</p><p>When the young leave the nest, they have a dusky bill and bright blue spots on a darker plumage. The bill looks much too large for the bird! The young stay within the parents’ stretch of river and are fed by the parents for some weeks after leaving the nest. Subsequently they are driven out of the parental territory, especially if the parents decide to nest a second time (which is the norm). The same nest will be used again and again until the bank is destroyed by floods. This multiple use sometimes results in the nest becoming infested with mites, which probably feed on the chicks. Certainly, if one puts one’s hand at the entrance to the nest, these mites crawl rapidly onto it!  When the adult emerges from the nest it dives into the water nearby and then flies up to a perch to preen. This process is repeated until it has cleared its plumage of mites.&#9;</p>",

It shows some similarities to both herons and storks, and family trees derived from DNA data provide some support for these relationships, with one study suggesting that the Hamerkop shares a common ancestry with the Shoebill Balaeniceps rex.</p><p>In terms of their foraging behaviour, Hamerkops are best described as generalists, because they can turn their beaks to just about anything. They eat mostly frogs and toads, and their tadpoles, but also include fish, invertebrates and small mammals in their diet. In shallow water they move their feet about to flush hiding prey, and they are adept at snatching surfacing tadpoles or fish in flight.</p><p>In terms of their foraging behaviour, Hamerkops are best described as generalists, because they can turn their beaks to just about anything.

In shallow water they move their feet about to flush hiding prey, and they are adept at snatching surfacing tadpoles or fish in flight.</p><p>Aggregations of Hamerkops (usually family groups) often indulge in a wide range of noisy displays, including one in which a bird stands on another’s back. This is termed ‘false mounting’ in ornithological jargon, but ‘stacking’ is more descriptive, especially when three or even four birds are involved.</p><p>Strange appearance and odd displays aside, one of the features that define the uniqueness of the Hamerkop is its remarkable nest. This huge structure, up to 2 metres in diameter and 1–2 metres high, is typically situated in a large tree or, in areas where big trees are scarce, on an elevated rock ledge or boulder. It is constructed from reeds, corn stalks, and sticks (up to 65 cm long and 56 g in weight), contains a mud-lined, 80 cm diameter chamber with a similarly mud-lined, downward-sloping entrance hole. The entrance is just big enough for adult passage and requires adroit flight because the bird has to fly upwards to the entrance with enough speed to close its wings and enter like a projectile. The whole edifice can weigh up to 50 kg. The roof alone can be up to a metre thick and will support the weight of a man. Building activity by both male and female takes place mainly during early morning and late afternoon, and nest construction commonly takes about 40 days. The same nest may be reused for several years, unless appropriated by other animals such as monitor lizards, pythons, Egyptian Geese, Barn Owls or bees.</p><p>Perhaps the most unusual Hamerkop habit (and one for which nobody has yet offered an explanation), is the scrounging of people’s personal effects to adorn the nest. These include throwaways such as old bicycle tyres, enamel pots, old socks and cast-off underwear; and blowaways such as newspaper, tinfoil and packaging. These items are collected by a breeding pair and placed on top of the nest roof. If the surrounding area is litter-free, the Hamerkops may visit the nearest homestead washing line to purloin small items of children’s clothing or lacy lingerie, and they have a penchant for blue-coloured material.</p><p>Their weird habit of collecting discarded items and garments to decorate the top of the nest may be the reason why Hamerkops are considered birds of ill omen in African culture and superstition. Obtaining an item of somebody’s clothing is believed to enable witchcraft practitioners to afflict illness or misfortune upon that individual. If a Hamerkop should be killed, various dire consequences are certain to follow – violent storms and floods will sweep away houses. Superstition also has it that if a Hamerkop alights on one’s roof, lightning will subsequently strike there or kill the cattle. Whatever the belief, the awe in which these birds are held ensures that neither they nor their huge nests are ever targeted by hunters.</p>",

The only extensive overlap with Common Quail is in South Africa and northern Namibia. Where they are found with Blue Quail in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, Blue Quail are rare and generally confined to damp and flooded grasslands in lightly wooded areas. They are secretive, staying concealed within cover and are reluctant to flush, preferring to sit tight until approached and then bursting into fast, low flight before dropping back into cover. Their presence is often only disclosed by their monotonously repeated call, similar to that of the Common Quail but a more deliberate ‘wit, wit, wit’, with a harsher, metallic quality. Calling males stand erect, displaying their chestnut underparts and distinct throat pattern. Most calling is during the morning and late afternoon, and after rain or when a storm is looming. The flush call is a squeaky ‘kree-kree-kree’.</p><p>More gregarious than Common Quail, Harlequin Quails are often found in coveys of 6-20 individuals in the non-breeding season. During the migration period they aggregate in large flocks, and adults are often killed by cars, or by flying into the windows of buildings.</p><p>Their winter diet includes grass, weed and agricultural crop seeds, such as goose grass, bristle grasses and sorghum. The summer diet is supplemented with grasshoppers, caterpillars, termites, ants, beetles and small molluscs. They usually forage within cover, but sometimes in the open at the edges of roads.</p><p>The breeding season varies across southern Africa, linked to heavy rainfall. They breed throughout the summer (October to March, peak December and January) in South Africa; during late summer to early winter (January to July, peak February) in Namibia; and in October to June (peak January and February) in Zimbabwe. Unlike most gamebirds, Harlequin Quails sometimes nest in loose colonies, and males may mate with more than one female. When breeding, males fiercely defend the nesting territory against any intruder and respond readily to taped calls. The nest is a small bowl with sparse lining, usually in grasslands with well-spaced grass tufts, or weedy fields. The clutch is 4-8 eggs, occasionally up to 20, with large clutches probably laid by more than one hen. Incubation by the female lasts 14-18 days. The chicks can flutter-fly at 9 days, and fly well at 4 weeks. Adults feign injury to distract predators while the chicks scatter and squat to avoid detection.</p><p>Although locally abundant in some years, their status is uncertain, and a better understanding is needed of their overall movements and requirements. This attractive little quail is favoured by aviculturists.</p>",

Although this is a territorial advertisement, it is often heard when the flock mobs a snake or other predator, and this has led the local baTswana people who share its range around the Okavango to call it Letsheganoga – the one which laughs at snakes!</p><p>Hartlaub’s Babbler is semi-terrestrial, and the small flocks (usually 8-10 birds) can be seen hopping on the ground or foraging low down in the undergrowth, rather like thrushes (the generic name Turdoides means ‘thrush-like’). A close look will show the scaled appearance to the feathers on the head, neck and mantle, which differentiates this species from the co-occurring Arrow-marked Babbler, with which it frequently forages. The best field characteristic, however, is the white rump – in this respect the Afrikaans name and the previously used English name, White-rumped Babbler, are very apt. However, the latter name is now reserved for Turdoides leucopygia, which is endemic to north-east Africa.</p><p>The social organisation of this species is fascinating, as the groups are quite stable and occupy a permanent territory which they defend collectively against neighbouring flocks, with raucous calling and ritualised posturing. This group territoriality is a common feature of birds which are co-operative breeders, and consequently it is not surprising that in this species, helpers of both sexes assist the dominant pair with nest-building, brooding and feeding of the young. Hartlaub’s Babbler may be a rare example of an obligate co-operative breeder because, unlike Southern Pied Babbler, pairs are not known to breed solitarily. The flocks are almost certainly family groups, with the helpers being related to the breeding pair and thus sharing much of their genetic make-up with the new brood. However, relatedness within flocks is not proven and further research is needed to clarify this aspect, and also to determine the incubation period for this species, which is currently unrecorded.</p><p>Some aspects of the breeding biology of Hartlaub’s Babbler can be inferred from what is known about its five southern African congeners – for example, in common with three of them, it is known to be parasitised by Levaillant’s Cuckoo. It is not clear why the eggs of this species (and other babblers) are conspicuously bright, glossy blue, as this does not seem to reduce parasitism by the cuckoo, which lays a matching blue egg. Judging by the number of flocks accompanied by a large, voracious cuckoo chick during summer, a significant proportion of Hartlaub’s Babbler nests are parasitised, but early-breeding birds, which commence nesting before the return of the cuckoos at the onset of summer, escape this scourge.</p><p>The diet of Hartlaub’s Babbler is not well known but, based on studies of its close relatives, it is suspected to feed on a range of invertebrates and fruit, and possibly small reptiles. This is another area for useful research, and birders in northern Botswana and Namibia, who see this species daily and perhaps take it for granted, could make a real contribution towards improving our knowledge by documenting their observations.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Hartlaub’s Gull is endemic to southern Africa, with an historical breeding range extending along the coast from Namibia to Cape Agulhas: it is particularly common around the south-western Cape from Cape Town north to Lambert’s Bay, and on the central Namibian coast. More recently, it has expanded its range eastwards to Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, but unlike west coast birds it has ignored offshore islands as potential breeding sites and instead has established a small population on salt pans along the Swartkops River near Port Elizabeth. There has also been vagrancy as far east as Lake St Lucia in KwaZulu-Natal, but the origin of these birds is not known. In the vicinity of Cape Town birds have moved up to 50 km inland to utilise man-made lakes and sewage ponds.</p><p>This is a colonially nesting species that forms fairly compact colonies, often in association with Swift Terns, and Grey-headed and Kelp Gulls. When breeding with Swift Terns they normally nest on the periphery of the colony because the tern is the dominant bird, and the terns nest too close together for the comfort of the gull. On Dyer Island in the Western Cape they often breed along a garden wall surrounding the main dwelling. In choosing this as a nest site, they probably obtain a degree of protection from the ever-present Kelp Gulls which prey on their eggs and young.  Swift Terns, nesting adjacent to the wall with their large numbers, probably act as an additional deterrent to the Kelp Gulls. Colony breeding site fidelity is generally very low, and individuals often show low fidelity to their natal colony. Within a colony, adults are territorial and spend much time displaying aggressively towards each other. Because numbers of breeding birds tend to fluctuate from year to year, it has been suggested that not all birds breed each year, as is the case in some tern species. This makes it difficult to gauge the overall size of the breeding population. This species hybridises extensively with Grey-headed Gulls, especially in central Namibia, the south-western Cape and the Eastern Cape.</p><p>This is a colonially nesting species that forms fairly compact colonies, often in association with Swift Terns, and Grey-headed and Kelp Gulls.

This makes it difficult to gauge the overall size of the breeding population. This species hybridises extensively with Grey-headed Gulls, especially in central Namibia, the south-western Cape and the Eastern Cape.</p><p>Generally Hartlaub’s Gulls are fairly sedentary, with ring recoveries of chicks showing that few move more than 30 km away from site of ringing. The longest movement to date was of a bird rehabilitated after oiling at Lüderitz and found in a healthy condition about 420 km north a few months later at Walvis Bay.</p><p>In common with most coastal gulls this species eats a wide range of food types and is truly an opportunistic forager. Natural feeding occurs offshore where birds snatch prey from the water surface or when plunge-diving. In estuaries, groups of Hartlaub’s Gulls co-operate in driving fish into the shallows where they are more easily caught. They also forage along the shoreline, especially on receding tides, scavenging morsels left behind. Fishing ports are regularly exploited for discarded fragments of fish, the gulls sometimes competing with terns for this largesse. Their association with man, however, has led them to spend much time at rubbish dumps, where any types of man-discarded food may be consumed. They also regularly visit fast-food outlets where they beg for any scraps such as fish, chips and bread. On the breeding islands they frequent colonies of birds such as cormorants where they quickly dispose of any discarded food items. They also follow ploughs, feeding on earthworms, and hawk emerging termite alates. Hartlaub’s Gulls also steal food from cormorants and terns and are themselves kleptoparasitised by both Kelp Gulls and Parasitic Jaegers.</p>",

They and Coqui Francolin are the only two southern African spurfowls and francolins in which males and females differ markedly in their appearance.</p><p>This near-endemic species has a scattered distribution in central and northern Namibia, particularly on the Namibian escarpment, from Windhoek north to the Kunene River and east to Grootfontein. It is one of southern Africa’s more habitat-specific gamebirds, being confined largely to granite and sandstone boulder outcrops on sandy soils, surrounded by arid woodlands. The vegetation in and around these outcrops is invariably dense grass and scrub, with heavy undergrowth. Because they are so specialised in their choice of habitat, local populations fluctuate during droughts or due to overgrazing, but distribution patterns have not changed to any large degree in recent times.</p><p>This near-endemic species has a scattered distribution in central and northern Namibia, particularly on the Namibian escarpment, from Windhoek north to the Kunene River and east to Grootfontein.

The vegetation in and around these outcrops is invariably dense grass and scrub, with heavy undergrowth. Because they are so specialised in their choice of habitat, local populations fluctuate during droughts or due to overgrazing, but distribution patterns have not changed to any large degree in recent times.</p><p>They are highly territorial and not easily flushed, preferring to seek refuge in gaps between boulders. When flushed, they fly fast, often uttering a rapid, chattering ‘krak’. Pairs scrambling about boulder-strewn slopes are difficult to observe as they dart between rocks and amongst vegetation. They are unusual among spurfowls in that they tend to maintain a strong pair bond throughout the year. Both partners help to advertise and demarcate the territory with a complex, raucous duet initiated by the female. This behaviour leads to another interesting difference between this small spurfowl and other gamebirds. Conflicts between individuals are not resolved by physical confrontation, but rather by call contests and postural displays. It is probably for this reason that they respond readily to playback recordings, which seldom happen with other spurfowls.</p><p>Although most spurfowls perform courtship displays, the elaborate courting ritual of Hartlaub’s Spurfowl is especially striking. During the courtship dance, the male calls quietly as he approaches the female, slowly raising and lowering his tail and fanning it to show his prominent black-and-white tail feathers. He also sways to and fro, bows his body and wings, and continuously bobs his head. An accepting vocal response from the female elicits increased intensity of the male’s display, and he might begin bobbing his body, fanning his tail widely and calling provocatively. The bond thus created, the two keep their bodies and wings lowered and continue their dance. Thereafter the bond is maintained by interactive vocal contact. The daily advertisement calls, typically starting just before sunrise, comprise a closely synchronised duet by the male and female alternating rapidly, ‘wiich ter wideo, wiich ter wideo, wiich ter wideo…’ This spectacular and intricate vocal routine is highly ventriloquial, leaving the listener none the wiser as to the location of the birds.</p><p>They eat corms and rhizomes of small sedges, a variety of bulbs, seeds and fruits, as well as invertebrates, including beetles, grubs, larvae and snails. The pair ventures from the security of boulder outcrops to feed in openings adjacent to their refuge. The powerful bill is used to scrape out the corms and bulbs, and large areas of soil can be upturned while feeding.</p><p>Most breeding records are during winter. The nest scrape is well hidden within piles of boulders and is particularly difficult to find. The clutch of only 2-4, normally 3 eggs, is unusually small for an African gamebird. Incubation lasts for 23 days, and it is not known whether the male assists the female. However, the chicks are cared for by the male, which is also unusual in gamebirds. The chicks can flutter-fly at the early age of only three days, and fledge at twelve days. The strong sexual differences in plumage begin to show after three months.</p><p>Their populations may be impacted in areas exposed to severe habitat destruction, particularly by granite mining.</p>",

The only obvious difference between the sexes is that the male performs a characteristic, hump-backed display, walking erect on his toes with wings raised and held close to his body, while females walk flat-footed and appear slouched in posture.</p><p>Helmeted Guineafowls are common in savannas mixed with farmland. They are absent from dry areas in southern Namibia and the Northern Cape which lack drinking water and elevated roosts, but have expanded their range where humans have added these features to the landscape, such as telephone poles. Humans have also expanded their range by releasing captive birds into new areas.

Before 1875, they did not occur south of the Orange River or west of the Eastern Cape.</p><p>Helmeted Guineafowls are common in savannas mixed with farmland.

Unfortunately, some of these were domesticated birds which have white feathers on the wings or body, whitish facial skin and orange legs. Before 1875, they did not occur south of the Orange River or west of the Eastern Cape.</p><p>During winter, they form flocks of up to 40 birds, with groups of hundreds of birds probably being many flocks converging on a special resource. Flocks leave their roost at first light. After drinking, they socialise on their way to an open area with dry, sandy soil where they preen and dust-bathe. After grooming, they move to their favoured feeding areas. At sunset they return to their roost, when they give the characteristic cackling alarm call ‘kek, kek, kek, kek, kaaaaaa, ka, ka, ka, ka, kaaaaaa, ka, ka’.</p><p>They are opportunistic feeders, eating bulbs, plant stems and spillage from harvested grain, grass seeds, and even dubbeltjie seeds, which have prickly thorns. During early summer, they eat insects, including agricultural pests like cutworms, grasshoppers and termites, providing the females with protein for egg production. Although they regularly feed in agricultural areas, they seldom attack growing maize plants or maize cobs still attached to healthy plants.</p><p>As the breeding season approaches pair bonds are established, with males aggressively guarding their mates. Males forego feeding, engaging instead in courtship feeding, catching and dropping prey in front of their mate while assuming the hump-backed display and uttering a soft ‘chip, chip, cheree’ call. The female has a distinctive two-note ‘buck-wheat’ contact call in the breeding season.</p><p>Breeding is during summer in South Africa, and during late summer and early autumn in Botswana and Namibia, triggered by heavy rainfall. In the Western Cape, breeding is between September and December, to take advantage of the flush of food that follows the winter rains. The female selects the nesting site in tall grass at the base of a tussock or under a bush. The well-concealed nest scrape is lightly lined with feathers and grass. Six to twenty eggs are laid. The egg shells are among the thickest of all birds’ eggs. The female incubates for 24-27 days and feeds very little during this time. For two weeks after hatching, the male cares for the chicks, while the female regains condition. Without the male, the keets would likely die if not helped with finding insect food, and brooded at night. Parents are aggressive and drive animals such as jackals, baboons and even humans away from their young, with wings arched and spread. By three weeks old, keets can fly up to join their parents at the roost. When the keets have fledged, flocks re-form and broods of young are overseen by adults other than their parents.</p><p>Since the 1980s, populations of Helmeted Guineafowls in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal have declined, largely due to disease, predation by feral carnivores, and snaring and poisoning by humans. Habitat degradation associated with crop farming involving the elimination of weeds and insects with herbicides and insecticides has also destroyed nesting cover and food. Widespread local extinctions in the former Transkei are the result of severe habitat degradation and injudicious hunting.</p>",

It is found across the northern parts of Namibia, through the Zambezi Region and northern Botswana, into the Zambezi Valley. It also occurs down the eastern side of Zimbabwe into the Limpopo and Save valleys, and southwards through the eastern lowveld of South Africa. It is a small, dark brown, almost black bird, with a bare face which is whitish in colour but can flush bright pink when excited, or during aggression.</p><p>The birds are usually the first to take flight in the morning, often before thermals have developed, and generally fly at no great height above the ground. As a result they are often the first vultures to arrive at the carcass but are soon displaced when the bigger vultures arrive. They have been noted eating maggots at old carcasses and have been seen taking out the eyes of animals whose carcasses were not yet open and available to them for feeding. They may be seen joining eagles at termite alate emergences.</p><p>The birds are usually the first to take flight in the morning, often before thermals have developed, and generally fly at no great height above the ground.

They may be seen joining eagles at termite alate emergences.</p><p>Although the Hooded Vulture’s small size results in it being dominated by all the other vultures at carcasses, it has a long, thin bill enabling it to pick out flesh in places too small for the other vultures to access. It also has long legs, and is a nimble and energetic runner. It is fascinating to watch these small vultures at a carcass because they will dart in, grab a small scrap of meat and then move out again while the predators and, later, the vultures are feeding. For example, one has been seen to dart in between the legs of a hyena to grab a scrap of meat. If a bird manages to get a larger chunk of meat it will move away from the crowded carcass to eat it without being harassed by other vultures. Watching this species feeding in the Save River lowveld in Zimbabwe, it was clear that they were prepared to wait patiently until the bulk of the carcass had been consumed and then, when the larger vultures moved away, would move in to feed on all the scraps that were left.</p><p>My most interesting experience of this bird was along the Linyanti River in northern Botswana where they are common and nest in the larger trees along the river line, with nests every 100-150 metres apart. The nest was a small basin-shaped structure placed in a leafy tree such as a Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis. Many of the nests were not particularly high in the tree and we were able to observe a number of these birds either sitting on the edge of their nest, or some sitting in the nest incubating an egg or brooding a small chick. They were not particularly disturbed by our group walking quietly along the river, and did not leave the nest even if we walked under a tree containing a nest.</p><p>We were later to see a number of Hooded Vultures at the carcass of a kudu that had been killed by lions. At the carcass they were, once again, not in the least bit concerned about our group sitting in a vehicle and, unlike the other vultures that kept a good distance from us, would walk right up to the vehicle from time to time.</p><p>This species lays in midwinter and has an incubation period of approximately 50 days, so that there are chicks in the nest in spring.</p>",

It is the only one of the world’s nearly one hundred swift and tree swift species to nest (and roost) in burrows in sandbanks. Unlike the Little and White-rumped Swifts it has not benefited from man’s building activities, though it may have been able to expand its range somewhat by nesting in the banks of erosion dongas, road or rail cuttings, quarries and mine dumps.</p><p>The burrows it uses are those of other hole-nesting birds, usually bee-eaters, starlings, kingfishers and martins. Most of these are larger and therefore unlikely to be evicted from their nests, so the swifts must find vacated burrows. There are a few reports of it possibly excavating its own burrows, but this requires verification; the very short legs and short, weak bill seem ill-adapted for such activity, though existing tunnels might be modified. Evictions have been recorded, however, in White-fronted Bee-eater colonies in Kenya, so they may also occur among these and the other smaller ‘nest host’ species in southern Africa. Observed evictions entailed eggs being pushed out, or nestlings killed by puncturing with the claws, and they occasionally caused ‘major losses’ at the bee-eater colonies. Pied Starlings sometimes usurp burrows occupied by Horus Swifts.</p><p>The burrows it uses are those of other hole-nesting birds, usually bee-eaters, starlings, kingfishers and martins.

Incubation and brood-rearing is shared by the parents. This species might be a co-operative breeder (with ‘helpers’ at the nest) according to a study in which ecological and life-history traits of known co-operative breeders in South Africa were compared with those of poorly-studied species. The sandbanks in which it breeds cannot be considered permanent, but these will obviously vary in their stability. One ringed bird in Zimbabwe was recaptured after 13 years at a colony using White-fronted Bee-eater burrows in an eroded mine dump.</p><p>The recorded diet of this swift is taken on the wing and composed mainly of insects and spiders, though the weevils reported by one observer may have been picked from the foliage of riverine vegetation in the vicinity of the nests.</p><p>This bird’s movements have still to be determined. It appears to be resident in the tropical lowlands of north-eastern South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and is a summer-breeding visitor elsewhere, with such birds possibly moving to lower levels for the winter. The unusual nesting requirements of this swift might have been evolved to release it from competition with the cliff-nesting species. Nevertheless, there will be sites (such as a river bridge with sandbanks nearby) where it can occur alongside the other two white-rumped species. One’s identification skills might be tested here – concentrate on the tail and rump: the White-rumped has a deeply forked tail, often held closed, and narrow white crescent on the rump, the Horus has a shallow-forked tail and broader white rump, extending onto the flanks (but with some birds further north having dark rumps), while the Little Swift is distinctly smaller, has a square tail and an even broader white rump that wraps around the flanks.&#9;</p>",

The habitat of the Hottentot Buttonquail is montane and coastal Fynbos, including strandveld, favouring fairly open vegetation with abundant restios, burnt 2-5 years previously. They are tough to find, and are keenly sought after by birders. Difficult to flush, they only fly a short distance at first, but will fly further if flushed a second time. The Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve within Table Mountain National Park may at times host more than 300 individuals, but at other times one could spend days in the reserve without catching a glimpse of one. They are thought to be largely sedentary, but with some movement over unknown distances. They breed from September to December, with six of the eight nests ever found having been in October. Their call is a deep, flufftail-like hooting, similar to that of the Black-rumped Buttonquail. Although presumably secure in remote mountainous areas, they are pressured by urban development and alien tree invasions in the coastal lowlands.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is our second smallest duck species, being only a few centimetres longer than the Pygmy Goose Nettapus auritus. It is Africa’s lightest duck, with small birds weighing only 200 grams. It is small enough to be overlooked in the wetlands among the emergent vegetation it prefers. Like the Red-billed Teal Anas erythrorhyncha, these ducks have a dark crown, but the cheek is paler than the former species and the bill is blue. The body is speckled with darker spots than those on other similar ducks. In flight the white trailing edge to the wings is conspicuous, but the green speculum is too dark to show clearly unless in bright sunlight.</p><p>Although they are often considered to be sedentary, there is clearly a fair amount of movement, depending on rain. In the Okavango they move out as the swamps dry up and then reappear when the swamps are flooded in June and July. In Zimbabwe they were fairly unusual visitors to the farm dams where I used to go birding. Despite the permanent water levels in many of these dams, this species appeared to be merely a summer visitor to the plateau area.</p><p>Although they are often considered to be sedentary, there is clearly a fair amount of movement, depending on rain.

Despite the permanent water levels in many of these dams, this species appeared to be merely a summer visitor to the plateau area.</p><p>The Hottentot Teal is generally considered to be a tropical or subtropical species so it is not surprising that they are uncommon over most of our region. Although they can turn up almost anywhere outside of the very dry areas, their stronghold in southern Africa is the Okavango Delta. Here the bird is common to locally very common, with large flocks found on some lagoons. Elsewhere they are much less common and appear to be highly nomadic. I have seen them from time to time on pans in the southern Cape, but they do not seem to stay very long, and I have never seen any ducklings here.</p><p>The Hottentot Teal is a quiet, unobtrusive duck which is found in pairs or small flocks in well-vegetated permanent or semi-permanent shallow wetlands. However, they do move onto temporary pans following rain. When approached, the birds prefer swimming away rather than flying off, which is unusual for ducks. They are crepuscular (early-morning and late-evening or twilight) feeders and are probably our least studied duck species. They feed on both animal and vegetable matter, immersing the head while swimming or even walking in shallow water. They eat snails, small frogs and other small animals. They also eat pondweed and grass seed.  The amount of each varies considerably with the place and the season, with animal matter accounting for over 90% in some places and less than 50% in others.</p><p>Although this species has not been studied as well as other dabbling ducks, they behave as typical dabbling ducks when breeding. The female often initiates the courtship by raising the head and moving it backward and forward, and the male then gives chase in a high-speed flight. The female builds a deep, basin-shaped nest in emergent vegetation, or in a tree in water in which dense grass has developed. She adds a lot of brown down to the nest towards the end of egg-laying and only starts incubation once the clutch is complete. The nest is well concealed with only a single hole for access through the emergent vegetation.</p><p>The male is normally in attendance during nest-building and egg-laying but usually disappears once the female starts incubation. However, there are reports of several instances where a male remained to help rear the ducklings.</p>",

Other ship-assisted colonisations have happened at Beira, and Maputo in Mozambique. Currently there are populations in most coastal cities, including Richards Bay, East London and Port Elizabeth.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Though not a domesticated species (as its name implies), the House Sparrow is undoubtedly mankind’s most familiar avian commensal. It has been called ‘a bird of European civilisation’ and its current presence in many parts of the world is indeed a consequence of European influence. The association can be quite striking. In the early 1960s I had cause to visit Molepolole in southern Botswana. Grass huts housed the thousands of Africans who resided there, and that part of the settlement was alive with Cape Sparrows. In sharp contrast, the expatriate government officers lived in a line of white-painted, conventional brick houses, each of which boasted its own family of House Sparrows!</p><p>The first House Sparrows to be introduced into southern Africa were brought to Durban from India in the late 19th century, probably as pets of indentured labourers. They had been introduced to India much earlier and, having developed minor plumage differences, were given the subspecific name Passer domesticus indicus.House Sparrows from Europe were subsequently introduced at East London and at Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) in Mozambique, but the burgeoning KwaZulu-Natal sparrow population quickly absorbed these more recent immigrants. The Indian sparrows, adapted as they were to the tropical Asian climate, have made the most of conditions in southern Africa. By the late 1940s they had spread as far as Johannesburg and they are now found throughout the region.</p><p>The first House Sparrows to be introduced into southern Africa were brought to Durban from India in the late 19th century, probably as pets of indentured labourers.

By the late 1940s they had spread as far as Johannesburg and they are now found throughout the region.</p><p>In spite of the widespread belief that all alien species pose a threat to indigenous wildlife, no species of birds are significantly disadvantaged by the presence of House Sparrows. Unlike its African relatives, it nests only in or around permanent buildings. Other small birds such as swallows and martins, that also use buildings as breeding sites may have their nests usurped, but they are not ‘driven away’ by the sparrows. House Sparrows expand their range by way of transport routes, and their ability to eke out a living in urban and industrial surroundings that are virtually devoid of natural resources undoubtedly contributes to their success.</p><p>House Sparrows certainly hold their own at the bird table (even against male Pin-tailed Whydahs), but their pugnacity is mainly directed against their own kind. A shouting match will suddenly erupt between two birds (not always males) and every House Sparrow within sight or hearing will come rushing, like children in a school playground, to join what quickly becomes a very rowdy spat among the participants. Such disputes end as abruptly as they began, with combatants seldom suffering serious injury.</p><p>Given adequate food supplies, House Sparrows breed throughout the year, and they are devoted parents to their nondescript fledglings. The males with the darkest and largest black bibs are supposed to be the dominant birds – those at the top of the peck order – but it isn’t always the case. In industrial areas these sparrows can get pretty grimy: indeed, few birds better epitomise the environmental impact of industrial development than unkempt, soot-besmirched House Sparrows. In early 20th Century England, dirty sparrows were the norm rather than the exception, prompting the author of a leading reference work to comment: “when clean, the cock sparrow is an exceedingly handsome bird”.</p><p>House Sparrows are also smart and very opportunistic. One enterprising colony of these birds took up residence in a town supermarket in which they enjoyed both shelter and a superabundance of quality foods. They habituated to shoppers without permitting too close an approach, and in all probability many shoppers were delighted by their close in-store encounters with these cheeky little birds. The birds left the premises during peak holiday periods when the store became too busy for their liking.&#9;</p>",

The Yellow-billed Egret is the second-largest in the line-up, intermediate in size between the Great and the Little Egret. Its scientific name is based on this feature, and it is known as the Intermediate Egret in parts of its range. Size differences are deceptive, and unless one sees Great and Yellow-billed Egrets standing side by side, it is easy to misjudge this: both have all-white plumages, long, slender necks, dark legs and, in Great Egrets outside the breeding season, similarly-coloured bills. In these circumstances the important identification details to check are the leg colour and specifically the colour of the tibia, i.e. the upper part of the leg, above the ‘knee’ (which is actually the bird’s ankle) – this is yellow in Yellow-billed Egrets, giving it a two-tone leg, and black in Great Egrets, giving it an entirely black leg. Secondly, the Yellow-billed Egret lacks the black line running from the bill back below the eye which is conspicuous on the Great Egret. When the birds are wading in flooded grass their legs are not always visible and one then relies on the length of the bill and neck which in the Great Egret are substantially longer, proportionate to body size, than in the Yellow-billed Egret.</p><p>Yellow-billed Egrets are entirely aquatic in their habits and they favour recently flooded areas where scattered individuals may often be seen dotted across a wetland, each working a patch for frogs, small fish and aquatic or stranded insects. They also fish by wading in open shallow water, though they do not practise this as extensively as Great and Little Egrets do. Unlike those species, they normally hunt solitarily, not routinely gathering in numbers at a feeding site. Prey may be ambushed from a stand-and-wait position or it may be stalked by slowly walking forward, sometimes followed by a brief chase.</p><p>Yellow-billed Egrets are entirely aquatic in their habits and they favour recently flooded areas where scattered individuals may often be seen dotted across a wetland, each working a patch for frogs, small fish and aquatic or stranded insects.

In range and preferred habitat it has much in common with the smaller Squacco Heron and although the latter bird doesn’t normally extend into the Western Cape, elsewhere where Squacco Herons occur, Yellow-billed Egrets are often nearby. There is no evidence that Yellow-billed Egrets are migratory, but they do undertake local movements, and quickly find and colonise temporarily flooded areas. They can be present in numbers at such sites for many months and then disappear as the habitat becomes unsuitable, and may not be seen there again for a year, or years, until the next flooding event. How extensive their movements are is uncertain but there is a recovery on record of a nestling ringed in the Western Cape being recovered in Zambia, and other nestlings ringed on the Witwatersrand have been recovered up to 150 km from their birth site.</p><p>Yellow-billed Egrets breed in summer, and they invariably nest colonially, usually amidst a mass of other breeding herons, ibises, cormorants and other species in large mixed-species heronries. These sites are invariably over water and are commonly located deep within large, impenetrable reed beds; less often used are trees standing in water. Prior to egg-laying both sexes develop elongated filament-like plumes on their back and neck and, briefly, the bill and tibia become blood-red and the lores change from yellow to lime-green. In common with other herons and egrets the male collects nesting material and he brings this to the waiting female who constructs the simple nest platform. Two or three eggs are laid and the sexes share in their incubation, changing over at intervals.</p>",

Without going into too much detail, but starting with Austin Roberts who was an entrenched splitter, his 1940 book The Birds of South Africa, listed them as two species. In subsequent authoritative books in 1957, 1962, 1967, 1970 and 1978 they were lumped, but again split in 1980, then lumped in 1982, then split again in the later revisions of Roberts in 1985, 1993, and 2005.</p><p>At first glance one may wonder how the two, one with an all-white front, the other with a black-and-rufous front, could be considered to be the same species.

Like most species of buzzards they are rather sluggish hunters, scanning the ground from high vantage points and swooping down when prey is sighted. They are especially numerous in mountainous and hilly country, and are often seen hunting in such areas by riding the crest of a hill in almost motionless flight, using the updraft to maintain their height with little more than a flicker of the tips of the wings to show they are flying.</p><p>The bulk of the Jackal Buzzard’s diet is comprised of small mammals, especially rodents, but larger prey, including hares, mongooses and young hyrax are caught when the opportunity arises. Birds and reptiles are also hunted and these include gamebirds, doves and pigeons, with a few surprising inclusions such as Black-shouldered Kite: unless the kite was injured it is hard to imagine how such an agile little hawk could fall prey to a ponderous hunter like the buzzard. They also scavenge at carcasses and feed, for example, on sheep placentas during the lambing season.</p><p>Breeding commences in late winter with nest repair. Both sexes collect and add branches, and they usually return to a previously-used nest rather than build a new one. The nest is usually situated on a sheltered ledge in a recess in the upper third of a cliff face. In Lesotho where an exceptionally high density of Jackal Buzzards occurs (a pair or trio per 400 hectares, adjacent nests averaging 1.7 kilometres apart), several polyandrous trios have been found in which two males maintain a pair bond with a single female and jointly nest with her. The sexes, incidentally, can be distinguished by size, females being larger, and it is possible too, as is the case with Augur Buzzards, that females have black throats and males have white throats.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>It may seem odd that a bird should be named after a French Dominican friar or Jacobin, but apparently the connection lies in the resemblance of the pied plumage of the bird to the traditional black-and-white garb of the friars! Certainly the striking field feature of this species, and its congener Levaillant’s Cuckoo, is the colouration, as well as the distinct crest and loud, clamorous calls. Not all Jacobins are piebald though – there is a dark-breasted form which is common in the low-lying areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, and which occurs sparsely elsewhere in the eastern part of the region, but has not been recorded from Namibia, or north of the Zambezi.</p><p>This species is a summer migrant, arriving in southern Africa from October onwards, although a few overwinter in the region. Three distinct subspecies visit southern Africa from the Afrotropical region. One breeds in the region, parasitising bulbuls and the Common Fiscal, whereas the other two subspecies are non-breeding migrants, breeding farther north in Africa and India. The three subspecies are virtually indistinguishable in the field.</p><p>This species is a summer migrant, arriving in southern Africa from October onwards, although a few overwinter in the region.

One breeds in the region, parasitising bulbuls and the Common Fiscal, whereas the other two subspecies are non-breeding migrants, breeding farther north in Africa and India. The three subspecies are virtually indistinguishable in the field.</p><p>Locally breeding males are exceptionally vociferous on arrival, calling to attract females to their prominent song posts. Courtship feeding is a prelude to mating, and males search thoroughly among the foliage of trees for their preferred food of caterpillars. After mating, the female watches the host’s nest-building to ensure that she can lay an egg immediately after the host has laid her first or second egg. The hosts are ‘non-discriminators’ that tolerate the non-matching pure white egg of the cuckoo. However, the hosts do recognise the adult cuckoos as a threat, and mob them unrelentingly; the male cuckoo has been recorded distracting them in order to give the female the brief opportunity she needs to deposit a single egg in the host nest. Although the regular hosts are all solitary by nature, it appears as if their defences may be adequate to restrict the female cuckoos from accessing all their nests. Numerous other passerine species are occasional hosts, and many of these may be the victims of egg-dumping rather than parasitism per se. In these cases, the female cuckoo may be ‘caught short’ and has to get rid of an egg as a matter of urgency, discarding it in the nearest available nest.</p><p>As with all cuckoos, the incubation period of the Jacobin’s egg is relatively short, ensuring that the chick hatches before or soon after the others in the nest. Development of cuckoo embryos commences in the female’s oviduct before laying, contributing to the short incubation period, and could be the result of females retaining eggs until they find the optimal host nest. This delicate balancing act is one of the downsides to brood parasitism. Unlike Cuculus, Pachycoccyx and Chrysococcyx cuckoos, the young Jacobin Cuckoo does not evict its foster siblings, but it tends to outcompete them, maintaining the head start it obtains by hatching first. The host’s chicks soon become smothered underfoot and usually die of starvation.</p><p>Once the cuckoo chick fledges, the foster parents continue to feed it for up to a month – long after it is able to fend for itself. However, there comes a day in April when cooler weather sets in, and the youngster feels an irresistible urge to abandon its life of indulgence and head north. Its real parents are long gone, and yet it unerringly finds its way across the continent to a land where the grass is greener and its conspecifics congregate to recuperate after a hectic breeding season. If it survives the relatively high mortality rate to which young birds are subject, it will return the following year, heralding once more the rainy season with its loud, ringing call.&#9;</p>",

Found in pairs and small groups, it appears to be mostly sedentary with ringed birds recaptured within 10 km of the ringing site, although one individual did move 125 km. The oldest known Jameson’s Firefinch was more than seven years old when last recorded. These birds drink regularly at pools and birdbaths, and even sip water droplets from leaves; the availability of water may be important in determining their distribution. They feed mainly on the ground on fallen grass seeds, also on insects, including termite alates caught on the wing and workers exposed when their tunnels have been opened by other animals. This is one of our small bird species which has been recorded as trapped in a spider web.</p><p>Like other firefinches, Jameson’s Firefinch is monogamous, and the pair will regularly allopreen each other when perched together. Established pairs also show greeting behaviour, bowing to each other when reunited after a period of separation. The nests are well spaced out, suggesting that the birds are territorial when breeding. In courtship, the male holds a feather or strip of grass in his bill, then dances and bobs on a perch near the female, singing his shrill, trilling song. The female may then solicit copulation, crouching and quivering her tail.</p><p>Like other firefinches, Jameson’s Firefinch is monogamous, and the pair will regularly allopreen each other when perched together.

It is lined with feathers, and the male will often bring feathers at each visit to the nest during both the incubation and nestling periods. Both sexes incubate during the day, but only the female is on the nest at night. Once the chicks hatch they are initially brooded, and then fed, by both parents on insects, initially by regurgitation, later with items brought in the bill. Fledglings are also fed for several days after leaving the nest. Jameson’s Firefinch is parasitised by the Purple Indigobird Vidua purpurascens, the males of which include the song of this firefinch species in their courtship display. This relationship has been little studied, and there is no information on the breeding success of either species.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Kalahari Scrub-Robin is well named. It is one of the characteristic small insectivorous birds of open Kalahari sandveld with scattered low trees and bushes. In behaviour and habits, especially the compulsive, jerky erection of the closed tail, it closely resembles the more widespread White-browed Scrub-Robin, but it lacks the white wing bars of that species. It has a helpful ID characteristic when alighting on a perch after a flight; the tail is jerked to a vertical position, and the wings are flicked away from and above the body several times. Any sparrow-sized bird that performs this alighting habit can be reliably assumed a Kalahari Scrub-Robin, even when only seen in silhouette.</p><p>Early morning is a good time to find these birds because the usually cloudless nights in their semi-desert haunts can get quite cold, so the robins often sun themselves on the topmost twigs of bushes shortly after sunrise. Morning is also the best time to hear them singing. The song is a prolonged series of whistles and chirps. A typical passage, for example, could be ‘weeyoo, weeyoo, cheeep, weerip, weerip, willerip, willerip, cheeyoo, cheecheeyoo’.</p><p>Early morning is a good time to find these birds because the usually cloudless nights in their semi-desert haunts can get quite cold, so the robins often sun themselves on the topmost twigs of bushes shortly after sunrise.

A typical passage, for example, could be ‘weeyoo, weeyoo, cheeep, weerip, weerip, willerip, willerip, cheeyoo, cheecheeyoo’.</p><p>The Kalahari Scrub-Robin is not only a good singer, it is also an accomplished mimic. A breeding male may sing continuously for a couple of hours or more from sunrise and imitate a score or more different calls or parts of calls of other birds during that time. In the next song bout it may repeat half of these and add as many more from a repertoire of 40 to 50 imitations. Many of these imitations are good enough to fool the birds being mimicked, and a singing male was chased from its song post by a pair of Grey Penduline Tits whose calls it was imitating. Its contact call, which may be heard at any time of the day, is a sparrow-like ‘seeeup’, while the alarm call is a ‘scolding’ ‘tsik-tsik-tsik’.</p><p>Foraging takes place on the ground, the bird progressing with both running and hopping gait. They regularly occur in the vicinity of cattle dips because of the extensive surrounding areas of grazed and trampled ground; the insect fauna associated with cattle dung is probably also an attraction. They are fond of termites, including the large Harvester Termite workers, and they also eat beetles, grasshoppers, ants, spiders and centipedes. In the Kgalagadi Trans-Frontier Park, Richard Dean watched two Kalahari Scrub-Robins digging in the sandy soil to obtain what looked like tenebrionid beetle larvae. From their actions it appeared that the birds were able to hear movements of the beetle larvae underground.</p><p>A study of the breeding biology of Kalahari Scrub-Robins at the eastern edge of their range in the Polokwane Game Reserve estimated territory sizes of breeding pairs were 0.9-4.1 hectares. Derek Engelbrecht, who undertook the study, observed that song (including mimicry of other birds’ calls) forms an important part of courtship, and that while singing, the male slowly raises his fully fanned tail to the vertical position, and then quivers it like ‘a miniature peacock’. In both the Peacock and the Kalahari Scrub-Robin the tail pattern is the most decorative part of their plumage.</p><p>The scrub-robin’s breeding success rate was estimated at 22%, with many breeding attempts being thwarted by predators. Most of the breeding pairs were double-brooded, and one pair made six breeding attempts, three of which were successful, fledging seven young from 18 eggs. How many of those fledglings survived to join the adult scrub-robin population is not known.&#9;</p>",

Breeding pairs are sometimes accompanied by 2-3 younger males, which may indicate co-operative breeding. Young females disperse away from the family group, but where they go is unknown. The species is sedentary and the pair (or group) is territorial throughout the year. Only the female incubates, with the male remaining nearby. The female often sits very tight and, when flushed, performs a distraction display, running in a hunched manner and calling loudly.</p><p>Nests in the cultivated lands are very exposed and the eggs are an easy target for White-necked Ravens, as well as the recently arrived Pied Crows which are rapidly increasing in numbers. Terrestrial birds are at great risk from predators, and these bustards must rely heavily on their cryptic colouration to avoid detection. Near Swellendam a Karoo Bustard was seen vigorously chasing a low-flying Black Sparrowhawk that had ventured too near. The chase covered a few hundred metres with the sparrowhawk desperately ducking and diving – a most unusual sight indeed. Near Beervlei, in the Willowmore district, a Martial Eagle tried to take a Karoo Bustard on the ground. The bustard saw the approaching danger and took to flight, and the eagle gave up the attempt – once the element of surprise is lost, the chance of success is greatly reduced. Both these incidents showed the agile side of the bustard, an unsuspected attribute in what at first glance appears to be a rather clumsy bird.</p><p>The Karoo Bustard is not currently threatened. The South African population alone numbers in the hundreds of thousands, and the species occurs in a number of conservation areas. It has also adapted well to agricultural activities in the south of its range.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Karoo Chats are near-endemic to southern Africa, their range extending extralimitally north to about Benguela, Angola. In southern Africa the birds are restricted to the arid western regions, from the Namib Desert south to the Western Cape and east through the southern Kalahari and Karoo, to the south-western Free State and the dry west of the Eastern Cape. The birds are common and conspicuous throughout most of their range, but are scarce in hyperarid areas. Their habitat is the succulent and woody dwarf shrublands on plains and stony hillsides in the Succulent and Nama Karoo, and the stony and gravelly plains in the Namib Desert where there are sparse, perennial grasses. They show a high tolerance of habitat transformation and apparently reach their highest densities in heavily grazed karroid shrubland. Very occasionally, they visit gardens in Karoo villages where these abut shrublands.</p><p>Karoo Chats are adaptable foragers and feeders. They search the bases of grass tufts and shrubs, drop down onto prey from a perch, and feed on harvester termites foraging above ground. The birds also inspect the fresh diggings of Aardvarks Orycteropus afer and Bat-eared Foxes Otocyon megalotis and take whatever insects, including termites, may be active there. The diet is mainly insects, including grasshoppers, ants, bees, adult and larval beetles, weevils, and butterflies and moths and their caterpillars.

In the breeding season, the frequency and intensity of calling increases, and the birds are particularly vociferous if an intruder is near the nest. A new nest site is selected for each breeding attempt, so old nests, which take several years to decompose, are scattered about the territory. The active nest site is not easy to find – the birds give away very little, even when feeding nestlings. However, at Tierberg Karoo Research Centre, near Prince Albert, Karoo Chats were quick to learn that experimental plots designed to exclude herbivorous mammals also excluded predatory mongooses and Striped Polecats Ictonyx striata, so nesting inside these plots was relatively safe, and, because the plots were small, the nests were fairly easy to find.</p><p>The nest is placed on the ground under a shrub, frequently facing south or south-east. The nest is a deep cup, built on a foundation of greyish dry sticks and twigs, and thickly lined with soft plant material, usually fluffy seeds from Karoo Rosemary (Eriocephalus species) and sometimes lined with small, woolly, insect cocoons or a few hairs. Although wool and mohair is abundantly available across most of the species’ Karoo range, it is very rarely used as a nest lining. Incubation duties are not known, but it is suspected that it is by the female only. Nestlings are fed by both parents on insects and occasionally fruits from honey-thorns. Distraction displays by the adults include swooping down at the intruder, fluttering on the ground and feigning injury.</p>",

Their habitat is the arid and semi-arid shrubby rangelands on plains and hillsides, and on rocky hills where Karoo Gold or Granaat Rhigozum obovatum is common. In the Succulent Karoo, the birds favour shrublands where Melktou or Geelmelkbos Euphorbia mauritanica is common.</p><p>Karoo Eremomelas are usually in groups of three to ten, and are difficult to locate even when calling. In part, this is because they are unobtrusive, keeping low as they move between bushes, but also because groups range widely over their usually large territories. The birds maintain their territories throughout the year, the entire group being involved in territorial defence. Territory size varies between years: large, 50 to 100 hectares in dry years, smaller in wet years. In very dry or successive dry years, the birds may disappear entirely from an area. It is likely that the birds move closer to the mountains in dry years to benefit from the higher rainfall in those areas, moving back into the more productive rangelands in years with good rains.</p><p>Karoo Eremomelas are usually in groups of three to ten, and are difficult to locate even when calling.

The birds forage as a dispersed group, with members a few metres apart, keeping in touch with their burry contact call, superficially similar to that of the Spike-heeled Lark. They move quickly from shrub to shrub, or bush to bush, searching through the plants and gleaning items from branches and foliage, sometimes foraging on the ground. Food items include mantids, grasshoppers, plant hoppers (Cicadellidae) and ants as well as occasional fruits such as honey-thorns Lycium sp.</p><p>Karoo Eremomelas are facultative co-operative breeders. Group size varies according to breeding success and the number of young birds that the group has raised. Little is known about the composition of the groups, but it is likely that there is an alpha pair, with the remainder of the group made up of subordinate birds of both sexes. Nests are solitary, and are built by all members of the group – in one observation, eight birds perched on shrubs near a nest site each had a beakful of fluffy plant material, all hesitating to go to the nest because of my presence. They eventually plucked up the courage, and took their material to the nest one by one. The birds are sensitive to disturbance and are likely to desert the nest during the building and egg-laying stages, but in this particular case the group went on to successfully rear the nestlings.</p><p>The nest is a thick-walled cup, quite unlike the nest of any other eremomela species, and is built of very thin twigs, silky strips of Lammerlat Gomphocarpus filifolius bark, Old Man’s Beard Galium tomentosum peduncles, some dry grass and plant down, and thickly lined with soft fluffy seeds. The nest site is usually low down, 30-40 cm above ground, deep in a small, shrubby (and thorny) bush, such as African thistles Berkheya, Karoo Gold and honey-thorns, but also occasionally in Melktou or even in Old Man’s Beard. The group all call in alarm if the nest is approached, particularly when there are nestlings. Incubation duties are not known, and are possibly only by the alpha pair. The incubating bird can sit very tightly on the eggs, only moving from the nest when touched. The nestlings are fed by all group members. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Karoo Lark is endemic to South Africa, and occurs from the Richtersveld in the Northern Cape south to the Western Cape and Worcester Karoo, and from there east through the Little and Great Karoo to the western parts of the Eastern Cape Province. Its distribution has contracted locally – Karoo Larks have a low habitat transformation tolerance, and range contractions are almost certainly related to land-use changes. The birds avoid croplands, but occasionally occur in old fallow fields being colonised by shrubs such as Renosterbos Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis. Karoo Larks are found in shrublands, including strandveld, sand-plain fynbos and dwarf Karoo shrubland, favouring those on soft, sandy soils; they are less frequent on sandy clays and generally avoid rocky areas. The birds are noticeably less common where shrubs are shorter, such as those impacted by high grazing levels, and are less common on the shrublands of the cold, high-altitude plateau of the central Karoo. The poorly drained, very stony shrublands on clays in the central Karoo have low populations of Karoo Larks. The distribution of the Karoo Lark overlaps with Barlow’s Lark in a narrow contact zone between Port Nolloth and Sende&#173;lingsdrift, and apparent hybrids between the two species have been observed in this area. Both species favour shrublands on sandy soils, but in the zone of overlap, Karoo Larks occur in taller shrubland.</p><p>Foraging for food is well known in the Karoo Lark. The birds forage on the ground, searching at bases of grass tufts and shrubs, sometimes gleaning food from leaves. They dig with their bills in sandy soils and dig into termite soil dumps to extract termite workers. Food includes invertebrates such as thread-wing lacewings (Nemopteridae), mantids, grasshoppers, weevils, sapsuckers and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), beetles (Salpingidae, Cassidae, Carabidae), coccid beetles (Lacciferidae), fly larvae, ants, snails and spiders. Seeds of many grasses and shrubs are eaten, as well as fruits of honey-thorns (Lycium species), and leaves and flower parts of several species of shrubs.</p><p>Foraging for food is well known in the Karoo Lark.

In the southern and central Karoo, the birds breed opportunistically in response to rain, so nests may be found at almost any time of the year. Courtship and territorial displays in the Prince Albert area have been recorded in September-January and March-May, and the birds begin to call and display within a day of rain. Displaying males sing in flight or from a perch on a high point. They fly up from a perch on rapidly beating wings, at times almost hovering, or cruise in laboured flight, with slow, deep wingbeats, tail depressed, calling almost continually. Nests are placed in a hollow or scrape in the ground at the base of a grass tuft or shrub, and are built by the female, accompanied by the male on material collecting trips. The nest is well concealed, and is a cup of dry grass, strips of silky bark, leaf petioles, thin twigs and sometimes a few leaves. The material is built up at the back and sides of the nest to form a dome if the site is rather open. The lining is of silky Bushman grass awns and woolly seeds. Two or three eggs are laid, but the incubation period and parental duties during incubation are unknown. Newly hatched nestlings have characteristic ‘mouth spots’: three black tongue spots and one black spot at the tip of each mandible. The nestlings leave the nest before they are able to fly, walking behind their parents, and frequently begging for food.</p>",

Karoo Long-billed Larks inhabit the semi-arid dwarf shrublands and grassy shrublands on stony plains and rocky ridges. Most of their habitat is rangeland, with very little agriculture, and the birds seem unaffected by the transformation of rangelands through heavy or overgrazing. Karoo Long-billed Larks do occur in the small areas that have been ploughed and planted, and are said to be a problem in croplands, digging out seeds.</p><p>The birds are common in the Karoo, and are resident and sedentary, apparently defending territories all year round. There may be some local nomadism, but if so, is probably by juvenile and not adult birds. At Wolwekraal Nature Reserve, near Prince Albert, Karoo Long-billed Larks can almost always be seen on coarsely vegetated low ridges of river-rolled quartzite pebbles and stones. The birds also occur on the table-topped relic land surfaces (known as ‘oervlakte’ at Uniondale). Plant cover is sparse on these ridges and flat-topped koppies, and the larks are easy to observe while they forage or are building nests in these places.</p><p>The birds are common in the Karoo, and are resident and sedentary, apparently defending territories all year round.

Males sing from the ground, from a low perch or in aerial display all year round, but mainly in the pre-breeding period. The song, given in display, is a loud, far-carrying descending whistle, ‘peeeuuuu’, sometimes preceded by a short, soft introductory ‘whi’, heard only at close range. Males sometimes sing softly while walking or foraging, and in social interactions and during chases give a set of lower-pitched, burry, rolling whistles, very similar in sound to those given by the Eastern Long-billed Lark. The display flight is also similar to that species – the male Karoo Long-billed Lark flies just above the ground, then rises near-vertically to about 15 metres with closed wings, then stalls, whistles, and drops vertically with wings closed until just before reaching the ground and then continues with a horizontal flight. More than one display may be performed in the same flight. What is not known is whether the display is over a female, or over the nest site, or whether along a territorial boundary. Sometimes, displays are performed over a small patch of shrubland, and sometimes over a larger area, and sometimes by males carrying food to nestlings.</p><p>Karoo Long-billed Larks nest on the ground, digging a shallow hole on the south or east side at the base of a shrub or stone. They build a neat cup of twigs, roots and rootlets, lined with fluffy seeds, often from Karoo rosemary (Eriocephalus species). Nests sometimes have a wide apron of nest material on one side or a partial dome formed against overhanging foliage. Incubation duties are unknown, but the nestlings are fed by both parents, who approach the nest cautiously, landing away from the nest and walking to it, and then walking away from the nest before flying off. The young birds are fed by the parents for some weeks after leaving the nest.</p><p>Karoo Long-billed Larks forage by using their long bill to turn over stones, to knock down termite surface workings and to dig in the soft soil at the base of plants and stones for larvae and pupae. Their food includes grasshoppers, weevils, dipteran larvae, mantids, lepidopteran larvae, antlions, ants, beetles, termites, spiders and solifugids, seeds of shrubs, small fruits, and small corms of Iridaceae, presumably digging them up.</p>",

It is one of 24 prinias worldwide, 13 of which occur in Africa and four in southern Africa.</p><p>It is a typical member of the genus, being drab and long-tailed, and it would be easily overlooked were it not for its vocal nature. The call that is most commonly heard is a loud, almost metallic ‘kli-kli-kli’, often repeated for long periods. In parts of its range it is abundant, and it was one of the most frequently recorded species during the Cape Bird Club’s south-western Cape Atlas Project. It is at home in a wide variety of habitats, from scrub and fynbos to suburban gardens and alien wattle infestations, avoiding only plantations and forests. It occurs over a wide altitudinal range from the top of the Great Escarpment (2&#160;700&#160;m) in the Karoo National Park to sea level, even feeding in the intertidal zone at times. The name ‘Karoo’ is somewhat misleading, even though much of its range is within the Karoo. It is certainly not confined to dry habitats, being quite common in the well-watered kloofs of coastal mountains. On the other hand it also manages to survive in the arid landscapes of southern Namibia where the rainfall is less than 100 mm per annum.</p><p>It is a typical member of the genus, being drab and long-tailed, and it would be easily overlooked were it not for its vocal nature.

They tend to be sedentary, occupying and defending a territory throughout the year. The nest is typical of many prinia species – a pear-shaped structure with an outer ‘skeleton’ of long, very thin green stems and inner walls neatly constructed from plant down and wool. It is well made and very snug which is just as well, because in the south-western Cape some start nest-building as early as July when the weather is often wet and cold. Other creatures also find the nests to their liking: mice are the most frequent ‘squatters’, but whether they only use nests from which the young have already fledged or whether they take over active nests is not known. The small Grey Climbing Mouse Dendromus melanotis is particularly given to using birds’ nests and is probably the most common usurper of prinia nests. Nests taken over by mice are easily identified because the nest entrance is invariably closed over by the new tenant. Another menace that prinias, along with many other species, have to contend with is the alien Argentine Ant Linepithema humile that attacks and kills the nestlings.</p><p>In 1961 the late Bunty Rowan made an interesting discovery near Vanwyksvlei in the central Great Karoo. She found a pair of prinias feeding a fledgling: one parent was a Karoo Prinia, the other a Black-chested Prinia. This was an intriguing instance of hybridisation, and one wonders how often this occurs but is overlooked because the ranges of the two species meet in an area with such a sparse human population.</p><p>In January 1994 a pair of Karoo Prinias nesting in a Somerset West garden was seen feeding a newly fledged Brown-backed Honeybird (a species known to parasitise the very closely related Drakensberg Prinia). In September of the same year the prinias (presumably the same pair) raised two honeybirds and in October another one. Brown-backed Honeybird is a relative newcomer to the south-western Cape (first recorded in Caledon in the Overberg in 1986) and to date the Karoo Prinia is its only known host in this region.&#9;</p>",

Robins such as the Kalahari and Karoo Scrub-Robins differ by living mainly in the drier regions of southern Africa, and they are both brownish-col&#173;oured birds. The Karoo Scrub-Robin, however, has some basic characteristics that belie its relationship to other scrub-robins, notwithstanding recent genetic research findings to the contrary.</p><p>My first inkling of this came on a sunny September day amid one of the finest Namaqualand wildflower displays one could wish to see. While we paused at a roadside dam near Nababeep, a Karoo Scrub-Robin popped into view carrying food. I was soon looking at my first Karoo Scrub-Robin’s nest. The two chicks were about ten days old and reasonably well feathered. But there was something odd. Both chicks had wispy down feathers still attached to the new feathering of their crowns and backs. This is normal for most robins, but not for scrub-robins, whose chicks hatch naked. It was the first clue that the Karoo Scrub-Robin’s relationships might not be what they were thought to be.</p><p>My first inkling of this came on a sunny September day amid one of the finest Namaqualand wildflower displays one could wish to see.

This is normal for most robins, but not for scrub-robins, whose chicks hatch naked. It was the first clue that the Karoo Scrub-Robin’s relationships might not be what they were thought to be.</p><p>The habitat of this species varies from strandveld, where they run across stretches of open sand between thickets, to the Little Karoo, where they scamper around beneath the cloaking renosterbos. When not foraging, they may rest on a gnarled renosterbos root to preen, well concealed by the overhead cover. Now and then a pair or a family group will pop up to perch on an emergent shrub and indulge in a noisy greeting ceremony with much wing flicking and tail waving. The late C&#160;J&#160;Skead aptly termed this behaviour ‘skizzlezitting’. Exaggerated tail movements during these displays may remind one of scrub-robins, but the Karoo Scrub-Robin’s movements are not the same. On the ground it uses both hopping and running gaits, standing upright with a perceptible jerk of its tail at the end of a run, but it does not elevate its tail to the extreme vertical position so characteristic of most scrub-robins.</p><p>Some other ways in which it differs from the scrub-robins are the ground colour of its eggs (turquoise not white), its nest materials and architecture (made of sticks, not grass), and the number of unpatterned central tail feathers (four, not two). It shares these characteristics with a trio of south-west arid birds: the Sickle-winged, Karoo and Tractrac chats, and these may be its closest relatives.</p><p>Aside from the question of its relationship, however, the Karoo Scrub-Robin has other intriguing aspects of behaviour. For example, it commonly includes significant quantities of rodent fur in its nest lining, which it obtains from mongoose scats. It has different warning notes for different kinds of predators – a ‘kweeek-kweeek-kweeek…’ call when it sees a mongoose, and a series of clicks when it comes across a snake (hence its Afrikaans name).</p><p>Its most noteworthy behaviour, in which it differs from all other African robins, is that some pairs have helpers at the nest. The surviving members of an earlier brood (including a successful brood from the previous season) bring food to the male to give to the incubating female, and assist in the feeding of the chicks, often queuing up with the adults when arriving at the nest with food. Up to 90% of Karoo Scrub-Robin breeding attempts fail due to predation, and given that a breeding pair makes three to four attempts in any one season, on average they only fledge young in one year out of three. &#9;</p>",

This was before taxonomists ‘split’ it into two – the Olive Thrush and the Karoo Thrush. The distribution maps show the complementary ranges of the (now) two species, both of which still behave the way they did under their original single hat. Whether the thrush in your garden is an ‘Olive Thrush’ or a ‘Karoo Thrush’ thus depends on where the garden is. In the Northern Cape the bird will look like the Karoo Thrush, and along the Garden Route it will appear to be a typical Olive Thrush, but in between there are lots of intermediate thrushes.</p><p>Karoo Thrushes do most of their foraging on the ground. They like lawns, on which they run or hop rapidly with head and body horizontal, then stop and stand upright to listen for earthworm movements. The old English adage ‘the early bird gets the worm’ was almost certainly coined from the foraging habits of Blackbirds Turdus merulaand Song Thrushes T. philomelasthat check out lawns before sunrise. Earthworms are close to the surface at daybreak and their brown castes give away their position. A good earthworm population in a well-watered lawn can attract lots of Karoo Thrushes.</p><p>Karoo Thrushes do most of their foraging on the ground.

A good earthworm population in a well-watered lawn can attract lots of Karoo Thrushes.</p><p>The plunder of earthworms by lawn-foraging thrushes may concern some gardeners, but there is a credit side to the thrushes’ diet sheet. They eat a lot of garden pests such as cutworms and ubiquitous introduced snails such as Helix adspersa. Fallen leaves beneath shrubs can shelter a wide range of invertebrates, and foraging thrushes regularly visit such leaf litter, vigorously whisking leaves aside or raking them backward with one foot. Karoo Thrushes, like their Olive Thrush kin, are very partial to fruit, and are not considered welcome visitors in Northern Cape vineyards. They usually forage beneath fruit-laden trees to pick up fallen fruits on the ground, but also pluck fruit still on trees and shrubs.</p><p>I saw my first genuine ‘Karoo’ Thrushes in the camping grounds at the Augrabies Falls National Park in the Northern Cape. They feed freely on the lawns amongst the campers’ tents, especially in the evening twilight and, in contrast to the Olive Thrushes of the Western Cape, are grey on the chest and very dark-coloured above. Their russet-coloured bellies are only glimpsed in flight. Their ‘chink-chink-chink’ alarm call is similar to that of the Olive Thrush, but lacks its ringing tone; it reminded me of the flat tone of a cracked bell. For those who venture into the Great Karoo, these thrushes can also be found in the wooded drainage lines, though they are apt to be much shyer when not habituated to frequent human presence.</p><p>Karoo Thrushes are perhaps even more itinerant than Olive Thrushes. One ornitholo&#173;gist who had lots of thrushes in his garden decided to start a study of them and fitted individual combinations of colour rings on every thrush he caught. He had to abort the project, however, when he ran out of new combinations in little more than a month, and he saw hardly any of his ringed thrushes again. There are records of ringed birds moving, for example, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and between Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp, but overall the recapture rate for these birds is not high, and we are largely ignorant of why they move around as much as they seem to do.</p>",

Southern African birds differ from other populations in skull structure, and the adults usually have dark eyes, resulting in speculation that our birds (L. d. vetula) might be a distinct species. However, recent studies show that there is ongoing gene flow from nominate birds from South America. Kelp Gulls, presumably from South America, are regular vagrants to Tristan da Cunha, and likely reach southern Africa. Vagrancy from the tiny, resident sub-Antarctic population (L. d. judithae) is less likely.</p><p>Kelp Gulls take several years to acquire adult plumage and only start breeding at four years old. Juveniles are mostly brown and could be confused with the chunkier Subantarctic Skua, but the main identification challenge is the Lesser Black-backed Gull, a rare Palaearctic summer migrant. In southern Africa, Kelp Gulls occur from southern Angola to Delagoa Bay, Mozambique, but usually only breed as far east as Algoa Bay. After fledging, young birds disperse around the coast. Juveniles from Eastern Cape colonies mainly disperse eastwards, whereas those from the Western Cape tend to disperse north, with some reaching central Namibia, which appears to be an important nursery area. However, some Namibian birds disperse south, with a few reaching the Western Cape. By comparison, adults are relatively sedentary, seldom moving more than 30 kilometres from their breeding areas.</p><p>Kelp Gulls take several years to acquire adult plumage and only start breeding at four years old.

Juveniles, in particular, have benefited from these easy pickings, allowing for enhanced survival to breeding age. In the Western Cape there is a growing trend for non-breeding birds to disperse to over 100 kilometres inland, where they feed at chicken farms and on the afterbirth of newborn lambs. This numerical increase has increased predation pressure on other seabirds; Kelp Gulls have become important predators of the eggs and small young of penguins, gannets and cormorants, contributing to the decline of these species. In recent years the gulls breeding on Dassen Island and other nearby islands have been impacted by predatory Great White Pelicans, but this has only slowed the growth in the number of breeding birds and colonies.</p><p>One of the main reasons for the Kelp Gull’s success is its adaptability and wide food tolerance. They scavenge from fishing vessels more than 100 kilometres offshore, eat introduced snails in west coast pastures, and catch termite alates in the air. However, most foraging occurs in coastal habitats, where they feed extensively on mussels and other invertebrates. They also take large numbers of small pelagic fish, hovering over feeding groups of cormorants and penguins to snatch fish within half a metre of the water surface.</p><p>Most gulls breed in colonies, but there has been a recent increase in the numbers of lone pairs breeding above the high-water mark on more isolated beaches. With the huge reduction of off-road vehicle usage on the coast, many more beaches have become sufficiently isolated for these birds to breed undisturbed. However, such isolated pairs often suffer higher rates of predation, because the birds rely on group mobbing efforts to deter mammalian predators. Anyone who has walked through a Kelp Gull colony will attest to the vigour with which they defend their young, defecating onto intruders, and even striking them on the head.</p>",

They breed in spring at sub-Antarctic islands. After breeding, they disperse south, foraging along the edge of the ice-free zone, reaching the edge of Antarctica. It is an extremely rare vagrant in southern Africa in most years, but irrupts into the region occasionally. There was a small influx in August-September 1980, and then a major irruption in July 1984, when hundreds were subsequently wrecked from the Western Cape to northern KwaZulu-Natal. This coincided with irruptions of other Southern Ocean species that typically remain well south of the continent, notably Blue Petrels. A similar wreck occurred at the same time in Australasia: indeed, in south-west Australia a disbelieving birder came across a Kerguelen Petrel flying over arid plains 200 km inland! Some populations have suffered from introduced predators, leading to its extinction from some islands, but the total population exceeds a million birds and is not considered to be threatened.</p>",

They breed in dense colonies, and because they are rather clumsy on land, they favour gently sloping sites with sheltered landing beaches. Like their larger cousin, the Emperor Penguin, they lay a single egg which is balanced on their feet during incubation. This duty is shared between the sexes. Amazingly, they can store food in their stomachs for several weeks to feed the newly hatched chick. Breeding is protracted, with eggs laid in spring, producing fledged chicks in autumn. However, chicks from  eggs laid later in the season have to survive the long sub-Antarctic winter.</p><p>King Penguins breed throughout the sub-Antarctic, with more than 200 000 pairs at South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands.

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is essentially a sub-Saharan species, with a small outlying population found at Egypt’s Aswan Dam and the Nile Delta, and another resident in Madagascar. The main population is divided into two groups. One occurs from the Sahel zone south to the coast in West Africa, and the other has a fragmented distribution from the Sudan and Ethiopia south to South Africa. In southern Africa it is widespread and locally common. The total regional population is estimated to peak at over 50&#160;000 birds when local birds are supplemented by migrants from further north. Its distribution is largely determined by the availability of suitable bodies of water, but although it is most closely associated with water it also occurs in dry habitats such as at airfields and dry pans. In coastal areas it favours salt marsh habitats rather than the open shore, but does forage on mudflats in estuaries at low tide. Along with the White-fronted Plover, it is the only plover that is regularly resident on offshore islands where there is suitable bare habitat.</p><p>Coastal populations tend to be the most sedentary, with movement mainly along the coastal plain in response to the flooding and drying of habitats. At times this can result in large aggregations of birds as happens at water bodies in the vicinity of Cape Town, and along the west coast at Velddrif and Verlorenvlei. Inland, the birds tend to be more mobile, being both nomadic and migratory. In high-rainfall areas, such as in Zambia and Zimbabwe, seasonal flooding forces migration, with many birds moving south; most such movements seemingly happen at night, and in flocks. At Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province, recent studies have shown that the area contains residents, nomads, passage migrants and migratory visitors.</p><p>Coastal populations tend to be the most sedentary, with movement mainly along the coastal plain in response to the flooding and drying of habitats.

At Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province, recent studies have shown that the area contains residents, nomads, passage migrants and migratory visitors.</p><p>The numbers and range of Kittlitz’s Plover have increased considerably over the last century, with impoundments providing vast areas of suitable habitat. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Free State where huge irrigation dams provide regular, permanent habitats enjoyed by the plovers. Such habitat manipulation by man has probably altered both the birds’ patterns of occurrence and movement.</p><p>Breeding normally takes place on a dry surface fairly close to water. Favoured sites are on extensive mudflats left by receding waters where the nests may be hundreds of metres from water. The birds often choose a nest site close to a stone or a piece of driftwood and frequently between the tracks left by vehicles; this probably serves to break up the silhouette of the incubating bird. The nest is a shallow scrape in the ground, usually surrounded with loose debris such as grit, mud flakes, dead vegetation and small mammal droppings. When the brooding bird is disturbed it stands up and quickly scrapes the loose material over the eggs to conceal them, leaving a clearly defined ring with a small mound in the middle. This not only hides the eggs from predators but also protects them from the sun’s rays.</p><p>During the incubation period the birds maintain a fairly extensive territory around the nest. However, within two days of the young hatching, this territory is abandoned as the family party wanders more widely along the water’s edge, with feeding taking place mainly during the twilight periods and on moonlit nights. The young can fly some 24 to 26 days after hatching and quickly become independent of their parents. Although the breeding cycle is fairly rapid, there is no evidence that Kittlitz’s Plovers in the wild are double-brooded, despite double-brooding in captivity.</p>",

Some of the intricacies of this breeding strategy have been unravelled by biologists, and make for interesting reading.</p><p>Like all Old World cuckoos, Klaas’s is a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nests of other, unrelated, birds. Some of the intricacies of this breeding strategy have been unravelled by biologists, and make for interesting reading.</p><p>In southern Africa, the resident population of Klaas’s Cuckoo is found year-round in mesic broad-leaved woodlands and forests down the eastern seaboard. It is supplemented during summer by an influx of migrants, and it is at this time that the species is more widespread and encountered in semi-arid Acacia woodlands in Namibia, Botswana and western Zimbabwe. At the onset of breeding in spring, the repetitive, bi-syllabic whistle advertises the birds’ presence; like other cuckoos, it is heard more than seen. This species is a leaf-gleaner, and both sexes are relatively well camouflaged among the foliage as they search for caterpillars and other insects, building up their condition for breeding.</p><p>After mating, the female lays a single egg in the nest of any one of 18 species, belonging to three main groups – sunbirds, batises and warblers – the exact choice depending on the area and available hosts. Predictably, the cuckoo removes one of the host’s eggs when laying hers. This is ‘normal’ – albeit seemingly devious – cuckoo behaviour! The relatively short incubation period of the cuckoo egg is also typical – it ensures that the chick will hatch before or soon after its foster siblings, which it will invariably expel from the nest by physically pushing them out. This extraordinary, bizarre behaviour makes the cuckoo one of the most fascinating families to study. There are still more questions than answers, though, and imaginative hypotheses are needed before a complete understanding of brood parasitism will be achieved.</p><p>Imagine, for example, the next stage in the young cuckoo’s life. How is it that the host does not realise that the vastly different cuckoo is not its own offspring? It seems so blatant to us! This has been a fruitful area for research, and it has been shown that learning plays a vital role in egg and chick rejection. First-time parents ‘imprint’ on their first-laid eggs, and since cuckoos usually wait until the host has laid some eggs, the hosts are able to use their own eggs as the standard against which to judge all future eggs. This has led to the evolution of ‘discriminator’ hosts and ‘matcher’ parasites, where the host rejects eggs that are not identical to its own. However, in the case of the chicks, the cuckoo chick is often first to hatch so this can be most confusing! It is not the whole story, though, because the incidence of para&#173;sitism is generally low (&lt;10%) – what happens when the host species raises several broods of its own chicks without ever seeing a Klaas’s Cuckoo chick? Following evolutionary theory, it has been hypothesised that the development of chick rejection behaviour is too risky – imagine if the hosts accidentally rejected their own offspring, they would be faced with extinction – so the hosts cannot afford to take any chances. Since most hosts recognise and chase adult cuckoos, there must come a time, though, when the chick (which resembles the adult female cuckoo) is identified by the foster parents – one can only imagine the ensuing confusion!</p><p>The relationship between Klaas’s Cuckoo and its numerous host species is a flexible one which is still evolving. So far there is no winner in this avian equivalent of the arms race – only an uneasy truce!&#9;</p>",

The male has a rounded fleshy knob on the top of the bill which increases dramatically in size during the breeding season. The male is noticeably larger than the female, weighing about 2 kg, as opposed to the female at 1.5 kg. This is perhaps to be expected because this species nests in holes in trees, and the larger size of the male would preclude the use of many of the holes in the areas where they breed.</p><p>The Knob-billed Duck is widespread and common in many parts of Africa south of the Sahara. It is currently thought to be a different species from the rather similar Comb Duck that occurs in India. In southern Africa it is most common from about Gauteng northwards, outside the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. It is not generally known in the southern part of South Africa although we saw a female in the Mossel Bay area some years ago, and the following year a pair bred near Plettenberg Bay.  However, the species has not been recorded since. It is generally more common in the larger river systems and their associated flood plains but can be locally common in various parts of the Zimbabwe plateau and even in the drier west around Hwange. It was conspicuously nomadic on the Zimbabwe plateau where the numbers fluctuated from year to year and from season to season, with the lowest numbers being recorded in mid- to late summer when the birds had moved into the Save Valley to breed.</p><p>The Knob-billed Duck is widespread and common in many parts of Africa south of the Sahara.

They can gather in large flocks in croplands containing grain and groundnuts. It is interesting watching this species stripping the seeds off emergent grasses in shallow water. They walk from one seed head to the next pulling the seeds off with their beak and swallowing them.</p><p>In summer the floodplains of rivers like the Save River can become extensive wetlands. If good rains fall there are innumerable small pans in the Mopane veld growing on the sediment of the flood plains. It is to these ephemeral pans that the Knob-billed Ducks come in large numbers to breed. The larger Mopane trees have many holes, some of which are large enough to accommodate a female Knob-billed Duck. The dominant males, which are obvious from the larger size of the knob at the top of the bill, stake out a territory on these pans and they exclude other males from their territory. This is done by flying at the lesser males and clapping their wings together to chase them away. The dominant males may have more than one female if their territory contains more than one hole suitable for nesting. If the water remains long enough the nest holes may be used more than once in a season, but usually the water dries up too quickly for this to happen. Outside these temporary nesting areas on the floodplains, nesting is much rarer and is limited by the number of holes in trees big enough to accommodate the female Knob-billed Duck. It is noteworthy that prior to and during egg-laying, the females will spend a lot of time dabbling and eating arthropod food rather than vegetation because this is more nutritious and helps to build them up for egg-laying. The female has to defend her nest hole from other females!</p>",

They are generally found at low altitudes, from close to sea level to almost 1&#160;500 metres in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. A true forest species, they occur in Afromontane forest, in coastal forest and secondary forest in the south of their range, and in riverine forest in the fynbos area. In KwaZulu-Natal they are restricted to mistbelt, Afromontane forest.</p><p>Knysna Turacos are sometimes solitary, sometimes in pairs, or in family groups of three to seven birds. The latter gatherings are presumably a pair with the young of the year or from the previous year. In the forests of the southern Cape, group size typically numbers from three to six. Larger groups may gather at fruiting trees, but move away alone or in pairs when disturbed. The birds are generally rather inconspicuous and unobtrusive unless one knows the various contact calls, but are frequently seen in the Knysna area, flying across roads from one forest patch to another, revealing the bright crimson wing patches as they fly. They also sunbathe while perched on the canopy in the early morning or late afternoon. To residents of the southern, Western and Eastern Cape, the crowing or barking call rising to a crescendo is a familiar sound, although the bird itself may not be so visible. Calling by one bird frequently stimulates others to call, but the chorus often ends very abruptly.</p><p>Knysna Turacos are sometimes solitary, sometimes in pairs, or in family groups of three to seven birds.

In captivity, one bird sometimes fed its mate by regurgitation, but this has not been recorded in the wild. The nest is built by both sexes, with most nest-building activity taking place between early morning and about noon. Nest material – thin, brittle twigs – is taken from the canopy of trees and used to build a shallow platform high above ground in the outer branches of a tree. The white eggs are almost spherical, a characteristic of eggs laid by all turacos except the go-away birds and the extralimital plantain-eaters (Crinifer species). The nestlings develop rapidly and by 20 days old clamber around in branches surrounding the nest. At this stage, they are still unable to fly even though the primary feathers are well grown and starting to show their bright crimson colouration.</p><p>Knysna Turacos eat fruit, ranging from small berries to large fruits, including fruits of cycads and a wide range, or even all, of the juicy-fruited shrub and tree species that occur in their forest habitat. Infrequently they also take invertebrate prey, such as termite alates. Fruits are taken in the canopy of trees, but they do descend to the understorey to feed on the fruits of low-growing shrubs, and even take fallen fruits. The birds feed on cultivated fruits, such as guavas. They enter gardens to feed on fruiting trees and bushes such as Cherry Guavas, Loquats, Hawthorne and other alien plants. They also come to bird tables in gardens near forests to eat Water Melon, Spanspek and grapes. They drink regularly, both from forest streams and from bird baths, usually in the early morning and mid- to late afternoon. They bathe, squatting down, splashing water all over the body, tail held vertical and fanned, and wings partly opened. They will completely saturate the feathers before preening and flying off. The birds are locally impacted by forest destruction in South Africa, and may be threatened by the increasing harvesting of medicinal plants.</p>",

I crawl closer and pry open the curtain of low branches until I’m able to see the mossy forest floor. And there merely metres away, is my quarry: a Knysna Warbler in full song!</p><p>The Knysna Warbler was described in 1860 by Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall, from a specimen collected at the town of Knysna, which also gave its name to the Knysna Turaco and the Knysna Woodpecker. Knysna lies at the heart of the warbler’s restricted range, which extends west to the leafy suburbs of Cape Town, and east to approximately Port St Johns. It was formerly recorded as far north as Port Shepstone and even Durban, but is now believed to be mostly extinct in KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>Due to its small, fragmented global range, the Knysna Warbler is classified as Vulnerable, with an estimated population possibly as low as 2&#160;500 adults. Numbers continue to fall, with a 50% decrease in the last two decades in some areas. One of the main threats this species faces is deterioration of its specialised habitat: the tangled understorey of evergreen coastal and inland forests, especially along the thickly vegetated banks of forest streams and at forest edges.</p><p>On the Cape Peninsula they are threatened by decreased fire frequency adjacent to forests on the east-facing slopes of Table Mountain, resulting in forests expanding outwards from valleys and the loss of understorey cover along streams. Particularly in urban parts of the Peninsula, this species is increasingly confined to degraded green belts and adjacent gardens, even though these are filled with alien plants. Likewise, along the Garden Route, some suburban gardens with plentiful low shrubbery also boast resident pairs of Knysna Warblers. It appears that open garden lawns substitute the role of fire by allowing sufficient sunlight to penetrate and promote the dense understorey this species requires. However, a balanced fire regime is essential – uncontrolled fires can also have detrimental effects on local populations.</p><p>Together with the Little Rush and Barratt’s Warblers, the Knysna Warbler falls in the genus Bradypterus. This name is derived from the Greek ‘slow-wing’, in reference to the birds’ weak flight on their short, rounded wings or perhaps their overall reluctance to fly. In fact, they forage primarily on the ground, walking with a stooped posture, and occasionally scratching about or squatting in the leaf litter and fluttering their wings to expose their prey of spiders, woodlice, insects and snails.</p><p>This species is best located by its piercing song, an accelerating series of very high ‘tik’ notes climaxing in a bubbling trill. Singing males typically remain concealed in dense cover, but sing throughout the day, and sometimes at night, during the breeding season. Adjacent males may sing from as little as 15 metres apart. The sexes are difficult to distinguish on sight, but the experienced ear can detect a difference in their contact calls, those of the female being more subdued. &#9;</p>",

As they move along, both sexes give a shrill scream at infrequent intervals, usually rendered ‘skreeeeeaa’ or ‘wheeeeeaa’, similar to the call of the Golden-tailed Woodpecker. They have a high-pitched chattering call as well, but this is less obvious than the scream. The males are not known to drum.</p><p>Being a fairly small woodpecker, the nest hole is only about 45&#160;mm in diameter and may be constructed in any dead branch or trunk. It nests in various indigenous trees, and I found a pair nesting in a dead pine tree. They have been recorded as nesting in gardens in George, Sedgefield and Kenton-on-Sea. They are one of few birds in the southern Cape which is known to make use of sisal logs for nesting, even those put up in gardens to attract birds. The nest is usually 1-6 metres above the ground. This limited height range probably results from its preference for thickets, where tall trees are rare, hence most branches above this height are too thin to accommodate a nest.</p><p>Both the male and female incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and remove the faecal sacs from the nest to maintain nest hygiene. The eggs probably take 15-16 days to hatch and the young spend 25-29 days in the nest before fledging. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>A gigantic Kori Bustard striding across the open plains of Africa is one of the continent’s most memorable and iconic sights. The gait of the species is like that of other bustards: both deliberate and slightly mincing. The short but always-obvious crest that adorns the rear of the head, and which frequently bends this way and that in the wind, immediately sets it apart from all others of its kin in the region. Its English name stems from the Tswana appellation for the species. The Afrikaans name comes from the curious habit of this bustard feeding on the gum exuded by the Acacia trees so characteristic of its arid haunts.</p><p>The Kori Bustard’s fame as the heaviest flying bird in the world has recently been threatened by a record of a particularly obese Great Bustard. On average, though, a typical mature male Kori Bustard in prime breeding condition probably still overshadows this contender. When hard-pressed after being caught in the open, its laboured flight as it flees for the cover of nearby woodlands, head and neck outstretched and slightly drooping, confirms how far this species tests the physical limits of powered flight.</p><p>The Kori Bustard’s fame as the heaviest flying bird in the world has recently been threatened by a record of a particularly obese Great Bustard.

When hard-pressed after being caught in the open, its laboured flight as it flees for the cover of nearby woodlands, head and neck outstretched and slightly drooping, confirms how far this species tests the physical limits of powered flight.</p><p>Male bustards are renowned for their nuptial displays, and the Kori Bustard is no exception. A breeding male erects its crest and tail, puffs out its neck feathers, and droops its wings to maximise the impression of its size, and perhaps best display its black-and-white wing panels. At their peak, such displays can be accompanied by deep booming calls. Its imposing appearance is designed to both attract females and repel competing males. When a rival suitor fails to give way, a chest-to-chest shoving match can ensue, and the heavy and sharp beak will be brought into play. Blood can and does flow when such heavyweights square up.</p><p>I once set up a hide close to an incubating female at the base of the harsh, stony foothills of the Nuweveld Mountains in the Karoo National Park. Her defences against potential predators were shrewd. She crouched flat on the nest in the face of vehicles rattling by on a nearby road, relying on her camouflage for protection. Her reaction to the immature Martial Eagle that occasionally soared low over the nesting area was quite different and she quickly dashed, doubled-over, into the cover of some nearby trees lining a fossil watercourse. She clearly recognised the threat from this formidable raptor, the only bird of prey likely to dare tackle her directly, but counted on her eggs being safely beneath the dignity of this regal predator. Cheeky Pale Chanting Goshawks and Steppe Buzzards were merely stared down with contemptuous distain. A menacing and regularly marauding Cape Grey Mongoose, with its beady eyes firmly fixed on the eggs, was met with an uncompromising head-on ‘shock display’, where the wings were suddenly flared outwards and forwards, and the tail was raised and fanned. This no-nonsense challenge was clearly ready to be backed up if necessary with a resounding clout from the outstretched carpal joints, rapier-like jab from the beak or perhaps a stunning kick from the sturdy legs and feet. In the face of such fortitude, this fierce little predator invariably decided that discretion, the form of a sullen retreat, was the better part of valour.</p><p>As is typical of most members of the family, at no stage did any male bustard ever attend her, and I felt like her only companion during her long, lonely and dangerous vigil. After just over three weeks, her two eggs hatched. I weighed, measured and photographed the downy fruits of her hard-won efforts, and then left her to try and rear them in this unforgiving landscape.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the commonest and most widespread of the three southern African buttonquails. Kurrichane Buttonquails are less richly coloured than Black-rumped Buttonquails, but could be confused with the more common, yet noticeably larger Common and Harlequin Quails. They occur across southern Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and the northern and eastern regions of South Africa. While the birds in the eastern parts of southern Africa appear to be fairly sedentary, those from Namibia and Botswana seem to show some west-east nomadism, possibly in response to rainfall, irrupting at places in some years and then being absent in others.</p><p>Kurrichane Buttonquails are common in open savannas, but also use cultivated and fallow lands. They are small, inconspicuous birds, occurring singly or in pairs, but sometimes form loose groups in the non-breeding season. They prefer fairly tall, open grasslands which are not overly dense. Although reluctant to flush, this is when they are usually seen, or when found wandering on tiptoes down a sand road or path with strange jerky steps. After flushing, they fly a short distance and then land, for a brief moment adopting an upright posture with spread wings. They seldom flush twice. Undisturbed birds regularly dust-bathe, rubbing their body and neck in the sand, often extending their wings. The male’s call is a harsh, ‘tuc-tuc-tuc’ or raptor-like ‘kee-kee-kee’, while the female’s call, which often discloses their presence, is a repeated low-pitched hooting, ‘ummm..ummm..ummm’, with a deliberate break between the hoots. They usually feed in short grass and at the edges of roads, eating mostly insects and small seeds, especially grass seeds.</p><p>Kurrichane Buttonquails are common in open savannas, but also use cultivated and fallow lands.

They usually feed in short grass and at the edges of roads, eating mostly insects and small seeds, especially grass seeds.</p><p>Breeding can occur at any time of the year, particularly in the north, with a peak in late summer. Breeding birds are territorial, and the nest site is selected by the female, with the nest itself being a shallow scrape amongst grass tufts, sparsely lined with grass collected from nearby. The female uses her monotonous hooting, both by day and night, to attract a male. Thereafter, the pair bond is established with an elaborate courtship ritual around a potential nest scrape. Almost as in a trance, the male performs a dance with stiff movements and staring eyes, followed by throwing pieces of vegetation over his back. This can be repeated by the hen, which will also courtship-feed the male. Based on observations made in captivity, these birds have a very rare breeding strategy, called serial polyandry. When the clutch is complete, the male is the one who does the incubating, while the female starts the whole manhunt again and produces another clutch for a different male. A typical clutch contains 2-4 eggs, and incubation lasts about 15 days. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and are cared for and fed by the male. Chicks can fly at 10 days, and are fully grown at 35 days.</p><p>Although Kurrichane Buttonquails undertake local movements to take advantage of favourable conditions, they are potentially threatened by overgrazing, particularly during drought periods. However, in good years, because of the unusually prolific female reproductive strategy, breeding output can be high, which helps boost the population.</p>",

On holiday in Barberton, Mpumala&#173;nga province, equipped only with a pair of opera glasses (with one cracked and yellowed lens) and a copy of Gill’s AFirst Guide to South African Birds, I battled to identify a bird that habitually hunted in the late afternoon in the middle of a ploughed field adjacent to a Eucalyptplantation. The westering sun cast an orange glow over the field and made me wonder if the seeming orange colour of the bird’s flanks was genuine or not. Gill’s First Guide illustrates a rather dull-looking ‘Cape Thrush’ (as the Olive Thrush used to be called). It does not have a picture of the Kurrichane Thrush, and though it describes it in the text, it does not mention the diagnostic throat pattern. But a major problem was the ploughed field. I could not get close to the bird without it seeing me and flying off. So it remained a mystery bird for several weeks.</p><p>Today’s birders have much better guides and binoculars. Nevertheless, our thrushes can still prove tricky at times. African mainland thrushes of the genus Turdus form a complex of some nine or so species thatvary one from another by the amount of orange on the underparts, the intensity of colouration of the upperparts (blackish, brownish, or grey), and the presence or absence of throat markings. Some of them (like the Karoo Thrush) also exhibit eye-rings.</p><p>Today’s birders have much better guides and binoculars. Nevertheless, our thrushes can still prove tricky at times.

Some of them (like the Karoo Thrush) also exhibit eye-rings.</p><p>When Kurrichane or Olive Thrushes hop or run around (they use both gaits) on lawns, they are easy to observe. Nevertheless, even experienced birders get confused on occasion because some juvenile Olive Thrushes can exhibit distinct black malar stripes. Juvenile Kurrichane Thrushes have spotted underparts and have even been confused with Groundscraper Thrushes.</p><p>Most of the time, however, Olive and Kurrichane Thrushes are ecologically separated, the former originally occupying moist evergreen forest and the latter at home in drier woodlands. However, both may occupy altered habitats such as suburban gardens where the Kurrichane Thrush can become quite confiding. They forage in typical thrush style, a quick run, stop, listen, a quick peck to grab an earthworm (a favourite food item), or some leaf whisking to reveal other kinds of prey. They also like fruit and are known to eat small berries or to take beaksful of large fruits such as Avocado. They are particularly fond of fallen Mulberries, with colourful results, as many ringers have found out when handling them! They are also bold enough to attempt robbery of delectable items from other hunters. One was observed attempting unsuccessfully to rob a Pearl-spotted Owlet of a millipede, while another tried to take a paralysed spider from a Pompilid spider-hunting wasp. It also was unsuccessful, and got stung on its cheek by the irate wasp.</p><p>Kurrichane Thrushes like bathing and often visit birdbaths on a daily basis; if their usual bathing place is dry, they foliage-bathe after rain or on dewy mornings. Availability of surface water seems important to Kurrichane Thrushes because although usually sedentary, they move out of areas affected by drought. Like other Turdus thrushes they build a large, basin-shaped nest in the fork of a tree, usually at no great height above the ground. They seldom fly direct to the nest, typically landing in the canopy of the tree and running down a branch to reach the nest. And, of course, like all their kin, they are fine and versatile singers, pre-dawn (especially in bright moonlight), early morning, and in late afternoon-evening, with distinct phrases such as, for example, ‘reeyoo-weet-weet’ and ‘way-cheeyoo-wur-chick’, and many more.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The biggest falcon in the region, the Lanner Falcon, is a powerful bird with a striking appearance, and a demeanour to match it. It may be confused with the Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus in the field, although adults of the two species are markedly different in colouration and markings. In flight and from a distance, the Lanner has longer, broader wings, a longer tail, and a more slender body, showing more obvious neck and waist. It also has a much slower, deeper wingbeat, and is more inclined to soar, typically with its wings held slightly above the horizontal, with noticeable flexion in the tips of the primaries, and with its tail fanned widely. I find that the shape of the trailing edge of the wing is another useful feature – the Lanner has relatively longer secondaries than the Peregrine, so the trailing edge usually looks much straighter.</p><p>Like most falcons, the Lanner Falcon is a bird of open country. In southern Africa it occurs most commonly in grasslands and savannas, and adult pairs are generally associated with hilly or mountainous terrain where there are plenty of cliffs on which to nest. However, it is an adaptable species, which can pitch up just about anywhere and occur quite commonly under the right conditions (although a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests worrying decreases in Lanner numbers in parts of the region). It is not exclusively a cliff-nester, and will readily breed in old stick nests of other species – mainly of crows and raptors – built in trees or electricity pylons, and even on telephone poles next to the road. It also occurs quite regularly in urban areas, using tall buildings as surrogates for cliffs. There is a seasonally mobile or nomadic component to the Lanner population that is not fully understood. It seems to involve both off-season movements into productive areas which don’t generally support high numbers of breeding pairs – for example the southern Kalahari and the wheat fields of the south-western Cape – as well as sporadic incursions of breeding birds into otherwise arid areas after good rains.</p><p>Like most falcons, the Lanner Falcon is a bird of open country.

While it feeds mainly on birds, it is more inclined to go to ground than the Peregrine Falcon, and its diet can include quite large, terrestrial species such as gamebirds and korhaans. It is also a notorious chicken thief, and the highest breeding densities of the species in the region occur close to expansive rural settlements, where young, free-range chickens are available in abundance. The Lanner Falcon is a good rodent hunter, and I’ve seen them following tractors in farmland, catching gerbils as they are ploughed up out of the soil, and nabbing Ice Rats Otomys sloggetti as they stick their heads up out of the snow in the Drakensberg.</p><p>While it may be something of a jack of all trades, without the raw pace and flashing aerial dexterity of the Peregrine Falcon or the Taita Falcon Falco fasciinucha, the handsome Lanner Falcon is an impressive predator. I watched a pair one stormy winter’s evening on the top of the Lesotho escarpment, hunting Speckled Pigeons Columba guinea as they flew in to roost from feeding grounds in the lowlands. The conditions were abysmal, with the temperature well below freezing, but the Lanners were relentless, generating blistering speed into a strong wind, flying the pigeons in as they dived for cover on the cliffs. I couldn’t stay to see if they eventually caught one, but the performance they put on, as I sat slowly freezing in the dying light, was quite breathtaking.</p>",

In flight they show a distinctive pattern of white lines near the front edge of the wing, and a white streaked breast and belly with white on the thighs. The head is dwarfed by the huge bill, and the bird is distinguished by the folds of loose red skin on its head, from which it derives its name.</p><p>The large strong bill is put to excellent use when slitting open the skin of a carcass. Even a zebra’s skin is easily sliced open. Smaller vultures may have to await the arrival of this species to open up a carcass if the skin is thick. However, even with its huge bill this species cannot open the skin of an elephant or rhino. The birds will reach right into a carcass to get at food and, like most vultures, will go for a wash after a feeding session if there is water nearby. At midday on hot days they will join White-backed Vultures at pools to wash, and then stand on a nearby sandbank with wings spread out to dry.</p><p>The large strong bill is put to excellent use when slitting open the skin of a carcass.

They do have a longer wingspan than the Cape Vultures, but Cape Vultures have been weighed at over 10 kg, while the Lappet-faced Vulture weight seldom exceeds 8 kg. The Lappet-faced stands more upright, however, and thus appears to tower over the Cape Vultures at a carcass. These vultures are also very aggressive, and they regularly adopt a threatening demeanour at a carcass, bounding into the crowd of other vultures with lowered head, cocked tail and their wings held half-open in a horizontal position.</p><p>One does not realise just how big these birds are until, as happened to me, one is very close to the birds and at their level. I was sitting in a hide about 5 or 6 metres from an Impala carcass at which about 20 to 25 White-backed and three Hooded Vultures were feeding. A couple of Lappet-faced Vultures arrived and towered over the others and, in fact, when standing upright, the heads of these birds were actually higher than the roof of the hide in which I was sitting!  They were big enough to drive off all the other vultures and feed more or less on their own, though they would not have achieved this result at a bigger carcass.</p><p>These vultures are normally found in open woodlands in the drier regions of the northern half of southern Africa. However, they are also found in the open grassland areas of the Makgadikgadi in the Kalahari, as long as there are some trees within flight range where they can roost at night. They are not to be found over much of South Africa or Mozambique, nor in the well-wooded parts of Zimbabwe. At Gona-re-Zhou in the lowveld of Zimbabwe the birds nest on the top of quite short mopane trees, low enough for the nest to be examined using a mirror on a stick, but in other areas they prefer to use acacia trees if they are available. They build a huge basin-shaped nest, sometimes over two metres in diameter. Because it is placed in the centre top of an isolated tree, the branches make a halo around the nest and effectively hide it, despite the huge size. The basin in the middle is lined with grass, skin and similar matter.</p>",

There are only six Galerida larks, although one of these, the Crested Lark, is the second-most widespread lark in the world. A characteristic attribute of the genus is a prominent crest erected at the slightest provocation, and the generic name refers to this feature. Several Galerida species, but especially the Large-billed Lark, have robust beaks, which are used for digging for food, including subterranean bulbs. The bill of the Large-billed Lark is yellow at the base, and this distinguishes it from the large-billed forms of the Sabota Lark, with which it overlaps in distribution in some parts of the Karoo.</p><p>The Large-billed Lark was long known locally as the ‘Thick-billed Lark’ and there was irritation expressed in local quarters at the recent change in name. But these objections melt away in the face of any appreciation of the ‘real’ Thick-billed Lark Ramphocoris clotbey of North Africa, with its absurd facial appendage which even overshadows that of the Thick-billed Weaver. The local species was first made known to science from a figure and text by the famed François le Vaillant, who named it L’Alouette à Gros Bec, during his pioneering travels through the Cape in the 1740s at the very dawn of zoological exploration in southern Africa.</p><p>The Large-billed Lark was long known locally as the ‘Thick-billed Lark’ and there was irritation expressed in local quarters at the recent change in name.

Strangely, and unlike the majority of other Karoo birds, it barely extends north into Namibia and its range truncates sharply at the Orange River. This is despite broad expanses of apparently similar habitat in southern Namibia. There are two localities where it occurs widely outside the Karoo. The first is the cultivated pastures and cereal croplands in the Fynbos Biome of the Western Cape. The second is an even more interesting occurrence in the alpine grasslands of the Lesotho highlands, where it favours the very highest elevations. This presence of an essentially desert bird in the relatively high rainfall Lesotho mountains seems incongruous but the cool temperatures at these heights constrain the growth of vegetation in the same way aridity does in dry country. Although three subspecies of this lark have been admitted currently, the partially isolated Lesotho highlands population is ‘lumped’ in the same subspecies as the birds in the adjacent low-lying eastern Karoo regions with no clear differences apparently being obvious. This conclusion perhaps merits re-examination.</p><p>Wherever this chunky lark is found, its presence is typically revealed by its simple and idiosyncratic song which has been aptly likened to the sound of a squeaky farm gate. But it apparently can also be an accomplished mimic, and Gordon Maclean heard an individual just east of Bloemfontein covering up to 20 species in a sustained song bout, including bustards, lapwings, coursers, sandgrouse, shrikes, swallows, cisticolas, starlings, longclaws, pipits, sparrows and even other larks. But it would be nice to have independent confirmation of such aptitude, even though mimicry has been recorded in the other members of the genus.</p><p>The Large-billed Lark is sedentary but in the face of deep snowfall in the Lesotho highlands it is forced to temporarily flee to lower altitudes, and under such conditions I have seen an itinerant bird at the Sani Pass border post in South Africa, well into the Lower Berg of KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>Breeding is monogamous and territorial. The nest is a simple undomed cup built at ground level. The typical clutch is 2-3 eggs. Nestlings are brooded, shaded and fed by both sexes. When disturbed, adults at nests sometimes perform distraction displays and may even fly directly at human intruders.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This small seed-eating bird is the ultimate ‘Little Brown Job’ with no distinctive plumage features, and as a result it tends to get overlooked by all but the most observant of birders! It lacks the characteri&#173;stic head pattern of other buntings, and its brown colours are muted. In the hand, the plumage is remarkably soft, possibly providi&#173;ng good insulation during the cold desert nights. The heartland of the Lark-like Bunting is the arid west, from the deserts of Namibia south into the Karoo, often in open and virtually treeless areas. It appears to be highly nomadic – at least no-one has suggested that there is any regular pattern to this bird’s movements. It is sometimes common in the Mountain Zebra National Park and mist-netted regularly at water points, but is completely absent at other times. In one drought year, walking on farms just north of Grahamstown one was constantly flushing birds, but it was ten years before they re-appeared there. Flocks may associate with sparrow-larks and canaries, feeding on grass seeds. Lark-like Buntings drink regularly where water is available, but it is not clear how dependent they are on water.</p><p>A bird-ringer who regularly visits the same farm in Namibia has noted that when large numbers of Lark-like Buntings are present, many of them are juvenile birds.  If conditions are favourable after good rains, they may stay for several months, and then birds are recaptured at the original ringing site within the same year. They may also disappear abruptly, and one bird was recaptured 200 km away only a week after ringing. At times the dense, noisy flocks may number tens of thousands, reminiscent of Red-billed Queleas, and perhaps like this species, the Lark-like Bunting may follow a ‘boom or bust’ strategy, breeding prolifically when the going is good, and then suffering high mortality during drought periods, when they also show irruptive movements to areas well outside their normal range. However, we lack sufficient information on individual birds to be able to estimate survival rates, or the range over which the flocks may move. Apart from their nomadic habits, these birds occur in areas where ornithologists rarely undertake research, and observers only turn up as occasional visitors.</p><p>A bird-ringer who regularly visits the same farm in Namibia has noted that when large numbers of Lark-like Buntings are present, many of them are juvenile birds.

Breeding is monogamous, although we do not know whether or not pairs stay together for more than one breeding attempt. The nests are shallow cups of grass and twigs, lined with fine grass, apparently built by the female without assistance from the male. The female is also responsible for incubation, but the roles of the sexes in feeding the young apparently have not been studied. Nests are usually well spaced out though many birds may nest in the same general area. They are placed on the ground in scrubby or rocky areas, and nesting success is low, with up to 96% of the nests destroyed by predators. Studies in the Northern Cape have shown that snakes and small carnivores like the yellow mongoose are major predators of birds nesting on or close to the ground. Possibly the large numbers of Lark-like Buntings breeding in synchrony may ‘flood’ the local predators, ensuring that some nests survive.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Laughing Dove is widely distributed in Africa, Arabia, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and India, and has been introduced to parts of the Middle East and Algeria – in fact is probably one of the most widely distributed dove species in the world. South of the Sahara Desert, it occurs from West Africa east to Ethiopia and Somalia, and from there south to South Africa. The distribution is patchy in parts of southern Africa, and the birds seem to avoid the hyperarid areas unless there is surface water.</p><p>Their natural habitat is open woodlands, including drainage-line woodland and open woodland in Acacia savanna. They are present, but less common, in broad-leaved woodlands. Today, however, parks, gardens and croplands are probably their primary habitat and, in the Karoo, they are common in villages and in disturbed habitats around farmhouses. In the Western Cape they also make use of thickets of alien Port Jackson Willow Acacia saligna and Rooikrans A. cyclops.

Relative to the densities that these birds reach in man-altered habitats, today they are rare in natural habitats.</p><p>In six years of once-weekly bird counts in drainage-line woodland in the southern Karoo, no Laughing Doves were recorded in the woodland, but they were recorded regularly at a farmstead only 2 km from the study site. Similarly, no Laughing Doves were seen in fairly undisturbed woodlands north and east of Upington, but they were common in the irrigation farms along the Orange River.</p><p>Laughing Doves forage by walking about on open ground, pecking up seeds. In many cases these are the tiny seeds of grasses, sedges and of wild figs when the fruits have been crushed on roads. A wide range of seeds is eaten, both in size and species. The birds’ diet also includes small dry and juicy fruits, small rhizomes and bulbs of sedges, nectar of aloes, and termites, ants, fly larvae and pupae, and small snails. Laughing Doves drink water regu&#173;larly, usually in the early and late parts of the day, seldom during midday. The birds arrive at desert water holes singly, in pairs or small groups, and perch on trees until a number of doves have gathered. The birds then cautiously start to fly down to drink, and after many false alarms, become less cautious and settle down to drink. Each bird spends only a few seconds drinking. Similar cautious behaviour is shown by Laughing Doves at suburban bird baths and bird feeders. Like all doves they can suck water into the throat without having to lift the head to swallow, so are able to drink rapidly.</p><p>When nesting, Laughing Doves are monogamous, territorial, and the nests are solitary. Courtship displays are ritualised and follow a similar pattern to displays in all doves and pigeons. Pairing is probably for life and territories are probably permanent. The nest is built by the female, using material brought by the male. The nest is a simple and frail platform of twigs, leaf petioles and roots. Nests are placed in a wide variety of sites, from horizontal branches to eaves, rafters of buildings, window boxes and other artificial sites, but more than 99% are in trees. The eggs are incubated by both sexes. The nestlings leave the nest at about 12 or 13 days old: at this time they are almost flightless and appear to be extremely vulnerable. They remain at or near the nest for a few more days, returning to the nest area less and less often as their flying skills develop. &#9;</p>",

The species is a common resident on rocky hills, such as outcrops of Dwyka tillite, tumbled boulders of Witteberg quartzite at the bases of the mountains, and shale ridges in the Succulent and Nama Karoo. They also occur in dry montane shrubland and arid fynbos fairly high in the mountains of the southern Karoo, and are found at even higher elevations in the Drakensberg along the Lesotho/KwaZulu-Natal border.</p><p>The birds are usually alone or in pairs, never in groups. They are not easily flushed, tending to remain inside the undergrowth, but they are inquisitive. Nevertheless, in gardens they seem less curious and almost always keep their distance. Layard’s Tit-Babblers are quite conspicuous and vocal in the breeding season, calling from bushes or large boulders, or while flying between bushes, sometimes snapping their wings in flight.</p><p>The birds are usually alone or in pairs, never in groups.

Layard’s Tit-Babblers are quite conspicuous and vocal in the breeding season, calling from bushes or large boulders, or while flying between bushes, sometimes snapping their wings in flight.</p><p>Although mostly resident in the Karoo, the birds move in some winters to lower-lying drainage lines, and particularly into gardens adjacent to their rocky habitats. In the higher, and colder parts of their distribution range, the birds regularly migrate down the escarpment in winter. The occurrence in lower-lying drainage lines and gardens, however, is unpredictable – the birds appear in these places in some years, but not in others. At times Layard’s Tit-Babblers and Chestnut-vented Tit-Babblers occur in Karoo gardens together, but do not interact.</p><p>The breeding biology of Layard’s Tit-Babbler is similar to the Chestnut-vented Tit-Babbler, but nest sites and nesting habitat are very different. Layard’s Tit-Babblers nest on rocky koppies in the Karoo, sometimes in the only sizeable Karoo Gold or Granaat Rhigozum obovatum bush on the hillside. The nest is a thin-walled cup of silky fibres from the bark of the reed-like Lammerlat Gomphocarpus filifolius and grass, bound with spider web. Lammerlat does not grow on rocky hills, and is a very frequently used material in Layard’s Tit-Babbler nests, so the birds must often travel some distance from the nest site to the Lammerlat bushes growing in moist patches on the flats below. The birds are very wary when nesting, not only when carrying food to feed nestlings, but also when incubating. Birds carrying food frequently dive into concealing vegetation or go behind boulders, and are adept at emerging unseen. Nestlings are fed by both adults, disproportionately more frequently by the female when the nestlings are small.</p><p>Layard’s Tit-Babblers forage low down in bushes and shrubs, mostly gleaning from leaves and stems. Their food includes insects and small fruits such as honey-thorns or wolwedorings (Lycium) and Namaqua Rock Figs Ficus cordata. The invertebrate component of their diet includes grasshoppers, termites, beetles, moths and butterflies, caterpillars, bugs (Hemiptera), weevils (Curculionidae) and ants. &#9;</p>",

There are only two records from outside the Pacific Ocean, both in the south-west Indian Ocean: one just inside South African territorial waters off Cape Agulhas in April 1983 and one north of the Crozets in December 1984. The bulk of the population breeds in the north-west Hawaiian Islands, foraging mainly in temperate waters to the north of the islands. It is listed as Near-threatened following steady decreases in key populations since 1990, apparently linked to accidental mortality on fishing gear. The steady accumulation of plastic litter in the North Pacific has resulted in birds consuming large amounts of litter at sea, some of which they pass on to their chicks. This reduces the amount of space in the stomach for food, is a source of toxic compounds, and in extreme cases can damage or block the digestive tract, killing the chick.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>As its scientific name implies, the Lazy Cisticola is indeed aberrant or unusual, and in terms of its habitat and behaviour this species differs considerably from other cisticolas. Its common name is said to be derived from the fact that it lacks an aerial display flight, or that it is difficult to put to flight, instead spending much of its day creeping about on the ground and seldom flying any great distance.</p><p>Perusing my first dog-eared field guide as a child, I was intrigued by the Lazy Cisticola, mostly because of its creative name. I first became acquainted with this species in South Africa’s Waterberg, a picturesque landscape of towering cliffs, secluded streams, mature woodland and much potential for discovery. Unknown to me at the time, much of the Waterberg also provides perfect Lazy Cisticola habitat: scrub-choked ravines, tumbles of boulders interspersed with grass and shrubbery, and steep, rocky slopes cloaked in broken woodland. Consequently, the area supports an unusually high density of these unobtrusive cisticolas, and it wasn’t long before I tracked their moaning, bleating calls to its origin.</p><p>Perusing my first dog-eared field guide as a child, I was intrigued by the Lazy Cisticola, mostly because of its creative name.

Consequently, the area supports an unusually high density of these unobtrusive cisticolas, and it wasn’t long before I tracked their moaning, bleating calls to its origin.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Lazy Cisticola is also found in ferns, tangled grass and other thickets at forest edges, in the scrubby verges of alien plantations, in liberally vegetated valleys and even in suburban gardens. In Zimbabwe, they show a strong preference for that country’s emblematic rock outcrops, habitat islands in a sea of miombo woodland: here they are found in the grassy understorey of light woodland surrounding the balancing rocks.</p><p>One will almost invariably hear this species before it is seen. It gives a wide range of simple sounds, but lacks a distinctive song. Most often heard is a loud, wailing, complaining moan that can be quite unsettling when frantically repeated by an alarmed family party. A variety of repetitive clicks, bell-like notes, quick rattles and sharp, explosive sounds are produced in different contexts.</p><p>The Lazy Cisticola is usually found in pairs or small parties, and a number of birds tend to appear and respond to the call to arms when their territorial limits are breached. Especially when agitated, they constantly keep their tails cocked upward or raised vertically. This behavioural quirk helps distinguish this species from most other cisticolas, but may lead to confusion with prinias. When calling, the birds usually climb onto large rocks or flutter into the canopy of small trees, but before long they descend back to the ground to resume foraging. Their prey consists primarily of insects, which are sought by hopping or running about on rocks, creeping rodent-like amongst grasses, or inspecting cracks and crevices. Because of the plumage wear resulting from their partly terrestrial lifestyles, the birds’ tails quickly become worn and tatty, often with only the central quill remaining towards the tail tip.</p><p>The taxonomy of this species has been in flux at various times in the past: previously, all populations across the continent were considered to belong to a single, wide-ranging species. Most authorities now recognise two distinct groups: a southern population that extends as far north as Malawi, and a disjunct northern popu&#173;lation with an extensive but highly fragmented range in East and West Africa. In most modern classifications, this latter group is now considered a different species, Rock-loving Cisticola C. emini.</p><p>Within southern Africa, three subspecies of the Lazy Cisticola are recognised: the nominate C. a. abberans occurs widely in the former Transvaal, grading into the slightly smaller and paler C. a. minor of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The isolated, Zimbabwean C. a. nyika differs from populations south of the Limpopo in its voice and habitat, as well as its more distinctly mottled mantle and the bolder pattern on its tail tip. &#9;</p>",

This is the only known breeding population in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the only procellariiform known to breed in sub-Saharan Africa. One Leach’s Storm Petrel was caught in a mist net on Dassen Island in 1971, but the species was only discovered breeding on South African islands in the 1990s; whether it was overlooked before then, or only recently colonised the islands is unclear. They are nocturnal and breed in crevices among rocks or in small burrows among dense vegetation, making them easy to overlook, but their strange, haunting calls at night should have drawn some comment. It was first discovered breeding on Dyer Island, but is now most common on Dassen Island.</p><p>In appearance, it superficially resembles the more common Wilson’s Storm Petrel, but has a forked tail, longer, more slender wings, and a narrower white rump that often has a faint dark line down the centre. Its flight action is quite different; the wings are angled and bowed at the wrist, and it glides more, making less frequent, deep, languid wing beats. They are fairly common off Namibia, but are seldom seen over the continental shelf off South Africa. However, it is the commonest storm petrel beyond the shelf break off South Africa in summer, and often is the most common bird in oceanic waters in summer. It often forms small rafts with Great-winged Petrels, roosting on the water in calm weather. Migrants arrive in November and most depart by the end of April. They often appear scruffy as they moult while in our waters.

The small local breeding population also breeds in summer; it is not known whether they remain in our waters in winter.</p><p>Like all Procellariiformes, this species lays a single egg which is large relative to the size of the bird. Incubation is protracted, lasting around 40 days, but the egg can survive temporary abandonment, so it may take up to 50 days for an egg to hatch. Both parents incubate, changing over every 1-5 days. The newly hatched chick is covered in down, but is brooded for the first five days or so. Thereafter both adults forage, bringing food back to the chick at night, feeding it a mix of semi-digested crustaceans, fish and squid, well lubricated by stomach oils. The chick uses the threat of regurgitating these stomach oils to deter would-be avian predators. The chick grows quite rapidly, reaching up to twice adult mass by the time it is eight weeks old. Much of this extra mass is in the form of stored water and lipids to tide the chick over should its parents both remain away for a protracted period. The chick fledges 9-10 weeks after hatching, obtaining no further support from its parents.</p><p>The global population is more than eight million breeding pairs and it is not globally threatened. However, it is listed as Endangered on the South Africa Red Data list due to its small population size and impacts of introduced predators such as cats on some breeding islands. Barn Owls, which disperse to the islands sporadically, appear to pose the greatest threat to adults. A single owl can virtually wipe out an island’s population. Kelp Gulls also pose a significant threat, although the storm petrels limit their exposure by only commuting to and from their nests on dark nights when there is no moon.</p>",

They sometimes forage in deep shade under dense undergrowth. Their food is not well known in southern Africa, but does include tubers of ground orchids, bamboo seeds, and fallen fruits of yellowwoods (Podocarpus species), Wild Peach Kiggelaria africana, Cape Chestnut Calodendrum capense, Forest Ironplum Drypetes gerrardii and Fluted Milkwood Chrysophyllum viridiflorum. They also eat invertebrates, including termites and predatory snails (Gullela species).</p><p>When not calling, Lemon Doves are easily overlooked in their forest habitat, their presence revealed only when they fly up and dash away, dropping into cover after a short flight. Their navigation on these dashing flights is sometimes not as good as it should be, and after being disturbed while foraging, the birds frequently flew into windows of my cottage in the forest at Sedgefield.</p><p>The birds are monogamous, solitary nesters, likely to be territorial. The courtship display has not been recorded. The nest is a frail (occasionally substantial) platform of twigs and rootlets, built by both sexes and usually placed about 2.5 metres above the ground on a horizontal branch, sometimes in the lower midcanopy of a small tree, and sometimes in vines and creepers. My limited experience of nests is that they were always on the tips of branches at the edges of clearings, but most nests appear to have been in sites in deep shade. There is one record of a nest built on the frond of a cycad (Encephalartos species): this site was used in several successive years. Only the female incubates the eggs, and she sits very tight indeed. The nestling period is about 20 days, and the young remain with their parents for at least two months after leaving the nest.</p><p>The species is not threatened, although the increasing use of understorey plants for medicinal purposes is a cause for concern – populations of Lemon Doves in some places are thought to have decreased.&#9;</p>",

The filtering lamellae in the Lesser Flamingo’s bill are very fine, designed to capture clumps of cyanobacteria (so-called blue-green algae) and large diatoms, which are filtered from close to the water surface or just above the bottom.

Because they feed from the water surface, they often swim, skimming the surface waters by scything their heads from side to side.</p><p>Despite favouring wetlands with high concentrations of cyanobacteria, the great disparity in body size between Lesser Flamingos and their cyanobacteria prey requires the flamingos to spend many hours feeding each day to obtain enough food, and they often feed at night. They typically occur at saltpans, soda lakes and eutrophicated wetlands, including sewage works. The settling pans at Cape Town’s Strandfontein Sewage Works used to attract up to 20 000 birds each summer in the 1970s, but their numbers dwindled following installation of a primary treatment plant that reduced the amounts of nutrients entering the pans. The species is now seldom found at this site.</p><p>Like the Greater Flamingo, this species undertakes irregular movements to exploit ephemeral habitats. They usually travel at night, but such flocks are sometimes seen during the day well outside their normal range, such as over Zimbabwe’s Eastern Highlands. Large influxes in southern Africa coincide with decreases in the East African population, suggesting regular exchange between the two regions. They occasionally wander to Madagascar, and one bird from Kenya was recovered more than 6 000 kilometres away in the western Sahara.</p><p>Lesser Flamingos breed in very dense colonies at inland saltpans and soda lakes. The only regularly used breeding localities in Africa are at Etosha Pan, Namibia, Sua Pan, Botswana, and Lake Natron, in Kenya. However, breeding commenced at Kamfer’s Dam outside Kimberley in 2007, following the formation of a custom-designed island in the dam by a local mining company. Over the following four years, some 24 000 chicks fledged at this site, but changes in the volume of municipal run-off entering the dam then resulted in the island being inundated, and breeding no longer occurs there. Up to 80 000 pairs breed at Sua Pan in good years. However, if the breeding pan dries out before the chicks fledge large numbers can starve to death. In 1969, some 80 000 chicks died at Etosha. Walvis Bay is the most important non-breeding site, supporting up to 43 000 birds in winter and 28 000 in summer.</p><p>The African population is estimated to be roughly 4 million birds, but all three breeding sites are threatened by mining and water abstraction, and flamingo numbers are decreasing. In East Africa, diseases such as avian tuberculosis cause die-offs of thousands of birds in some years, but such events have not been recorded in southern Africa. They also are often killed when they collide with powerlines. This risk can be reduced by marking lines close to wetlands to make them more visible, but flamingos also strike lines far from water during their nocturnal migrations.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Of the two Palaearctic shrikes visiting southern Africa this is the less well known in its winter quarters, mostly frequenting the drier and less populated regions of Namibia and Botswana although it is also found in the northern part of South Africa and Zimbabwe, in the latter most widely during northward migration. Southward vagrancy into the Eastern and Western Cape also occurs. The breeding range extends from northern Spain through southern Europe east to about 90°E, and the entire population winters in southern Africa where the population is considered to number between 5 and 10 million birds. There has been a continuous decline in numbers in Western Europe since the 19th century, and this is thought to be occasioned by changing climatic factors with lower summer temperatures and heavier rainfall being unsuitable for successful breeding. These breeding requirements are reflected in the non-breeding quarters, hence their preference for the drier west. The core of its southern range is the Kalahari Basin where it is typical of open Acacia savanna and where it has less or no competition from the Fiscal Shrike.</p><p>Birds leave Eurasia from late August but stage at sites further north in Africa, only arriving in our area from late October until December. Arrival in an area is usually in synchrony with rainfall, and the distribution in any one year is dependent to a great degree on where the rains actually fall. Patchy rainfall usually creates a patchy occurrence amongst most insectivorous migrant visitors. In years of widespread drought there must be considerable mortality amongst these insectivorous birds and probably an eastwards shift in general distribution. The southward migration occurs further west, passing through western Zambia and there is then a partial loop migration as many birds return north further east, and it is at this time that the bird is much more frequently seen in Zimbabwe. Return migration occurs mainly during March and April. It has been found to occasionally spend the austral winter as far south as Zambia.</p><p>Birds leave Eurasia from late August but stage at sites further north in Africa, only arriving in our area from late October until December.

Where it and the Red-backed Shrike occur together the latter is dominated by the larger species and spends more time skulking in bushes, and so one can drive through large tracts of country thinking that the smaller species is almost absent. If the Red-backed does dare show itself prominently then it is soon chased back into cover, and often right through a bush and out the other side. This shrike also penetrates deeper into the Namib Desert than its congener, especially when some light rainfall has occurred there to stimulate insect life. Here they perch conspicuously on any small bits of low straggly vegetation. In Zimbabwe they also use telephone poles and may dominate the resident Fiscal Shrikes.</p><p>Catching these birds during mist-netting can be a painful experience as they have one of the nastiest bites of any bird handled, so great care need be taken. However, being a solitary species with a largish feeding territory few are ever caught. In a well-bushed, large Namibian garden studied, only one bird was likely to be found whereas Red-backed Shrike were much more frequent although maintaining a low profile.</p>",

The rest of the Lesser Honeyguide’s diet is made up of insects, hawked in flight or gleaned from leaves, twigs and bark.</p><p>As can be seen from the photograph, this is a rather drab-looking bird, with only the white-edged outer tail feathers attracting attention when it takes flight. Male and female look alike, but (fortunately for birders) the male is ‘vocally conspicuous’, advertising his presence daily and throughout the year, from a favoured ‘song post’. His song is a series of notes, ‘chink, chink, chink, chink…’, sounding almost metallic, like a blacksmith tapping with a small hammer. The song is comparatively loud for a bird not much bigger than a sparrow, and is delivered in strings of 15 to 40 notes. The term ‘song post’ should not be taken to mean a single perch. The Lesser Honeyguide male’s post in our village is a line of several large poplar trees alongside the river. The bird calls from many positions and can be hard to locate, even in winter when the trees are leafless. When some of the trees’ larger limbs overhanging a homestead were cut off, the honeyguide departed, but returned over a week later and started calling again.</p><p>Like other members of its family, the Lesser Honeyguide is a brood parasite and most of its confirmed hosts in southern Africa are barbets, although Little Bee-eaters are regular hosts in Zimbabwe. Several other species, including wood-hoopoes, woodpeckers and starlings are suspected of being hosts. The species has expanded its range into the southwestern Cape comparatively recently (first breeding recorded in 1985), following an earlier expansion into this previously ‘barbet-less’ region by Acacia Pied Barbets in the 1960s.</p><p>Barbets do not meekly accept their Lesser Honeyguide parasites. The Black-collared Barbet is the most common host of the Lesser Honeyguide in southern Africa, and in the classic ‘arms race’ tradition it has developed some behavioural traits to counter the honeyguide. These include a special warning call when a honeyguide is seen in the vicinity of the nest hole, and co-ordinated occupancy of the nest hole by one or other mate to render it dangerous for the female honeyguide to attempt to enter the hole and lay her egg. The Lesser Honeyguides, in turn, attempt to counter this defence using decoy behaviour by the male, who may flutter to and fro in front of the nest hole, tempting the occupant and his or her mate to pursue it and leave the entrance unguarded. But once the honeyguide’s egg is deposited in the clutch and hatches, the die is cast. The honeyguide chick will kill its nest mates, and the barbets will end up raising a honeyguide.&#9;</p>",

From a birding perspective, the presence of a kestrel roost adds a much-needed dose of seasonal character to many otherwise birding-poor little Karoo or Highveld ‘dorps’. In fact, the towns which host the really big roosts – sometimes in excess of 10 000 birds – are treated to nothing less than a bona fide spectacle of the natural world, each and every summer evening, as the sky above darkens under a seething cloud of skittish kestrels. The birds wheel around in the dying light, and only really settle in their roost trees right at the last moment, rapidly and miraculously disappearing into the foliage. The next morning, the exodus back into the foraging lands starts slowly, with a few birds here, and a few there, until suddenly the majority decide to move, and virtually the entire roost empties in only one or two roaring surges of fluttering wings, as hungry kestrels head, often in just about every direction, for the day’s hunting.</p><p>Until recently, the Lesser Kestrel was classed as globally Vulnerable because of significant decreases in numbers and breeding success during the latter half of the 20th century. These declines were attributed to a variety of factors, of which the most important was probably habitat loss to the spread of intensive agriculture, afforestation and urbanisation. After a concerted and evidently successful research and conservation campaign, the situation seems to have stabilised, and the Lesser Kestrel is safely back from the brink.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Among the yellow-plu&#173;maged weavers in our region, the male Lesser Masked Weaver is distinctive in breeding dress, with an extensive black mask and pale eye. Females and juveniles are much smaller than any of the other pale-eyed weaver species in southern Africa, and this is one of the few weavers in which the legs and feet are blue-grey, rather than brown or pinkish. Small groups forage in the tree canopies, searching for insects and drinking nectar. They also eat flowers, fruit and small seeds, but unlike many other savanna weavers this is not primarily a granivorous bird. In the non-breeding period when insects are less common, Lesser Masked Weavers commonly flock with other species, in particular with Red-billed Queleas – perhaps because these two species are similar in size.</p><p>Lesser Masked Weavers are colonial, with several hundred nests in many colonies. In the lowveld they generally nest in large thorn trees along rivers, and a single tree can hold more than one hundred nests. These birds are a familiar sight at many rest camps in the Kruger National Park, where they nest in thorn trees close to the buildings, and wait to be fed by tourists. Their population within the park has been estimated at several hundred thousand adult birds. They may also form mixed colonies, particularly with Village Weavers, and sometimes with Southern Masked Weavers, Yellow Weavers, Thick-billed Weavers and Red-billed Queleas.</p><p>Lesser Masked Weavers are colonial, with several hundred nests in many colonies.

Displays are centred on the nest, with the male hanging below it, fanning his wings, spreading his tail, and singing. Nests are built by the male from strips of grass, reed or palm leaves, with a short entrance tunnel pointing downwards. In one case a nest was constructed entirely from pine needles. The nests usually are suspended from the tip of a branch, reed or papyrus frond, up to three metres above the ground or the water surface. However, they also nest on buildings, where nests hang from the eaves or from telephone lines. There are records of birds nesting close to paper wasps, and where nests are clustered together they may even be attached to each other. Nest-building often starts soon after the first rains, but may be abandoned again if there is no follow-up rainfall. Once a female has accepted a nest, she may add lining material, but this is often sparse compared to other weavers, and the eggs may be visible through the nest bowl. The female is entirely responsible for incubation, and does most of the feeding of the nestlings, although the male may contribute, feeding about half as often as the female.</p><p>Lesser Masked Weavers are regular hosts of Dideric Cuckoos, though only a small proportion of the nests are parasitised. Nest predators have a more significant impact on reproduction; these include African Fish Eagles, snakes and Vervet Monkeys. The colony areas are deserted in the non-breeding season, but records from ringed birds suggest that they do not disperse very far. The oldest wild bird reported so far was at least nine years old, although individuals have lived up to 19 years in captivity. Escaped cage birds are reported to have nested in both Germany and Japan.</p>",

How the Lesser Moorhens find these transient wetlands just when they are in the right state to support feeding and breeding birds is not clear, but is one of the admirable traits of the species. Their distribution in southern Africa is variable in both time and space, since it is dependent on erratic rainfall. During summers of high rain, Lesser Moorhens are irruptive and widespread, arriving from north of our borders within days of heavy downpours. Conversely, during years of below-average rainfall, their numbers and range are much reduced. The only constant is that they are found mainly north of latitude 26° South.</p><p>Once they have arrived in southern Africa, the presence of Lesser Moorhens is usually revealed by the clucking, chuckling, and clicking calls which emanate from the dense flooded vegetation, since they call throughout the day and night at the commencement of breeding. A glut of aquatic invertebrates and plants, which comprise the diet of this species, ensures that they build up condition quickly before they start egg-laying. When conditions are optimal, they are prolific breeders, with large clutches of up to nine eggs being produced, and they are sometimes double-brooded.</p><p>Once they have arrived in southern Africa, the presence of Lesser Moorhens is usually revealed by the clucking, chuckling, and clicking calls which emanate from the dense flooded vegetation, since they call throughout the day and night at the commencement of breeding.

In the last few years, however – and like many other species – there is some evidence that a westward range extension is occurring through the coastal lowlands of the Western Cape.</p><p>Throughout southern African it commonly occurs alongside the Greater Striped Swallow, and the two species build neighbouring nests at some sites. It is a faster and more agile flyer than the Greater Striped Swallow, but mixes with it and other swallows during aerial foraging, particularly when hatches of ant or termite alates or chironomid flies generate clouds of insects. Lesser Striped Swallows regularly exploit the ‘beating’ effect of grazing animals such as domestic cattle, and they are attracted to grass fires for the same reason.</p><p>Throughout southern African it commonly occurs alongside the Greater Striped Swallow, and the two species build neighbouring nests at some sites.

Lesser Striped Swallows regularly exploit the ‘beating’ effect of grazing animals such as domestic cattle, and they are attracted to grass fires for the same reason.</p><p>These swallows are less apt to breed in suburbs and cities than the Greater Striped Swallow, but their numbers appear to be increasing, due likely to the increasing number of nesting sites made available by man-made structures. They are subject to the same appropriation of their nests by White-rumped Swifts and Mocking Chats.</p><p>In order to build a nest, a source of damp mud has to be available within about 500&#160;m of a chosen nest site, otherwise the energy expended in fetching and carrying becomes too great. The late Dr C. J. Skead, who undertook a 50-year-long study of the birds of the Eastern Cape, counted 1&#160;149 mud pellets collected by a building pair, but considered it an underestimate. Nevertheless, the figure indicates the effort these swallows invest when building a nest, and some of them manage it in as little as 24 days.</p><p>Nests attached to corrugated iron roofs commonly collapse on a seasonal basis, which means that the swallows have to rebuild at the start of each breeding season. Furthermore, the high temperature inside a nest under an iron roof can be fatal to chicks in very hot weather. Verandas with ceilings are much favoured because they are cooler, while in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape thatch-roofed houses and huts have become popular sites for these swallows.</p><p>The popularity of thatch for nesting was evident in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve rest camp in 1959-60. The under-eave portion of the thatched rest camp office, on the undisturbed east-facing wall, was packed with Lesser Striped Swallow nests. This goes against the belief that the species does not nest colonially in southern Africa, although it does so in Zambia and Angola. When the young birds emerged on their first flights, there were scores of swallows fluttering and wheeling around the nests in the late afternoons, and one wondered how individual fledglings knew which tunnel entrance to choose when returning ‘home’. The answer was provided when I saw a presumed parent flying just above a youngster, reach down with its feet, clutch the youngster’s mantle feathers, and guide it directly to one of the tunnels.</p><p>Not everyone, however, appreciates having these swallows as guests. Some householders regularly destroy the nests, objecting to the mess they make on the floor beneath. Young chicks initially defecate in the nest, and the faecal sacs are removed by the parents and dropped 20 metres or more away. When the chicks are older, however, they reverse along the tunnel and defecate out of the entrance.</p>",

The reasons for the Lesser Swamp Warbler’s familiarity are manifold: with the exception of the most arid zones such as the Namib and Kalahari, it occurs virtually throughout the region; it is present year-round; it has loud and unmistakable vocalisations; and finally, it can be bold, confiding and even downright inquisitive.</p><p>As both this species’ current name and previous name of Cape Reed Warbler imply, it is restricted to well-vegetated wetlands. Extensive stands of reeds and bulrushes in marshes, along streams and rivers, and at coastal estuaries, lakes, dams and sewage works are its typical haunts. However, it can sometimes be found in surprisingly small and isolated pockets of aquatic vegetation. In optimal conditions it may occur at very high local densities with adjacent nests located only five to ten metres apart. It is also quick to discover newly created habitat; this pioneering trait has allowed it to extend its natural range into more arid areas, where boreholes, canals and dams provide novel habitats.</p><p>As both this species’ current name and previous name of Cape Reed Warbler imply, it is restricted to well-vegetated wetlands.

The scattered and fragmented distribution pattern typical of waterbirds is evident, with distinct linear concentrations along major rivers such as the Gariep and Vaal; its apparent abundance around major cities is a reflection of both increased observers and much suitably modified habitat around population centres.</p><p>The diet of the Lesser Swamp Warbler consists primarily of insects and other small invertebrates, although its long and slender but powerful bill (described by its scientific name) also allows it to subdue larger prey, such as small frogs. The birds hunt by sidling up and down reed stems or hopping about on vegetation, and spend most of their time near the water’s surface. They remain obscured in dense cover but sometimes emerge to explore exposed areas, including reed-bed edges, lily pads, floating vegetation, algae mats and occasionally leaf litter, trees and bushes, lawns and open mud. In an extreme case, I once came across a pair of Lesser Swamp Warblers searching for washed-up insects along the shore of a large dam – more than 100 m away from the nearest reeds.</p><p>Despite its relatively audacious nature, the Lesser Swamp Warbler would dishonour the warbler name if it wasn’t more often heard than seen. Its song is fairly simple but rich, atmospheric and pleasing, and seems to fit perfectly with waterside habitats. It consists of a variable series of chuckling, bubbling and trilling phrases given at intervals. It sings throughout the day, and several birds often sing together in an overlapping chorus.</p><p>The Lesser Swamp Warbler is considered to be resident in most of its range – as one would conclude from its relatively short, rounded wings and weak, fluttering flight low over the water’s surface. Nevertheless, ringing has demonstrated that some birds do undertake local seasonal movements, apparently at night.</p><p>Breeding may occur in any month, but peaks in spring in the Western Cape and early summer elsewhere. The nest, which is constructed by the female alone, is a deep, sturdy cone or cup, woven with strips of dead vegetation. It is slung between 2-3 vertical stems to which it is attached with neat ‘handles’. Some nests are fairly conspicuous but most are concealed in dense vegetation, usually 0.2-1.2 m above the water’s surface. The 2-3 heavily spotted eggs are incubated by both sexes for about two weeks, and the chicks leave the nest 10-14 days after hatching.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This familiar wetland dweller is named after François le Vaillant (1753-1824), a French naturalist beloved by the public but often scorned by his peers. Born in Suriname in northern South America, le Vaillant spent his teens in France before setting off to South Africa, and a consequent series of adventures, on orders of the Dutch East India Company. Between 1781 and 1784, he collected thousands of specimens in the Cape Town, Saldanha Bay and Namaqualand regions before returning to Paris and producing a series of popular, partly factual, partly exaggerated and fictitious memoirs of his travels. Despite being vigorously opposed to Linnaeus’s binomial naming system (assigning each species a two-part scientific name, as is still in use today) several bird species are named after him in this fashion, including Red-winged Francolin Scleroptila levaillantii, Levaillant’s Cuckoo Oxylophus levaillantii and Crested Barbet Trachyphonus vaillantii.</p><p>Levaillant’s Cisticola is abundant across most of South Africa (apart from the dry north-west), Lesotho and western Swaziland, as well as in areas above 1&#160;200 metres in central Zimbabwe. Although it occurs commonly in coastal wetlands from the Western Cape to Richard’s Bay, it is replaced on the Zululand coast, as well as in the lowveld and Mozambique, by the subtropical Rufous-winged Cisticola.</p><p>Levaillant’s Cisticola is abundant across most of South Africa (apart from the dry north-west), Lesotho and western Swaziland, as well as in areas above 1&#160;200 metres in central Zimbabwe. Although it occurs commonly in coastal wetlands from the Western Cape to Richard’s Bay, it is replaced on the Zululand coast, as well as in the lowveld and Mozambique, by the subtropical Rufous-winged Cisticola.</p><p>Throughout its range Levaillant’s Cisticola is strongly associated with wetlands, breeding in tangled grassland or weeds near water, in swathes of sedges, at the edges of reed beds, along streams and rivers or near the shorelines of pans, lakes, dams and estuaries. It is seldom found far from water, but may sometimes be encountered in lush irrigated fields, rank grassland on slopes, and in moist tangles along drainage lines.</p><p>As with other cisticolas, the easiest and most reliable way of locating and correctly identifying this species is to listen for its diagnostic voice. During the breeding season (which varies regionally) males perch on tall weeds or tops of bushes and sing short, sweet, hurried medleys. Short display flights are occasionally performed low over the vegetation. Throughout the year both sexes also give piercing, ‘anxious’ alarm calls – it is almost impossible to disregard the continued protests if a pair’s territory is invaded or their nest inadvertently approached. Its confiding nature, loud vocalisations, insistent objections and habit of perching conspicuously make the Levaillant’s Cisticola one of the most characteristic and frequently encountered birds in wetland habitats. However, they are far less conspicuous when foraging in low vegetation or on the ground, where they hunt insects and other small invertebrates.</p><p>Like various other water-associated birds, Levaillant’s Cisticola has benefited from the construction of dams and canals and the establishment of irrigation schemes in agricultural zones. This has allowed it to populate new areas and to increase its density in arid regions such as the Karoo, Namaqualand and along the Orange River. However, dispersal is probably relatively slow as this species, like most of its relatives, is mostly resident. Nevertheless, some small-scale movements do occur, depending on rainfall and flood conditions, and recoveries of ringed birds have shown that a few individuals moved several hundred kilometres, a remarkable feat for a short-winged species like this.</p><p>The recent and continuing changes in the common names of birds have been met with some understandable grumbling from birders. However, the need for standardising bird names internationally is excellently exemplified by Levaillant’s Cisticola. Elsewhere in its fragmented African range, this species is often called Tinkling Cisticola, whereas the species known as Tinkling Cisticola by southern African birders is instead referred to as Grey Cisticola. This potentially confusing example is just one of the myriad cases that would benefit from allocating standard bird names across the globe.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Levaillant’s or Striped Cuckoo is a fairly large cuckoo with a black back and white underparts that are well streaked around the chin and throat, distinguishing it from the smaller, pale morph of Jaco&#173;bin Cuckoo. They also have a conspicuous crest which is often raised. In flight they show a white ‘window’ towards the end of the wing. The male has a favourite calling post from which he gives his loud, trilling ‘kreeu-kreeu’ call which is followed by a rapid chattering call.</p><p>The Levaillant’s Cuckoo breeds by laying its eggs in babblers’ nests, especially the Arrow-marked Babbler. The babblers live in small groups, and normally have one member of the group on duty near the nest. As a result, the flock’s attention needs to be diverted to allow the female to access the nest. To do so, a pair of Levaillant’s Cuckoos approaches the nest together, with the male displaying conspicuously. The babblers are aware of the danger and try to chase the displaying bird away. While they are thus engaged, the female slips into the nest and takes only a few seconds to lay an egg. This does not always work the first time, though, and repeated attempts are made. The cuckoo lays blue eggs which match the Arrow-marked Babbler’s eggs very well, but are slightly larger. She often dents the babblers’ eggs, and may return to the nest even after laying to dent other eggs, but this does not always stop them hatching.</p><p>The Levaillant’s Cuckoo breeds by laying its eggs in babblers’ nests, especially the Arrow-marked Babbler.

She often dents the babblers’ eggs, and may return to the nest even after laying to dent other eggs, but this does not always stop them hatching.</p><p>The cuckoo’s egg usually hatches first and the chick immediately starts demanding as much food as it can possibly eat. It is so demanding that it outgrows the babbler chicks, starving them to death. However, in exceptionally good years when food is abundant, the babblers may rear one or two of their own chicks, as well as the cuckoo. This is possible because the babblers are co-operative breeders and all of the birds in the group help to feed the chicks. Babbler groups can consist of up to eight birds, but three to five birds are more typical. The entire group runs a shuttle service of fast food to the chicks throughout the nestling period. On one occasion I even found two cuckoo chicks in the same nest, but at the time that I found the nest, one of the cuckoo chicks was about twice as big as the other one and the second one eventually starved to death along with the remaining babbler chick.</p><p>In the Marondera area of Zimbabwe, Arrow-marked Babblers start nesting as early as August if there is sufficient food. This is particularly common among flocks that inhabit farmhouse gardens. By laying early, they typically get a clutch of eggs laid and hatched before the Levaillant’s Cuckoos return from central Africa in October. Chicks from these early clutches are usually successfully reared, and some might join the flock but others would move away to join another group of babblers. The babblers then usually had a second brood and it was this brood which was parasitised by the cuckoos.</p><p>The fledged cuckoo chick has a begging call which sounds like part of the babbler’s call. It uses this call to solicit food for about four or five weeks after leaving the nest, and then suddenly one day it stops calling and heads off on its own. It is interesting that the babblers chase the young cuckoo when it flies but still feed it when it begs for food, making the right sort of call.&#9;</p>",

As a result, Light-mantled Albatrosses are rare vagrants to southern Africa, with almost all records of storm-driven birds that are found sick or dead ashore. Despite their very long wings, Light-mantled Albatrosses are surprisingly accomplished divers, reaching depths of up to 12 metres. Both species of sooty albatrosses feed mainly on squid, but small seabirds feature in their diets so regularly that they appear to target them as prey rather than simply scavenging dead or dying individuals. Although Light-mantled Albatrosses are occasionally caught on longlines, their populations are more stable than those of Sooty Albatrosses; probably because there is much less fishing effort in their preferred foraging areas. Numbers at South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands appear to have increased over the last few decades, and the species is currently listed as Near-threatened.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Lilac-breasted Rollers are a frequent and familiar sight in the savanna woodlands of southern Africa, usually seen conspicuously perched on a dead branch, telephone pole or wire, or on top of a tree, especially along roads with wide grassy verges. The colour combination in the plumage would be considered outrageous among designers for ladies’ clothing, mixing as it does glossy olive green, brown, rufous, dark blue, dusky blue and lilac.</p><p>The range of the Lilac-breasted Roller is from Eritrea south through East Africa, west to Angola and south to South Africa, mainly north of 28° South. It occurs in several dry woodland types: Acacia savanna, Miombo (Brachystegia) woodland, Lala Palm (Hyphaene) savanna and Mopane Colophospermum mopane woodland, provided there are some open areas that the birds can watch from a perch. They also occur in well-developed Miombo woodland where there are relatively few really open areas, but with ground cover thin enough for the birds to see potential prey. Lilac-breasted Rollers forage by using a sit-and-wait technique, perching high and watching for prey on the ground below. Prey items are pounced upon and are often taken back to the perch, where the prey may be beaten against the perch before being swallowed. Food includes a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates: locusts, crickets, beetles, butterflies, ants, termites, spiders, scorpions, caterpillars and snails, and lizards, small snakes, frogs, birds and rodents. The birds are attracted to fires where they may hawk insects in flight or pounce on roasted prey on the ground. In one observation, a Lilac-breasted Roller followed three Greater Kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros adults as they moved through the woodland, and hawked insects disturbed by the kudu.</p><p>The range of the Lilac-breasted Roller is from Eritrea south through East Africa, west to Angola and south to South Africa, mainly north of 28° South.

One nest at Nylsvley, Limpopo Province, was in an old woodpecker nest in a power line pole, and another was lower down from the broken-off top of a vertical rotten tree trunk. In one case a nest box used by Meyer’s Parrots in late winter was then used by Lilac-breasted Rollers in spring. One nest, in a major branch of an African Seringa Burkea africana, was in a partly broken open old Bennett’s Woodpecker nest. The nesting pair had been observed perched on the nest tree and on adjacent trees for more than a month before the nest was inspected when it contained three fresh eggs. This site was used again the following year, and again two years later.</p><p>Pre-nesting activity by the pair includes making themselves noticeable and being not particularly wary about revealing the nest. In one observation, a Lilac-breasted Roller arrived in a dead tree, called a scolding, low-pitched call for about a minute, and then went into a hole in the tree that it then proceeded to clean out by scratching out debris. The birds do not add any nest material, although a few pieces of plant matter and hairs have been recorded as nest lining. Incubation is by both sexes, disproportionately more by the female. The eggs hatch asynchronously, and the young leave the nest after about 30 days. The nest hole is heavily defended against most other species of birds, even after breeding is over.</p><p>Irregular movements in Lilac-breasted Rollers have been widely recorded. Such movements may have an element of nomadism and may be local, the birds moving to more open habitats after breeding, or they may be longer-distance seasonal movements from higher to lower altitudes. &#9;</p>",

The Little Bee-eater – the smallest member of the family at only 14 grams – is all of these. It is the most widespread of the resident African bee-eaters, occurring throughout the mesic areas of southern Africa.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Little Bee-eater does indeed eat bees which, together with wasps and other Hymenoptera, comprise the bulk of its diet. Due to the speed and manoeuvrability of these insects, Little Bee-eaters are correspondingly alert and quick – and prefer an open habitat where they can spot and hawk their prey. Little Bee-eaters are entertaining to watch, and one is immediately struck by their attentiveness; they continuously look for food, scanning the sky and turning their heads to track passing dragonflies or bees. Sometimes they will tip forward with half-opened wings as though to take off (an ‘intention movement’), before deciding better of it, but when they do sally forth on a short foray, they have a high success rate. It is noticeable that this species usually attacks its prey from below and behind so that it cannot be seen approaching.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Little Bee-eater does indeed eat bees which, together with wasps and other Hymenoptera, comprise the bulk of its diet.

It is noticeable that this species usually attacks its prey from below and behind so that it cannot be seen approaching.</p><p>A bee caught in the air needs to be ‘de-venomed’ before being swallowed. To do so, Little Bee-eaters invariably return to a branch where the sting is discharged by rubbing the bee’s abdomen against the perch. This behaviour is termed bee-rubbing, and only bees are treated in this way – other insects are either swallowed on the wing or, if they are large, are beaten against the perch to immobilise them. Young bee-eaters instinctively handle bees in this way, albeit rather clumsily, and are frequently stung while perfecting the technique. Although they have a high degree of immunity, they show some distress when stung, and learn quickly!</p><p>The Little Bee-eater is less social than many other bee-eaters, occurring in pairs and small family groups. It is monogamous, and helpers at the nest – which are a conspicuous feature of many other bee-eater species – have never been recorded. The pair nests alone, in an earth tunnel made in low banks. Nest excavation is apparently a powerful compulsion, and both sexes need to perform a certain amount of digging, with bills and feet, before they can successfully enter the next stage of reproduction. Incubation starts when the first egg is laid, so hatching is staggered, resulting in a strong size hierarchy among the brood. The young defecate in the nest chamber, and regurgitate ‘pellets’ comprising the indigestible chitinous exoskeletons of their insect food, but surprisingly when they fledge, they emerge from the dark, dank nest interior with immaculate plumage, every feather clean and preened into place. Equally miraculously, the chicks make their maiden flights without ever having had the opportunity to spread their wings in the confines of the nest chamber – let alone practise flying.</p><p>The Little Bee-eater is a suitable host species for brood parasites – it is widespread, insectivorous, nests are easy to find, and it is relatively easy to bypass the defences of a single pair compared to colonial nesters. It is not surprising then that the Greater Honeyguide parasitises this species, and this has probably been going on for aeons, since the bee-eater has developed its own particular defence strategy – the eggs are relatively thick-shelled. The female honeyguide punctures one or more of the host’s eggs when laying hers, and Little Bee-eater host-females laying thicker-shelled eggs have a selective advantage. What is interesting is how the larger honeyguide gets into the small bee-eater tunnel.</p><p>Hilary Fry ends his book, The Bee-eaters, by stating that the pleasure of watching these altogether delightful birds can be augmented with the rewards of discovery. This is certainly true of the ubiquitous Little Bee-eater.&#9;</p>",

The species has been recorded widely across southern Africa, even occurring in isolated wetlands in otherwise arid environments such as found in central Namibia and the Karoo. Southern Africa’s resident Little Bitterns belong to the subspecies payesii, which occurs right across sub-Saharan Africa. In summer, the resident population is augmented by seasonal visitors from the Palaearctic. The latter belong to the nominate race, minutus, and are distinguishable from local birds by being substantially larger and by having the face and neck pale buff rather than chestnut-coloured. Birds of the nominate race are here between October and April and occur, at times, side by side with the local birds. Little Bitterns also occur in Asia, Australia and Madagascar.</p><p>In flight, Little Bitterns have a diagnostic wing pattern. The wing is black, except for a large panel of white and pale buff on the upperwing coverts: this two-tone pattern is both striking and renders the flying bird conspicuous. Females differ from males by being browner above and by having broader and more extensive buff-and-white streaking extending from the throat to the belly. The streaked front provides very effective camouflage for the birds when they perceive a threat and adopt the ‘bittern posture’, facing the potential danger and pointing the bill upwards. In so doing, they blend effectively into the surrounding vegetation, myopic-looking eyes glaring at the intruder from each side of the upraised bill. Juvenile birds are even more cryptically marked, being heavily streaked both in front and on the back.</p><p>In flight, Little Bitterns have a diagnostic wing pattern.

The male’s territorial call, heard in summer, is a bark-like gogh, uttered repeatedly at 1-2 second intervals. Calling males can sometimes be seen perched high on a reed stem. More usually, though, the sound emanates from an invisible bird lurking in the depths of reeds or sedges. These birds also frequently give a second call – a rapid, staccato gak-ak-ak-akakak... The best chance of seeing Little Bitterns in the open is either in the very early morning or late in the evening.</p><p>The breeding cycle has been studied in detail in the Western Cape and the behaviour recorded much resembles that of other heron species. The male selects the nest site, usually placing the scant, saucer-shaped nest less than a metre above the water in reeds, dense grass or sedges. It is completed in 4-5 days and the clutch of 2-5 eggs is then laid at a rate of one per day. Incubation begins before clutch completion and is shared by the sexes, with changeovers occurring at about two-hour intervals. During this time the sitting bird sometimes does running repairs on the nest and may leave briefly to collect additional nest material. Changeovers occur surreptitiously, with the relieving bird creeping in through the undergrowth and the departing bird leaving the same way. The eggs hatch asynchronously and, as they hatch, the shells are carried off by the bird in attendance and dropped some distance away so as not to draw the attention of potential predators to the nest. Nestlings, fed and brooded by both parents, develop rapidly, feathering and reaching adult size by the age of 15 days at which time they leave the nest permanently. By 27 days they can fly strongly. If conditions are suitable, pairs that nest early may breed a second time after successfully raising a brood.</p>",

At least two more individuals have turned up on the west coast since, one adult remaining in the vicinity of the Olifants River mouth for more than 5 years (2001-2006) before disappearing, and the other, first sighted in 2000, being seen at various localities over the ensuing 18 months.</p><p>How such birds come to make this 5 000 to 6 000 km Atlantic Ocean crossing is uncertain but it is not unprecedented: numerous American Purple Gallinules have done the same thing over the years. Both species are migrants that commute twice a year between North and South America, and perhaps during migration occasional birds get blown off-course in storms and end up at sea. Both species turn up on Tristan da Cunha from time to time. The Western Cattle Egret has done the same thing in reverse but with greater success. First recorded in South America in the late 1800s, this African species gained a permanent foothold in the early 1900s, and has now spread widely across North and South America.</p><p>How such birds come to make this 5 000 to 6 000 km Atlantic Ocean crossing is uncertain but it is not unprecedented: numerous American Purple Gallinules have done the same thing over the years.

It stayed until 3 April 2012 and allowed many birders to get their first view and photographs of this species. The timing of its arrival suggests that it migrated the wrong way – so-called ‘reverse migration’ – heading south instead of north when leaving its wintering grounds.</p><p>Little Crakes breed in central Europe and the steppes of Russia and surrounding countries.

It has an extensive range, occurring right across sub-Saharan Africa, through southern and eastern Europe, the Middle East and eastwards to southern Asia, Japan and Australia. Birds across this range often look different to the bird we know well in our region; in Australia, for example, Little Egrets have black (not yellow) toes, and in parts of Africa a rare, dark morph also occurs.</p><p>A number of other Little Egret look-alikes have appeared on our shores in recent years, which muddy the identification waters, though. The recently-recorded Snowy Egret, for example,  found widely in North and South America, looks very similar, as does the Western Reef Heron, a coastal bird from West Africa that has also appeared here recently. And it is probably only a matter of time before a third look-alike, the Dimorphic Egret Egretta dimorpha from coastal Madagascar and East Africa, also joins the list. So one should never take our common, familiar Little Egret, found on virtually every lagoon, estuary, lake or pan in the region, too much for granted – if its lores are yellow, rather than greyish, if the bill seems a little more robust than usual, or if the nape feathers look bushy, the bird needs a closer look.</p><p>A number of other Little Egret look-alikes have appeared on our shores in recent years, which muddy the identification waters, though.

Or, as they wade, they shuffle one foot in the water ahead of them. They do employ the stand-and-wait hunting technique too, but it doesn’t characterise them so much as the foot-stirring and high-gait stride does. Fish are their primary food source, but amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic insects are taken opportunistically. At times they may fish alongside a cormorant or grebe, using them to flush potential prey. Once the appetite has been satisfied, a Little Egret will leave the water and find an undisturbed branch or rock on which to perch, where it will spend the next hour or so grooming, scratching, wing-stretching and engaging in other comfort behaviours.</p><p>Lagoon-living Little Egrets mostly fish solitarily, and they are often highly territorial when doing so, sometimes flying a hundred metres to displace another fishing Little Egret perceived to be in their territory. There are circumstances, though, when dozens, or even hundreds, gather to exploit particularly rich food sources. To see the birds in such a group darting between each other after a fish shoal, is in stark contrast to the usual behaviour observed along lagoon edges. At dusk, territoriality ceases and Little Egrets join forces as they fly off to night-time roost sites.</p><p>Roosting and breeding are communal activities and Little Egrets usually, but not invariably, join other egrets and herons to breed in mixed-species heronries. It is then that they grow the distinctive nape plumes which usually stay intact until the next moult. Other ornate white plumes develop on the mantle and chest, and there are temporary colour changes to the toes, which become reddish, and the lores, which become violet: these colours revert once nesting gets under way. Little Egret nesting behaviour is in line with that of other herons and egrets – both sexes share nest-building, incubation and nestling care. When breeding is completed young birds disperse widely. A nestling ringed in the Western Cape was subsequently recovered as far afield as Mozambique.</p>",

This species is very widespread in southern Africa, absent only from the arid central Kalahari and Namib deserts. Elsewhere they occur over most of Eurasia east to the western Pacific Ocean and the south-eastern Asian islands. The birds have a remarkable ability to locate isolated new habitats, even in very dry areas. New dams are colonised by a single bird or a pair, sometimes within a year of construction. Sewage disposal ponds, although generally lacking in emergent vegetation, are also used, but seldom for breeding.</p><p>Little Grebes are usually seen in pairs, sometimes in groups of 5-6 birds, sometimes in flocks of several hundred, often with some interactions between individuals chasing each other, pattering across the water with wings flapping. Such chases may end in calling between two or more birds. Little Grebes roost in communal rafts, sometimes large, with many individual birds, the groups joining up at sunset and dispersing in pairs or small groups at sunrise.</p><p>Little Grebes are usually seen in pairs, sometimes in groups of 5-6 birds, sometimes in flocks of several hundred, often with some interactions between individuals chasing each other, pattering across the water with wings flapping.

Little Grebes roost in communal rafts, sometimes large, with many individual birds, the groups joining up at sunset and dispersing in pairs or small groups at sunrise.</p><p>Little Grebes mainly dive when foraging. Food includes small fish, frogs, tadpoles, aquatic insects and larvae, small crustaceans and molluscs. They dive silently, or with a splash of their feet, and remain submerged for about 15 seconds and travel 5-30 metres while underwater. Associations between Little Grebes and diving or dabbling ducks, probably for food benefits, have been noted. However, Little Grebes are apparently impacted by high densities of Egyptian Geese, and numbers of Little Grebes decrease with an increase in goose numbers. The grebes have also been recorded following Hippopotamuses Hippopotamus amphibius to feed on aquatic animals that have been disturbed. A habit in all the grebes, including Little Grebe, is to eat their own feathers, thought to be to wrap fish bones so that the bones can be regurgitated comfortably in pellets.</p><p>This species lacks the elaborate, ritualised courtship displays performed by many other species of grebe (including Black-necked and Great Crested Grebe). The displays are fairly simple, involving wing-waving followed by pattering over the water and other rituals, including mutually presenting water weed and presentation of food, and building of rudimentary nest platforms. Little Grebes are monogamous and territorial, but nest spacing decreases with increasing emergent vegetation. Nests are floating heaps of water plants, concealed in vegetation or out on open water, and usually anchored in some way to a submerged branch or sedges. During incubation the birds continually add material to the nest. When one bird is sitting the other brings nest material which the sitting bird arranges around or under the eggs. Sometimes the incubating bird slips off the nest and helps in collecting nest material. This continual building up of the nest is absolutely essential because the nest material is often waterlogged. Thus the nest gradually sinks, and unless the birds continually build it up, the eggs eventually become submerged. The nest ‘cup’ is just above water level. The eggs are always covered by the incubating bird when he or she leaves the nest, and the eggs become stained by the wet feet of the birds and the wet nest material. The chicks start moving about on the nest soon after hatching, then they leave the nest and make short swims, or they float on the water with their feet and toes spread out behind them. Chicks may be with either parent, swimming nearby, and climbing on to the parent’s back at intervals.&#9;</p>",

Likewise, its previously used name of African Sedge Warbler also hints at its favourite home – wetlands with beds of sedges, rushes or papyrus, and flooded grasslands. It is decidedly less common in pure reed beds, a useful distinction in the identification of superficially characterless brown, wetland warblers. Suitable habitat for the Little Rush Warbler may be found along the verges of pans, marshes, rivers, lakes, dams, canals, lagoons, estuaries and even sewage ponds.</p><p>The Little Rush Warbler is widespread across sub-Saharan Africa, where ten subspecies are currently recognised, four of which occur in southern Africa.

Recent research shows that some populations in East Africa differ significantly in their voices and genetic signatures, and may be assigned to a new species in the near future.</p><p>In southern Africa, Little Rush Warblers are mainly year-round residents, although some small-scale movements may occur during the winter non-breeding season. The male’s distinctive, accelerating song may be heard throughout the year, and is a characteristic sound of wetland habitats. Although this species is monogamous and strongly territorial, several males may sing and display in a small area, and pairs often breed in loose colonies with as many as 10 pairs/ha in optimal habitat. At the height of the breeding season (early to midsummer), males may sing at night too.</p><p>The song is simple but utterly unmistakable – a repetition of 8-18 ‘kirp’ notes, all at the same pitch, that starts hesitantly but soon accelerates into a short trill, only to stop rather suddenly – ‘kirp, kirp, kirp, kirp-kirp-kirp, kirpkirpkirpkirpkirp’. The sound reminds one of a dropped table-tennis ball bouncing faster and faster until it stops. Song phrases are often synchronised with short display flights, during which the singer flutters just above the vegetation, or in a path between the stems. During such flights its short, rounded wings produce volleys of audible wingbeats, and the tail may be flicked up and down. They also have a soft nasal bleat.</p><p>Like its other Bradypterus relatives, the Little Rush Warbler is rather secretive and can be difficult to see well, typically providing only brief, partly obscured glimpses as it climbs about just above the water or runs on the ground. When nervous or excited, however, a bird may sidle up a stem and momentarily perch in the open. Early risers may also enjoy better views, as the birds are more demonstrative at that time. Just after sunrise they may perch openly, forage on lily pads or walk over open ground. Little Rush Warblers are generally reluctant to take flight and prefer to slink away through the vegetation; if flushed they usually flutter weakly for only a few metres before dropping back into cover. As a result of their creeping, partly terrestrial lifestyles, their graduated, rounded tails quickly become frayed and tattered.</p><p>The nest is well concealed and difficult to find. It is placed less than a metre above the ground or water, amongst fallen vegetation or in the base of a sedge or rush tussock. The outer rim is untidily constructed with coarse, dry material, but the inner nest cup is lined with shreds of finer vegetation. Two or three chicks hatch after approximately two weeks and are fed by both parents; they leave the nest after another two weeks. Young birds closely resemble the adults, but are more richly coloured above and washed yellowish below. &#9;</p>",

P. a. tunneyi occurs mainly off the south and east coasts, where it may occur in small numbers year-round. One came ashore at night on Bird Island, Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape in two successive years, and others have been found ashore on Robben Island in the Western Cape.

But this is not really the case as, in favoured habitats, nesting pairs can be spaced at intervals of 3-4 kilometres, each hunting an area of, say, 1 000 hectares. Yet one encounters the birds very infrequently – at least away from an active nest – and such encounters are typically fleeting views of a bird in flight or swooping up into the concealment of the leafy foliage of a large tree.</p><p>The breeding season is when one’s chance of seeing and getting to know the bird is much greater as the pair is closely tied to a nest site then, and once the nest has been located the birds can be seen nearby at will. The male and female are especially vocal in the early stages of nesting, in August and September, with both sexes uttering a rapid series of piping whistled ‘tu-tu-tu-tu’… or ‘ki-ki-ki-ki-ki’... notes, the male’s call distinctly lower pitched than the female’s. They are calls that are often imitated to perfection by Fork-tailed Drongos that reside within earshot of the sparrowhawks, and the drongos often utter these calls when they spot one of these little raptors nearby. The sparrowhawks call while soaring over their nesting area early in the nesting cycle, and they call when interacting near the nest. Nests are placed in a fork high up in a large tree, and mature eucalypts, wherever they occur, are much favoured for this. If one detects the birds calling in the vicinity of a copse of eucalypts one needs only to search through the upper branches of all the largest trees for a small stick platform to locate the nest. A literal telltale of the nest being occupied will be an incubating bird’s tail protruding visibly beyond the edge of the nest.</p><p>The breeding season is when one’s chance of seeing and getting to know the bird is much greater as the pair is closely tied to a nest site then, and once the nest has been located the birds can be seen nearby at will.

The female does most or all of the nest construction and she lays a clutch of two plain white eggs, most laying occurring in October. In common with many other raptors, the female does not hunt during the incubation period but is fed then by the male which, at intervals during the day, flies in carrying prey, calling as he approaches. She responds in kind as she slips off the nest, takes the food from him, then retreats to a perch to feed. Males usually take over the incubation while she feeds and grooms, and if there is no pressure to continue hunting, he’ll perch quietly nearby when she resumes incubating.</p><p>Little Sparrowhawks prey mainly on birds between 15–60 g in size – waxbills, mannikins, weavers, sunbirds, prinias, bulbuls and the like. Some of the prey is caught by still-hunting at drinking or feeding sites, and the sparrowhawk ambushes these by perching concealed in a nearby tree close to the site, then swooping in and snatching up the victim before it has a chance to flee. Another method is to fly low and fast through woodland, hoping to surprise small birds and catch them as they panic. Their toll on small passerines is likely to be considerable, perhaps in the region of 1 000 birds per pair per annum.</p><p>Little Sparrowhawks are often confused with Shikras, Ovambo Sparrowhawks, Gabar Goshawks and even the smaller males of African Goshawks, and one needs to have a good view of a bird’s markings on the upper tail, and/or to ascertain the bird’s eye and eye-ring colour to be certain of its identity.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a common, Palaearctic-breeding visitor to Africa, avoiding only deserts, mountainous regions and forested areas without exposed water bodies. It breeds in a fairly narrow band in the Arctic tundra from northern Scandinavia across Siberia to about 145°E on the Yana River, with occasional stragglers east to the Chukotka Peninsula. Most of the population spends the non-breeding season in Africa, with the more easterly breeding birds migrating to the Indian subcontinent. In our area it is found equally commonly on freshwater and saltwater habitats, but it is only in large, sheltered, tidal embayments such as Walvis Bay that numbers may run into their thousands. At freshwater sites in our region they normally occur in small parties that come together at night to form communal roosts that may number a few hundred birds. Because they occur in small numbers scattered over the vast area of interior southern Africa it is very difficult to estimate the size of our visiting population, which is thought to lie anywhere between 60&#160;000 and 200&#160;000 birds.</p><p>There are estimated to be about 1.3 million Little Stints visiting southern Europe, Arabia and Africa each year, this number varying, dependent on the breeding success in the previous summer. Year-to-year chick production is closely tied to lemming cycles in the Arctic. This cycle runs on a three- to five-year basis during which lemmings – small, hamster-like rodents – fluctuate in numbers from abundant to almost non-existent. When abundant, the Arctic predators, including raptors, jaegers and foxes, live off this bonanza, but when lemming numbers are low the predators turn to the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds, including waders. Thus, in a ‘lemming year’, birds have very successful breeding seasons while in non-lemming years the breeding failure rate can approach 100%. Breeding success is also affected by weather. Cold, wet summers can have as devastating an effect on breeding success.</p><p>There are estimated to be about 1.3 million Little Stints visiting southern Europe, Arabia and Africa each year, this number varying, dependent on the breeding success in the previous summer.

Departure begins as early as February in the south, but mostly takes place during March and April, with some young birds remaining until May. Few birds spend the winter here, although occasionally mass overwintering does occur as has been recorded at Lake Ngami, Botswana, where some 600 birds were present in the winter of 1970. Among those birds that do remain in winter, there are considerable movements, for example, a bird ringed on 23 June outside Harare, Zimbabwe, and recaptured 28 days later at Barberspan in the North West Province. Being such a small wader, recoveries of dead birds are few, and following the movements of ringed birds is dependent largely on the efforts of bird ringers elsewhere. This explains the documented movements between northern Zimbabwe and Barberspan, between South Africa and Namibia, and between southern Africa and Kenya and the DRC. The few recoveries in Eurasia indicate a migration route that passes through the Black and Caspian Seas en route to more easterly breeding grounds.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Writing at the beginning of the 1900s for the third volume of The Fauna of South Africa: Birds, Stark and Sclater knew of only one record of this small swift, a colony on a cliff near Beaufort West, in the Western Cape; this was in contrast to the several records they had for the White-rumped Swift over much of South Africa. A population explosion appears to have begun soon after this and by 1936 Gill, in his guide to South African birds, could describe it as common in many parts of the country, especially in the Karoo and on the Highveld; its range and numbers have continued to increase and flocks of ‘circussing’ Little Swifts are now a familiar feature over most settlements in southern Africa. This is certainly the result of their adapting to nesting on buildings, bridges and other constructions, with those higher than a single storey preferred.</p><p>They usually nest in colonies (often many years old) which can unfortunately be messy and which frequently make the birds unpopular, especially when the droppings accumulate on windowsills or in doorways, or streak down walls. I have also heard of them being accused of bringing ‘lice’ into habitations, with these spreading from their rather untidy closed nests (made mostly of feathers and wind-blown plant debris, collected aerially) under the eaves of flats, but I have not been able to verify this. Nesting among the dead fronds of an exotic Washingtonia palm has been reported, and Little Swifts sometimes usurp swallows’ nests, occupying them until their owners are forced to abandon them.</p><p>They usually nest in colonies (often many years old) which can unfortunately be messy and which frequently make the birds unpopular, especially when the droppings accumulate on windowsills or in doorways, or streak down walls.

Nesting among the dead fronds of an exotic Washingtonia palm has been reported, and Little Swifts sometimes usurp swallows’ nests, occupying them until their owners are forced to abandon them.</p><p>It has been suggested that this bird favours buildings with corrugated iron roofs and site their nests directly under these for the warmth they will afford their young, but such planning seems unlikely; in fact, such nests have been reported to become unbearably hot and nestlings are forced to fledge prematurely. These chicks are often rescued by well-wishers and are quite readily reared to flying, but the benefit of this is questionable. I once fostered a chick picked up on the edge of the Bloemfontein city centre; when I released it at a colony from which I thought it might have originated it flew off strongly towards the birds which were flying around the colony, but which then turned on it, pursued it and seemed to force it to the ground some distance away. Presumably its calls were immediately recognised as coming from a bird foreign to the colony. (The chick, reared in a very large room, seemed healthy, but was fed mainly mealworms, a substitute diet subsequently not recommended, according to a European website devoted to the Common Swift.) A bird (of unknown age) which ended up in the water below a large colony on a concrete bridge over a dam, was able to swim to a nearby support and crawl up this; others were not so fortunate and fell prey to Grey Herons.</p><p>From April most of the birds leave their colonies and move northwards, with at least some of these birds overwintering in parts of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe; however, the authority on African swifts, the late Richard Brooke, suggested it is possible that more birds remain at their colonies than is apparent, because these stay-behind birds disappear for the day to forage high in the winter skies. All of the insects and other arthropods in its diet are captured aerially, but a claim that it (and three other swift species) also take termite alates on the ground, is certainly a misinterpretation of a description of at least 30 species of birds feeding at a large nuptial flight of termites.&#9;</p>",

This tern looks tiny, even when seen alongside other smallish terns, such as Common Tern. Both during the day and at night-time roosts they maintain a close association with larger terns, no doubt benefiting from their presence because aerial predators such as Peregrine Falcons would be more likely to pursue the larger prey. When sitting in communal roosts, they tend to gather along the fringe where they are less likely to be pushed out by larger, arriving birds.</p><p>When migrating along the coast, they sometimes stop off to join parties or pairs of the closely related and similarly sized Damara Tern. However, the Little Tern is an east coast migrant arriving from September in the north, reaching the south coast by mid-October, and with a few penetrating north along the west coast to about the Olifants River estuary. The Damara Tern is a west coast migrant also arriving from September, but it occurs only as far east as Nelson Mandela Bay and, although found in some estuaries, is mainly a bird of the open beach.</p><p>When migrating along the coast, they sometimes stop off to join parties or pairs of the closely related and similarly sized Damara Tern.

The Damara Tern is a west coast migrant also arriving from September, but it occurs only as far east as Nelson Mandela Bay and, although found in some estuaries, is mainly a bird of the open beach.</p><p>Further, Damara Terns arrive in clean-looking breeding dress with a complete black cap while Little Terns arrive in non-breeding dress, looking distinctly scruffy and with noticeably contrasting, dark outer primaries in flight. Adult Little Terns mostly depart in February and March, by which time some have attained their breeding plumage. Some remain in the Eastern Cape until mid-April, with occasional birds into early May. Overwintering is rare in the south of the subregion, but further north final departure is progressively later and overwintering more frequent.</p><p>This tern is extremely mobile and moves between estuaries very quickly, often giving an enhanced impression of overall numbers. The only way to obtain accurate counts is to find the night-time roosts and count the birds in the evening. In both Algoa and St Francis Bays, the local birds all congregate at one estuary for the night.</p><p>The origins of our visitors are not known exactly, and there are no ring recoveries to narrow down the possibilities. Eastern Europe is the accepted provenance, with the majority thought to come from large river systems in Russia and surrounding countries as well as from the Black Sea. It is likely that birds from the Caspian Sea and eastwards to 80°E, winter further north in the Indian Ocean. In southern Africa they are common only in Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal, becoming much sparser southwards to St&#160;Francis Bay. Further west they are scarce, with the only notable concentrations found at Langebaan Lagoon and the Berg River estuary. In Namibia they are vagrants, and it is possible that these occasional visitors are of Western European origin, having overshot their West African winter quarters.</p><p>Along the east coast of southern Africa an identification problem arises because of the possible presence of Saunders’s Tern Sternula saundersi in northern Mozambique. Once considered a race of Little Tern, the actual non-breeding ranges of the two species have never been satisfactorily delimited. Saunders’s Tern is considered the common bird in East Africa and the non-breeding ranges probably overlap in Mozambique. Indeed, photographs have been taken on the Mozambique coast, south of the Zambezi, of groups of ‘little’ terns that almost certainly contain Saunders’s Terns. This is a classic example of leapfrog migration, with the more northerly bird overflying the off-season range of the more southerly breeding bird.</p>",

The endemic Knysna Turaco that occurs in the south and south-east has a complete crescent-shaped crest with a white edging to the feathers. From Zululand northwards along the coastal plain it is replaced by Livingstone’s Turaco, which has a thinner and more pointed crest. The third species, Schalow’s Turaco, only occurs within southern Africa from the Victoria Falls to the eastern Caprivi, and has much longer pointed feathers on the head, creating a distinctive headdress.</p><p>Livingstone’s Turaco is a green-coloured bird which has conspicuous white lines in front of and below the bright red eye. In flight it shows the red wings typical of the three forest turacos. However, when at rest they blend in well with the indigenous forests in which they make their home. They are very common in the forests of eastern Zimbabwe where I have watched and photographed them at the nest. They are conspicuous and noisy birds much of the time, but are much quieter when nesting, and approach the nest slowly and stealthily.</p><p>Livingstone’s Turaco is a green-coloured bird which has conspicuous white lines in front of and below the bright red eye.

The call is a series of harsh ‘crowing’ notes which are often taken up by other individuals and groups, until the whole forest rings with the turacos’ calls.</p><p>Like all turacos, this species is extremely agile, often running rapidly along branches and up sloping branches, before launching themselves out to glide or flap to the next tree. The birds in a flock often follow one another along the same branch and into the next tree where they may then move up into the canopy to feed on fruit. They feed almost exclusively on fruit, buds and insects in the trees in the forest. However, they go out of the forest into orchards to feed on fruiting trees and bushes planted by man, and can be quite a nuisance to fruit growers in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe.</p><p>The birds breed in late spring to early summer in Zimbabwe and may do so later in Mozambique. The nest is a simple platform of sticks that looks rather like a large dove’s nest. The nest is always well concealed in a thick bush or creeper within the forest, and is often near a clearing because the forest tends to be thicker where it is lighter. As a result they are well known for nesting along farm tracks and roads where thickets occur in association with the forest. Like many forest birds, they seem to prefer to nest fairly low down, often below five metres, probably because this helps to avoid predation by the Samango Monkeys, which are so common in the eastern Highland forests. The birds usually lay two white eggs which are more oval&#173;-shaped than many birds’ eggs.&#9;</p>",

However, they also make quite extensive use of small rodents when these are common. During an outbreak of Multimammate Mice in the Save Conservancy in Zimbabwe, Lizard Buzzards were seen to catch mice almost exclusively because there were so many of them available.</p><p>It is interesting that while the Lizard Buzzard is a bird of the woodlands, especially the miombo woodlands of Zimbabwe, it does also make quite extensive use of more open areas such as agricultural lands and short grassland. However, the birds retreat to the nearest woodland at the first sign of danger. When flying from one perch to the next, the Lizard Buzzard drops off the first perch and flies quite fast with alternating flapping and gliding, very close to the ground, then swoops up to the next perch from which it will hunt for some time before moving on.</p><p>Lizard Buzzards build a comparatively large, bulky nest for their size, in the fork of a large tree. Both indigenous and exotic trees are used, but unlike many other birds of prey, eucalypts are less favoured. The large, basin-shaped nest is built into the fork in such a way that the birds may approach the nest easily from at least one, if not two directions, depending on the angle of the branches forming the fork. Although they often lay three eggs, they seldom rear more than two chicks, and in many nests only rear one chick. It is remarkable how quickly the white, downy chicks’ feathers start to grow out. The older chicks often make a loud begging call as an adult approaches the nest. The chicks leave the nest after approximately forty days but continue to beg for food from the adults for some time thereafter. Their calls show that they move extensively through the woodland around the nest at this stage.</p>",

This is particularly true when it comes to the Long-billed Pipit – even the scientific name of this species warns birders about its similarity to other pipits.</p><p>Five subspecies of the Long-billed Pipits are recognised in southern Africa: anti-clockwise from southern Angola and north-western Namibia (palliditinctus) it extends southwards along the rugged central escarpment of Namibia (leucocraspedon) into the boulder-strewn landscapes of Namaqualand (nicholsoni); further south it occurs on the fold mountains of the Western Cape and eastwards onto the shales, sandstones and dolerite intrusions of the Karoo (primarius); populations in the rocky grasslands of the Drakensberg and alpine scrub of Lesotho (petricolus) also occur in rocky habitats in Swaziland and northern South Africa, but are replaced by the Wood Pipit north of the Limpopo.</p><p>Five subspecies of the Long-billed Pipits are recognised in southern Africa: anti-clockwise from southern Angola and north-western Namibia (palliditinctus) it extends southwards along the rugged central escarpment of Namibia (leucocraspedon) into the boulder-strewn landscapes of Namaqualand (nicholsoni); further south it occurs on the fold mountains of the Western Cape and eastwards onto the shales, sandstones and dolerite intrusions of the Karoo (primarius); populations in the rocky grasslands of the Drakensberg and alpine scrub of Lesotho (petricolus) also occur in rocky habitats in Swaziland and northern South Africa, but are replaced by the Wood Pipit north of the Limpopo.</p><p>The Long-billed Pipit’s extensive distribution extends in a highly fragmented fashion across the African continent, with multiple isolated populations attributable to seven subspecies, in addition to the five occurring in southern Africa. Some authorities maintain that certain of these populations should be treated as distinct species, such as the Bannerman’s Pipit of Cameroon, Nigeria and Liberia. Intriguing observations from East Africa may lead to the description of a new species, provisionally dubbed Nairobi Pipit, in the future; this form may also be related to the Wood Pipit, a species only recently split from the Long-billed Pipit. On a global stage, six more subspecies range from Israel through Yemen to the Himalayas and east to Myanmar. In fact, the species was first described from Jalna, in India’s Maharashtra state, by Thomas Caverhill Jerdon (1811-1872).</p><p>The name Long-billed Pipit is not infallibly accurate as this species’ bill is not always longer than some of its counterparts, particularly in the shorter-billed females. It is best identified by its shape, behaviour, voice and habitat, in combination with plumage features. In terms of habitat, it prefers fairly steep, grass-cloaked and rock-strewn slopes, from sea level but typically at 500-2&#160;500 m in altitude. Climatic considerations seem of less importance as it breeds on both inhospitable desert mountains in Namibia and in lush grassy hills in the high rainfall parts of KwaZulu-Natal. It also occurs in broken woodland on rocky ridges, where it frequently perches in trees. Although considered resident, it may descend to lower altitudes in winter to forage on burnt plains or other insect-rich habitats; for example, golfers at Sun City will find small groups of this species on the irrigated fairways in winter, but still in view of the surrounding rocky ridges of the Pilanesberg where the birds breed.</p><p>During the summer breeding season, male Long-billed Pipits utter their monotonous, simple-structured songs, composed of two to four sparrow-like notes repeated at intervals. The singer can often be located by scanning prominent boulders, small trees, fence posts or other exposed perches. The song is sometimes also given during a fluttering or circling display flight. On the ground, singletons or pairs search for prey by walking unhurriedly, sometimes while wagging their tails in a shallow manner. Their diet consists of insects, especially beetles and ants, as well as millipedes, centipedes and a small seed component. This species is often approachable and rather confiding, but when flushed tends to fly fast and far in a dipping manner, often while giving a sharp, metallic call.</p>",

This may create the impression that they are seasonal visitors, rather than residents. Like other viduines, Long-tailed Paradise-Whydahs feed largely on the ground, often in open areas bare of vegetation, where they scratch in the soil in a characteristic way for buried seeds. They roost communally in large leafy trees year-round, and can form large flocks in the non-breeding season. These may be nomadic, depending on food supplies in the area, and may include other small seed-eating birds, particularly other viduines.</p><p>Male Long-tailed Paradise-Whydahs first come into full breeding plumage in their second year, and then establish territories with trees and bushes at least four metres tall, where they sing and make short flights from conspicuous perches. They often use the same call sites in successive years. The display song includes both chattering whydah elements and mimicry of the song and calls of their brood host, the Green-winged Pytilia. Young males learn these vocalisations of their foster parent in the nest, and consequently they mimic the regional variations (dialects) found in pytilia song.</p><p>Male Long-tailed Paradise-Whydahs first come into full breeding plumage in their second year, and then establish territories with trees and bushes at least four metres tall, where they sing and make short flights from conspicuous perches.

Young males learn these vocalisations of their foster parent in the nest, and consequently they mimic the regional variations (dialects) found in pytilia song.</p><p>Several times each day, advertising males perform extended aerial displays which last up to 20&#160;minutes, covering a circuit of several hundred metres. They initially fly up to at least 30 metres above the ground, then circle in horizontal flight before descending to their perches in a series of jerky steps. Their tail feathers make a distinctive rustling sound during the descent. If a female perches in a male’s territory, he approaches her in an elaborate perched display, bowing and tossing his head, and presenting his tail in side-on view. Finally he hovers above her prior to copulation. Males are polygynous, mating with several females if they can, but it is not certain whether females also mate with several partners during one breeding season. Tail length could be important both in male-male interactions and in female mate selection.</p><p>After mating, females must find a host nest in which to lay their eggs. The Green-winged Pytilia is the only confirmed host species in southern Africa, but female Long-tailed Paradise-Whydahs have also been seen investigating the nests of Violet-eared Waxbills. When laying, the female usually removes and eats one of the host eggs. Up to five whydah eggs have been found in the same host nest, and where several additional eggs have appeared on the same day, it is clear that more than one brood parasite is responsible. It would seem that synchronising hatching with the host young is crucial to the survival of the whydah chicks, since chicks that hatched more than two days after their nest mates died. The mouth markings of the nestling Long-tailed Paradise-Whydah closely resemble those of the Green-winged Pytilia, and they seem to receive food from the host parents at the same rate as their nest mates.</p>",

Subadult males have brown bills and wings, whereas adult males in breeding plumage have bluish bills and wholly black plumage except for the red epaulets bordered with white at the back.</p><p>The ‘laboured’ display flight of males in breeding plumage, apparently weighed down by their huge tails (typically &gt; 0.5 m in length), was probably the source of early travellers’ tales that after heavy rain the birds were unable to fly and could be caught by hand.

We still lack information on the age at which wild birds first achieve full plumage; a captive male took three years. Comparative measurements of museum specimens suggest that both wing and tail length may continue to increase for at least one year after the birds first moult into nuptial plumage. Once males have acquired the black wing feathers, these are retained in non-breeding plumage, and the birds are easily recognised by their slow flight showing the black remiges behind the red and white epaulets.

The tail feathers in eclipse plumage are brown.</p><p>Males occupy a territory typically covering 0.5 ha of open grassland, with some shrubs or higher points for perching; fence posts will do. When pursuing intruding males, they fly fast and straight, with the tail streaming out behind. Females are approached in a slow flight, with the tail curved below the body like a keel, and the coloured epaulets very conspicuous. If the female lands in the territory, perched courtship then follows, with a hissing song and pumping movements of the body.</p><p>The Long-tailed Widow is polygynous, with some males markedly more successful than others. An experimental study in Kenya found that males with artificially elongated tails were more successful in attracting females than ‘normal’ males, while birds with shortened tails were significantly less successful. So this might suggest female preference for the oldest birds in the population.  Here the nest itself clearly plays no role in female mate choice. Although males will knot some grass strips together, they do not produce a complete nest frame, and the nest used for breeding is constructed entirely by the female, within the territory of the male with whom she has mated. It is a domed structure close to the ground with a side entrance, often with living grass woven into the outside, and lined with fine grass and seedheads. The female is also responsible for both incubation and feeding of the young. Surprisingly, there are some records of parasitism by the Dideric Cuckoo in South Africa.</p><p>Food is primarily grass seeds, with insects taken as well, especially while feeding the young; birds will even hawk insects in flight. A captive male survived for 17 years, although he was apparently unable to fly during the last two years of life.  During the non-breeding season the birds join communal roosts with other bishops and weavers, and may move locally in search of food; however, we know very little about their activities during this phase of the year.</p>",

Its long toes enable it to walk on floating vegetation in the manner of a jacana. Throughout its range it has a very patchy distribution, with the bulk of the southern race, leucopterus, occurring in Zambia and Botswana’s Okavango Swamps. However, with man-made changes to waterways it has been able to expand its range into areas such as northern Zimbabwe where it has colonised the mats of Kariba Weed on Lake Kariba as well as spreading downstream where large areas of the alien Water Hyacinth have taken hold as far east as Cahora Bassa dam. The world population is estimated at not more than 50&#160;000 birds.</p><p>Its main competitor for habitat space appears to be the African Jacana: these two species show considerable aggression towards each other when either one is breeding. The adults are also highly territorial towards conspecifics as well as towards close congeners such as the Blacksmith Lapwing that feed on the adjacent shoreline. The nest is normally a floating platform of vegetation, although the birds sometimes make a scrape in damp mud close to water. The three or four eggs are blotched blackish on an olive-khaki background. The young take up to eight weeks to fledge. Something to watch out for, but which I have never witnessed, is whether the young dive under water to evade capture as do jacana and stilt chicks.</p><p>Its main competitor for habitat space appears to be the African Jacana: these two species show considerable aggression towards each other when either one is breeding.

During the continuing drought years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, water levels at Lake Kariba dropped to record low levels, leaving no suitable floating vegetation. Although it might have been expected that the affected birds would have ventured upstream to more permanent waters to the west of the Victoria Falls, or even crossed the escarpment to reach the Kafue Flats, quite a few ventured south to end up on the Manyame Lakes near Harare. Here the water levels were also low, and the lapwings were forced to feed along the open shoreline with other waders. The species was once considered a vagrant to Lake Ngami in Botswana, but the strong annual floods of the 2000s have raised water levels there to hitherto unrecorded levels. This in turn has led to the establishment of huge patches of floating vegetation, and Long-toed Lapwings have established themselves quite commonly on areas of such vegetation where these have been flattened by larger birds such as pelicans.</p>",

Like other small insectivores it seldom needs to drink, so it is not a regular visitor to the garden birdbath, and it rarely uses such a facility for a quick dip. Surface water is scarce in the dry woodland and scrub that these birds normally inhabit, so they ‘bathe’ in wet foliage on dewy mornings. In the Little Karoo, Long-billed Crombecs often get their plumage well wetted by rubbing against the large fleshy leaves of succulent shrubs.</p><p>Another notable feature of crombec behaviour is its roosting ritual. Dusk is a good time to look for it because it draws attention to itself with its ratchet call, and darts about from one perch to another as though it cannot make up its mind where to sleep. It may use the same roost for several weeks, as I learnt one autumn when a crombec chose to sleep in the plane tree outside our kitchen door. It would spend several mi&#173;nutes ratcheting and darting about, then settle abruptly like an electric toy that has been switched off, instantly silent and motionless under the shelter of a dry, brown leaf that curled over its diminutive form like a parasol.</p><p>Long-billed Crombecs are monogamous and often build their nest in a bower-like site, suspended from a twig or trailing vine within a clear, shaded area enclosed by hanging, leafy branches. Different observers have variously described the nest as a bag, basket, cup, hanging purse or pocket. In fact it resembles a hanging pouch, the back of which extends up to the supporting twig. The important constituent in the nests of all ten crombec species is spider silk. It binds together all the other materials (such as leaves and plant fibres) and provides the bulk of the suspending segment. Construction engineers would applaud its choice because spider silk has the highest tensile strength (the measure of resistance to breakage relative to its diameter) of any known organic substance.</p><p>The nest takes a week or more to construct, but it may be double that time before the eggs (usually one or two) are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks and is shared, with the hen sitting for longer spells than her mate. While incubating, both sexes exhibit another crombec idiosyncrasy – they always sit facing the rear wall of the nest. For this position the short tail is an asset because it is not long enough to stick out over the front rim of the cup. The conventional position of incubating birds is to face forwards, thus obtaining a wide view of the nest surrounds and any approaching danger. The crombec’s unorthodox position seems to work well, however, for they are common enough, and the adult birds have an average lifespan of some seven years, with the oldest known individual being retrapped alive at over 12 years of age. &#9;</p>",

Instead it is placed in a genus of its own, Lophaetus, derived from two Greek words meaning ‘crested eagle’, a name that pinpoints this bird’s single most unusual feature. There is simply no other eagle in the world that has a crest that comes close to matching it – a sprout of floppy, seemingly meaningless feathers, 12 cm long, protruding from the top of the bird’s head, wafting when caught by a breeze and bobbing whenever the bird makes a head movement.</p><p>The crest certainly provides this eagle with an easily recognisable feature, and it is present in both sexes, even in juvenile birds, right from the time that they leave the nest. Perched birds appear to be uniformly dark chocolate in colour, but in flight extensive areas of white are revealed in the underwing and undertail, and as a flying bird banks, large white panels in the upperwing’s inner primaries become visible.

The birds are dependent on tall trees for perching, roosting and nesting, and on marshy bottomlands for hunting, and commercial afforestation of formerly treeless grasslands has extended their range in many places. They hunt by watching the ground below from a lofty vantage point and commonly use roadside telephone poles for this purpose. When prey is spotted on the ground the hunting bird drops off its perch and swoops down, talons extended to grab and immobilise the victim. These eagles specialise in hunting rodents and anything else that is caught – occasional birds, insects, reptiles – is entirely incidental. One study revealed that 98% of its prey comprised rodents of which 86% was made up by a single species, the vlei rat.</p><p>In the core of the bird’s range, pairs live in permanent territories, and one study in such an area revealed that the nests of adjacent pairs were 6-7 kilometres apart. Long-crested Eagles are found from time to time outside their normal distribution, though, and pairs sometimes become established here and breed, only to disappear a few years later. At the onset of breeding, pairs often call in flight, uttering a shrill whining ‘keee-ay’ as they circle their breeding area. They may also perform pendulum aerial displays high in the air, a bird gaining speed by swooping, then lifting, stalling at the end of its ascent, and swooping again to repeat the process. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is placed in a fork in the upper branches of a tall tree. It is insubstantial, and as often as not, is never reused; some are taken over by Black Sparrowhawks and African Harrier-Hawks, and the eagles may, in turn, make use of a nest originally built by either of these species. The timing of egg-laying is variable but there is a weak tendency to lay the clutch of two eggs in early summer, these hatching 42 days later, and the young fledging 53 days after this – for an eagle an unusually short nesting cycle.</p>",

In fact, the classification of the wider ‘black-backed cisticola complex’ has been a controversial and much-debated topic amongst ornithologists for decades. Five species are involved; of these, only Luapula and Rufous-winged Cisticolas occur in southern Africa. In terms of appearance, ecology and biology, these two species are very similar, but fortunately their ranges are widely separated, facilitating safe identification.</p><p>The Luapula Cisticola occurs in western Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Zambezi Region and extreme northern Namibia. Within its limited range, the most likely confusion risk is the Chirping Cisticola; the two species may occur together in emergent aquatic vegetation, but Chirping mostly prefers permanently flooded papyrus swamps, while Luapula is more common in reedbeds, rank waterside grassland and temporarily inundated vegetation on floodplains.</p><p>The Luapula Cisticola occurs in western Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Zambezi Region and extreme northern Namibia.

It is smaller than Denham’s, with browner and less distinct markings on the head and neck, and it shows less white in the folded wing panel.</p><p>Ludwig’s is an arid counterpart of Denham’s, with a distribution centred further to the west. It is virtually endemic to southern Africa and is found mainly in South Africa and Namibia, although its distribution extends marginally into the south-western parts of both Angola and Botswana, and it occasionally even enters Lesotho. Its primary habitat comprises the open plains of the Karoo and Namib but it also enters the fringes of the southern Kalahari and the drier western grasslands.</p><p>Ludwig’s is an arid counterpart of Denham’s, with a distribution centred further to the west.

Its primary habitat comprises the open plains of the Karoo and Namib but it also enters the fringes of the southern Kalahari and the drier western grasslands.</p><p>Like many desert birds, Ludwig’s Bustard is highly nomadic, seeking out the enhanced conditions associated with localised rainfall. But there is a little more to its movements than mere opportunistic nomadism. The range of the species encompasses both the winter and summer rainfall regions of southern Africa. There is strong evidence that the species is a partial migrant, with an appreciable segment of the population astutely shuttling between these two rainfall zones at the appropriate times of year to maximise the chances of locating ephemerally suitable foraging patches. Concomitant with this, Ludwig’s Bustard is a strong flyer, and the sight of singletons or small flocks powering overhead from one horizon to another is a characteristic Karoo spectacle.</p><p>The display of a breeding male Ludwig’s Bustard is similar to that of Denham’s, with the voluminous and dazzling white feathers of the chest and neck being erected to the size of a bedtime pillow. Ludwig’s differs from Denham’s in having a large brown diamond shape in the middle of this otherwise pure-white expanse of feathers, which is puzzlingly rather counterproductive to the overall effect. This still-startling exhibition is accentuated by a far-carrying booming call and drum-roll-like foot stamping that is audible only at very close range. Strangely, when females are attracted in close proximity to a displaying male, he typically keeps his back directed at them almost as if afraid to scare them away with the glaring prospect of a full-frontal exposure. I once watched two males on a low ridge overlooking the endless Karoo plains near Calvinia in the Northern Cape similarly displaying to one another in a highly ritualised and slow-motion but unmistakable turf war. These two dandies also kept their backs to one another and swayed deliberately from side to side. But there was no hint that either would stoop to the bar-room brawls that less showy Kori Bustards seem to regularly indulge in.</p><p>Ludwig’s Bustard was once a favourite quarry of hillbilly hunters but fortunately this dubious distinction seems to have waned in modern times. Far and away the greatest current concern is the vulnerability of this highly aerial and mobile bustard to colliding in flight with overhead power lines. The total population of the species has been estimated at some 56&#160;000 – 81&#160;000 birds. Studies of power-line collision rates suggest a staggering mortality rate of about one Ludwig’s Bustard killed per kilometre of line per annum. With over 16 000 km of transmission lines in the South African Karoo alone, coupled with even greater lengths of the smaller, but apparently just as deadly, distribution and telephone lines, and the reality that these overhead lines are increasing all the time, the obvious prognosis is exceedingly grim. And this ignores the Namibian situation, where the roll-out of electrical infrastructure is accelerating. Indeed, it is hard to understand how the species is still with us.</p>",

Macaroni Penguins are less agile ashore than rockhopper penguins, typically requiring a more sheltered landing site. They breed in dense, teeming colonies, sometimes numbering hundreds of thousands of pairs. Their countless comings and goings strip away all soil and peat, leaving a barren landscape that comes alive only during the short summer breeding season.

They have very stiff tail feathers which are used in a number of different ways. They are used for display by raising the tail vertically into the air while swimming; they use the tail to help swimming underwater; the tail is used as a brake when landing; and when swimming, the tail is held flat on the surface of the water.</p><p>The breeding male is a beautiful chestnut duck with a black head and neck. In non-breeding plumage it resembles the female which has essentially brown plumage with a conspicuous white stripe below the eye and a whitish-coloured patch below the cheek. The body is brown with wavy white lines. The body appears to be quite short and dumpy and the birds have remarkably large webbed feet, testifying to their aquatic lifestyle and the fact that they do most of their foraging by diving. On land the large feet and short legs are a distinct disadvantage, and the birds find it very difficult to walk around.</p><p>The breeding male is a beautiful chestnut duck with a black head and neck.

On land the large feet and short legs are a distinct disadvantage, and the birds find it very difficult to walk around.</p><p>This species is normally found in fairly deep wetlands with fringing emergent vegetation, especially the Typha spp. bulrushes. They seem to have considerable difficulty taking off from the water, having to run across the water to become airborne.  They are good flyers and will appear in any large pan which fills up following rains. At Voëlvlei and nearby pans in the southern Cape they appear when the pans fill; they breed and then seem to disappear as the pan starts to dry up. The Western Cape is one of two strongholds for this species, the other being the Highveld in South Africa. It is one of our least common resident duck species.</p><p>The birds feed by diving and sifting through material from the bottom of the pan (benthic feeding). The food is mainly small invertebrates, including the larva and pupa of aquatic species which occur in the mud at the bottom of our pans and dams.</p><p>They have one of the most interesting breeding methods found in the duck family, the displays by the male to the female often being prolonged and complex. The male, usually the dominant male in the area, has a fairly large territory which he advertises by swimming around with the tail held vertically and giving a deep vibrating purr-like call. It is sometimes described as a snoring call. The male may have up to eight females breeding at one time within his territory, and he has to both attract females as well as defend the territory against other males. The male may keep the territory operational for at least three months, depending on water conditions.</p><p>The female constructs a basin-shaped nest in emergent vegetation over deep water. She normally lays five to six very large eggs at intervals of one to two days. Nests with a larger number of eggs are likely to be from another female who has dumped eggs in the nest.  Relative to the size of the female, the eggs are exceptionally large, and the total weight of a clutch of eggs often exceeds the total weight of the female. It is noteworthy that both males and females need to build up fat reserves of up to 20-30% of their body weight before breeding starts, if they are to feed successfully.</p>",

They are also found in western Mozambique.</p><p>The group is territorial throughout the year and will drive away any other groups of Magpie Shrikes which dare to invade the territory. My observations of two groups near Marondera revealed that the groups ranged from a low of three birds to a maximum of eight birds at various times. However, the groups were usually four to six birds which seemed to be large enough for the group to fledge chicks successfully in early summer. If a group lost an early clutch, they would often build a second nest and produce a second clutch of eggs. Provided there was no really heavy rain the second nest would last long enough for the chicks to fledge.</p><p>They go around in a flock and because of their habit of sitting on a conspicuous perch from whence they can watch the ground below, they are easy to see and to identify. They have a musical ‘pee-leeo’ contact call which draws attention to the birds perched on the top of bushes and trees. The birds watch for movement on the ground below and when an insect, or possibly a small reptile is spotted, they drop down, landing next to the prey and grabbing it with the beak. I have watched one hop after a grasshopper which was trying to escape the bird. They seem to eat mostly insects, but they do catch small lizards which are held in one foot and torn to pieces with the bill. On one occasion I watched two shrikes raiding the nest of a lark which had small chicks. The adult larks tried to chase the shrikes away, but to no avail, and the chicks were dismembered and eaten.</p><p>The birds build a large, bulky cup-shaped nest and always site it in an acacia tree if one is available. In the open woodlands of Zimbabwe there are scattered acacia trees and if a group of Magpie Shrikes occupy the area, one would always find their nests in one of the acacia trees, not in the brachystegia species. The nests are so big and bulky that they are actually very conspicuous in the tree. Apparently the alpha male and female breed, and once the chicks have hatched all the birds in the flock come to feed the chicks. The group will leave one bird at the nest while the rest go off to gather food. The whole group returns together and the bird at the nest flies off. Although up to three birds may gather at the nest at the same time, the birds feed the chicks one after another before flying away. The last bird to feed will either settle on the chicks to brood them or, when the chicks are bigger and are starting to overflow the nest, the adult will just remain on guard in the tree near the nest.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Malachite Kingfisher, despite its small size, is probably one of the best known of our kingfishers, not only because it is common alongside so many rivers and at lagoons, but also because of its brilliant colouring. It occurs throughout much of southern Africa outside the arid regions, but penetrates the dry west along rivers, including the Gariep. The birds hunt from a low perch over the water, watching for fish and frogs below. While scanning downwards, the bird often bobs its head: this apparently helps it to see or perhaps aim at a prey item. When prey is spotted the bird aims with its beak pointing at the fish or frog. It then dives off the perch and grasps the prey in its beak, often returning to the same perch to eat its catch. When approached, a Malachite Kingfisher typically drops off its perch and flies low and fast across the water to another perch, usually around the first bend in the river. However, if approached by canoe or boat, they will often allow a close approach before darting off at high speed.</p><p>It is interesting that during the wet season, Malachite Kingfishers often move up rivers to pans and dams which are dry in winter. They retreat to the perennial waterways in the winter months to await the next wet season, which is when they breed. At this time they appear in large numbers in places like the Chobe River, where density is far higher than might be expected for a territorial species.</p><p>It is interesting that during the wet season, Malachite Kingfishers often move up rivers to pans and dams which are dry in winter.

At this time they appear in large numbers in places like the Chobe River, where density is far higher than might be expected for a territorial species.</p><p>The Malachite Kingfisher excavates a small burrow in a waterside bank; ideally, the bank is vertical or slightly overhangs the water, but if no suitable bank is present along the water’s edge, the birds will utilise banks away from water. At a large pan at Swartvlei in the southern Cape, where the edge of the lake is lined with sedges and reeds and there are no shoreline banks, the birds nest some distance from water. I have even observed them nesting in a bank in a man-made hole used as a rubbish pit. Being the only bank in the area, this pit also supported pairs of Pied and Brown-headed Kingfishers nesting at the same time. Like the bird, the nest hole is very small and is easily overlooked. The birds fly very rapidly when going to and from the nest, although they always stop en route at a perch from which the nest is visible.</p><p>This species has been photographed carrying frogs which look huge relative to the size of the birds and their chicks, especially the latter. Frogs, like fish, are always carried head outwards so that the food can be pushed head first into the chick’s mouth. This is absolutely essential in the case of fish otherwise the spines of the fish would get stuck in the chick’s throat.</p><p>Although adult birds have a bright red bill, when the chicks emerge, their bills are dusky. Their plumage is also much duller than that of the adult. For some weeks after they emerge from the nest they are fed by the adults on perches along the river’s edge. At this stage both adults appear to spend their entire day provisioning the seemingly ever-hungry chicks.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The distribution of this bird is discontinuous from Ethiopia south through East Africa to Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Zimbabwe this species is restricted to the Eastern Highlands and is isolated from other populations. In South Africa it is found from Limpopo and North West provinces south through Mpumalanga spreading out to encompass a large area from KwaZulu-Natal across through the Free State to the Western Cape, then extending northwards entering Namibia marginally on the lower Orange River. The highest densities occur in alpine grassland and fynbos, followed by various Karoo habitats, but they may be found in a wide variety of other vegetation types, if only seasonally, when nectar is readily available.</p><p>This is a highly visible sunbird with the attractive males in breeding dress usually in a prominent position on the top or side of a bush. It is also one of the sunbird species in which the male moults into a dull eclipse plumage which may be seen in any month from January to June, depending on the population’s breeding regime. This is a large sunbird with a long bill and can often be identified on these features alone, but where it and the Bronzy Sunbird occur alongside each other in Zimbabwe there might be confusion as they are the same size. The females and immatures may be separated by the streaky underparts of the Bronzy.</p><p>This is a highly visible sunbird with the attractive males in breeding dress usually in a prominent position on the top or side of a bush.

The females and immatures may be separated by the streaky underparts of the Bronzy.</p><p>The movements of this bird are often difficult to discern, especially as the bright male goes into its dull eclipse and may be easily overlooked. Ringing studies have shown that there is considerable dispersion, and some local migration occurs in different areas. Earlier atlassing suggested a movement out of the drier western areas and a partially complementary movement into the south-eastern Cape between November and April, but this is not supported by any ringing evidence. Movements are generally less than 200 kilometres and related to seasonal changes in any one area whether these be through seasonal aridity, altitudinal to escape severe winters, or dependence on the local flowering of favoured food plants.</p><p>At the beginning of the breeding season males stake out their territory by perching on top of bushes and calling loudly. They are very aggressive towards any other males and often towards males of other sunbird species. Once a female has joined the male, he will follow her on trips to collect nest material but never takes part in nest-building. The nest is usually hung from a small branch about 1-1.5 m above the ground, sometimes at the edge or sometimes just inside a bush. The nest is an oval about 150 mm high, with a side entrance at the top. There is usually some sort of projection of thin ‘sticks’ above the entrance. The nest material is held together by spider web – the female may bring the spider-web separately, or may take a piece of grass to a spider’s web and wrap the grass in the web to make it sticky. The outside of the nest looks ‘old’ when it is constructed, perhaps to fool potential predators, and the entire nest can take two weeks to construct, with the first egg usually laid within a matter of days of the final lining of the nest. Eggs take about 14-16 days to hatch, and the chicks spend about 15-20 days in the nest before fledging. It is interesting that although the male does not help with building the nest, nor with incubating the eggs, he does help to feed the chicks.</p>",

It appears that we have both resident and migrant populations, with the birds along the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast being resident, and birds in the Eastern Cape being summer migrants.

It is interesting that during this southward migration, some of the birds overshoot and one bird was photographed in George in October one year.</p><p>Although their name suggests that they are mostly found in Mangrove Swamps, this is far from being the case. In summer they are most likely to be found in forest or woodland along rivers – normally with trees which have a suitable hole for nesting. They have been recorded as using the abandoned nests of woodpeckers and barbets. In winter they may move inland – over 100 km in Mozambique. They feed on a variety of prey, including fish and crabs along rivers, grasshoppers, beetles and other insects in the woodlands.</p><p>Their loud, chattering call which gets faster towards the end is conspicuous. It has been rendered as ‘ting-ting-ting….’ or ‘kling-kling-kling...’. Another loud call may be rendered ‘tchi-tchi-tcha-tcha-tch-ch-ch-ch’, the call accelerating and descending slightly towards the end. They call mostly when nesting. I have only watched this species at Wavecrest, where in early spring they are both vociferous and conspicuous. The estuary at Wavecrest has extensive mud banks with mangroves which are exposed at low tide. These mud banks are full of small crabs, and one can sit in a boat and watch the Mangrove Kingfisher dropping down to pounce on crabs coming out of their burrows. The bird then returns to a perch and bashes the crab against the tree before eating it. They have also been recorded as catching small fish, lizards and various insects such as grasshoppers and beetles.</p><p>Breeding pairs select a territory along the river which is large enough to provide food for the pair and their nestlings. The nest is usually in a hole in a tree or occasionally in a hole in a bank. The nest hole is normally the hole excavated by a barbet or woodpecker, and the birds seem to prefer nests which are high in the trees rather than down near the water. Very little has been recorded about their breeding in southern Africa and because of their limited distribution and population, they are considered Vulnerable in South Africa, especially to habitat loss and degradation.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Perhaps because of their size (they stand up to 1.5 metres tall), balding pates and frequently hunched stance, we see in Marabou Storks characterisations of people we have known or met at one time or another. By our standards they are not handsome birds – in fact the Marabou is thought by some to be the ugliest bird in the world. But beauty (or ugliness) is very much in the eye of the beholder. Whatever Marabou Storks may lack in looks they more than make up for with smart behaviour and a successful lifestyle.</p><p>On the ground these birds stalk about solemnly, ever on the lookout for a potential meal. An adult consumes up to two kilograms of food per day, and more than that during the breeding season when there are chicks to feed. The pouch that hangs from its neck was initially thought to be for food storage, or to act as a pad on which the bird could rest its long and assumedly heavy beak. But the beak is surprisingly light, and the pouch is, in fact, a functional air sac which acts as a heat exchanger and also signals dominance in social interactions. The long legs are also efficient heat exchangers; they contain lots of blood vessels, and the stork squirts excrement onto them to provide evaporative cooling when needed. This habit results in the Marabous, like White Storks, appearing to have whitewashed legs.</p><p>On the ground these birds stalk about solemnly, ever on the lookout for a potential meal.

This habit results in the Marabous, like White Storks, appearing to have whitewashed legs.</p><p>These storks are first and foremost scavengers, and are almost always present with vultures at large carcasses. Some storks stand around until an individual vulture has gorged itself. A threat from a stork then forces the vulture to regurgitate its rapidly ingested meal, which the Marabou promptly grabs and swallows. In Equatorial Africa these storks commonly associate with humans and gather at slaughter houses, fish markets and rubbish dumps.</p><p>They are also opportunistic hunters, gathering at bush fires to catch mice and other animals fleeing from the advancing flames, or stalking about in the smoke and ashes behind the fire front to feast on the seared victims. Seasonal or periodic flooding of ephemeral wetlands also offers them the opportunity to catch animals fleeing the advancing water, and they exploit the subsequent drying up of such areas that concentrate fish and amphibians into ever-shrinking pools.</p><p>Marabou Storks can do many things with their big beaks. They fish by immersing the partly open beak in water and evidently locate their prey by touch as well as by sight. They use the beak as a spear, for example when stabbing an adult flamingo in the back, or as a bird net when surrounded by Red-billed Queleas (Marabou Storks are almost always present at quelea breeding colonies). Grabbing a quelea out of a dense flock might seem a simple task, but a Marabou Stork has also been seen to catch a low-flying Barn Swallow that made too close a pass to it, so these storks can be surprisingly deft with those big beaks. And, like so many other members of the African fauna (including man), they seldom pass up an opportunity to catch and eat ‘flying ants’ (termite alates).</p><p>They are superb fliers, whether soaring majestically in thermals, gliding unerringly toward target areas, or effecting controlled vertical descents onto large carcasses, long legs dangling, and the 2.6 metre span of their spread wings showing scarcely any movement. If threatened or attacked, a Marabou can achieve instantaneous vertical takeoff with seemingly effortless ease, despite its 4-9 kg weight. &#9;</p>",

The Marico Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the fine-leaved acacia woodlands, but has also been recorded in mixed woodlands containing mopane.</p><p>While the Pale Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the central and north-east of southern Africa, the Marico Flycatcher is generally a bird of the drier west, although it does extend eastwards along the Zimbabwean plateau where acacia woodlands are found. It is interesting that where land has been cultivated and then abandoned, the acacia trees are the most important pioneer tree species, and quite extensive areas of acacia woodland are, therefore, found in the agricultural areas of the plateau. These acacia woods are colonised by the Marico Flycatchers once the trees have reached sufficient height to create woodland with plenty of food. Under these circumstances it is not uncommon for Marico Flycatchers to be in the acacia woodlands and Pale Flycatchers in the uncut miombo woodlands nearby, but the two species seldom occur together in the same habitat.</p><p>Marico Flycatchers are insectivorous, catching and consuming most of their prey on the ground unless the insect is too large to be swallowed whole. They seldom carry such prey back up to the same perch from which they have flown down to catch the insects. They have also been recorded as hunting for prey amongst the leaves and in the creviced bark of the acacia trees.</p><p>The birds usually occur in pairs and appear to be resident and territorial throughout the year. Evidently they can become very tame in camping sites located within their favoured area. One can be sitting on a chair and have the flycatcher land on the ground right next to one, to catch an insect. It was interesting to see them foraging on the ground which we had cleared of leaves and other debris for the erection of our tents in the Kalahari. It would appear that our clearing of the ground for the setting up of a camp revealed hidden prey, so the flycatchers spent a lot of time in the camp area. These birds will sometimes fly up from a perch to hawk flying prey, but usually they are ‘perch-and-pounce’ predators.</p><p>While the Pale Flycatcher builds quite a substantial nest, the Marico Flycatcher builds a much thinner and less conspicuous nest. This could be as a result of the bird nesting in acacia trees which are less dense in terms of foliage than the broad-leaved trees. The nest is a small cup made up of bits of grass and apparently thin twigs, lined with finer material, and held together with a certain amount of spider web. Sometimes the nest construction is so thin that one can see the eggs through the bottom of the cup. In Zimbabwe, like any of the woodland birds, this species usually starts nesting when the temperature starts to rise in August and September and insects start hatching out in considerable numbers. However, unlike some of the other species, this species will continue nesting right through into December and January, despite the heavy rains having started. There are usually two or three chicks, which are fed caterpillars and other small insects.&#9;</p>",

It is locally common where suitable habitat occurs. In the Kalahari basin it is estimated that this species occurs at a level of one to two birds per hectare. It is a bird which is normally associated with acacias, not only in acacia woodland, but also in other open mixed woodlands with scattered acacia trees. It may also be recorded in woodlands along rivers, and it has become a garden bird in many areas. In our visits to the Makgadikgadi area of Botswana we found these sunbirds to be very common in a wet summer but comparatively rare in the same area in August when it was very dry.</p><p>The male has an iridescent green head, throat, breast and back. The wings and tail are blackish brown. The double collar is blue above and dark red below, and the black-looking belly is actually a very dark grey.

They are quite noisy birds, often singing for minutes at a time. Their song consists of a rapid series of high-pitched ‘tsip-tsip-tsip’ notes which usually start with their ‘chip-chip’ call note. A second song consists of a series of chip notes rendered at a rapidly increasing speed.</p><p>Marico Sunbirds normally occur in pairs, although one may also encounter single birds. Small groups, probably family parties, are recorded in summer. However, if a suitable nectar source is located, many of these birds may gather there from the surrounding area. A Weeping Boer-bean tree Schotia brachypetala in flower, attracts all species of sunbirds and, in my experience in Zimbabwe, this is often the only time one is aware of the presence of the Marico Sunbirds in a particular area, as they are not common on the plateau.</p><p>Like all sunbirds, they are nectar feeders. Nectar provides energy, but little to no protein, so all nectarivores also need to feed on insects and spiders. Marico Sunbirds are no exception, and they can regularly be seen capturing insects in flight and gleaning them off leaves and branches.</p><p>The birds usually start nesting in response to rain, particularly in the Kalahari when widespread rain creates a flush of insects which help to bring the birds into breeding condition. In Zimbabwe the birds start nesting in spring during the time that the flush of insects occur, when temperatures warm up in September and October.  The birds build a typical sunbird’s nest with the entrance at the side and near the top. The nest is usually placed in a thorny bush or tree at no great height above the ground. It is interesting that this species has been recorded as using the same nest twice in one season, which is unusual for sunbirds.</p>",

It is restricted to the African continent where it occurs widely from the Cape to North Africa. During winter, populations occurring north of the Equator come into contact with a second closely similar ground-living species, the Short-eared Owl, a species that breeds in the Palaearctic and migrates into northern Africa in the non-breeding season. And across the rest of Africa it lives in places alongside another much scarcer terrestrial-living owl, the African Grass Owl.</p><p>While mainly crepuscular and nocturnal hunters, Marsh Owls are diurnal to some extent during winter, and on the odd occasion they may emerge in broad daylight after a rainstorm to partake in the temporary feast offered by emerging termite alates. Their usual hunting technique is to fly a metre or two above thick grass at near-stalling speed, head facing down, every now and again changing direction, banking and quartering a different area. When prey is detected the bird does a quick aerial somersault and plunges into the grass. If successful, it emerges soon after with prey; if not, the quartering continues as before. Large prey items, a bird, frog or rodent perhaps, are taken to a mound or fence post to consume, whereas a beetle or other small item may be swallowed while on the wing. Their low-flying hunting technique has the unfortunate consequence that these birds frequently become caught on barbed-wire fence lines where they die a lingering death as they gyrate about trying to disentangle their ensnared wing.</p><p>While mainly crepuscular and nocturnal hunters, Marsh Owls are diurnal to some extent during winter, and on the odd occasion they may emerge in broad daylight after a rainstorm to partake in the temporary feast offered by emerging termite alates.

Large prey items, a bird, frog or rodent perhaps, are taken to a mound or fence post to consume, whereas a beetle or other small item may be swallowed while on the wing. Their low-flying hunting technique has the unfortunate consequence that these birds frequently become caught on barbed-wire fence lines where they die a lingering death as they gyrate about trying to disentangle their ensnared wing.</p><p>Marsh Owls frequently call while hunting, making a rasping croak, a sound not unlike tearing up sheets of paper – a ‘gggk, ggkkk, gkkkk, kk’ – and it is this call that sometimes alerts one to their presence, both while the bird is on the wing and when it is on the ground, hidden in grass. Nesting birds, if disturbed, become particularly demonstrative and will circle around the intruder, repeatedly uttering the rasping note. It is a sure sign that they have chicks if they land nearby and flop about on the grass, bill-snapping and making whimpering or squealing sounds. In flight, especially during a territorial conflict between two birds, these owls may also clap their wings loudly together. By contrast, when not breeding these owls often roost communally, and it is not uncommon to put up ten or twenty birds from a small area of dense grass.</p><p>Breeding occurs mainly from late summer through the winter, and the spot where a bird has been roosting regularly sometimes becomes the site of the nest. Unusual for an owl, this species makes a nest of sorts, lining the shallow nest scrape with dry grass stems, and in damp situations a quite substantial nest bowl may be constructed. The site chosen is invariably in dense grass which effectively conceals the nest from above, and it is only by seeing the incubating bird fly out that one is likely to locate the nest. The eggs, 3-4 on average, are plain white and they are incubated entirely by the female. She, and later the nestlings, are brought prey at intervals by the male who has to up his hunting effort during this period to cater for the extended family, and he may range a kilometre or more from the nest in hunting sorties. Once the eggs have hatched and the nestlings start growing, the female assists in provisioning the brood, while the chicks disperse from the nest well before they can fly, hiding in nearby grass while waiting for food.&#9;</p>",

It usually feeds by wading in shallow water, but sometimes ventures into deeper water up to its belly. It typically captures prey by picking them from near the water surface, but occasionally scythes through the water or probes soft sediments. It also accompanies other birds, including ducks and Ruffs, using them as beaters to stir up its prey.</p><p>In its rather plain, grey and white non-breeding dress, it is often confused with the Common Greenshank. It is much smaller and slimmer, however, lacking the Greenshank’s robust appearance, and has a much finer, straighter bill. When flushed, its take-off call is less strident than that of the Greenshank. In flight it is also similar to the Greenshank, but tends to have a whiter looking tail with less bold barring. Superficially it can also look similar to a winter-plumaged Wilson’s Phalarope, but has much longer legs and has a white stripe up the back clearly visible in flight. Occasionally one is fortunate to find a bird in breeding dress just prior to departure in March when its upperparts show a beautiful spangle of pale buff and black, and there are heart-shaped black marks on the sides of the chest that merge into chevrons on the flanks.</p><p>In its rather plain, grey and white non-breeding dress, it is often confused with the Common Greenshank.

Most birds winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but eastern birds also visit India through south-east Asia to Australia. They tend to be thinly dispersed, with seldom more than 100 birds at one wetland. As with many sandpipers, it is difficult to estimate total numbers, with around 100&#160;000 birds thought to visit Africa each summer.</p><p>Being such a southerly breeder, most adults leave here in February-March, probably staging on the saline Rift Valley lakes of East Africa before arriving back on the breeding grounds in late April. Breeding is over by July, with immatures and unsuccessful breeders returning to East Africa in July. Most moult before reaching southern Africa in September-December. Very small numbers of juvenile birds overwinter in southern Africa, but larger numbers do so in East Africa. Ringing studies have shown that non-breeders tend to return to the same wetlands in successive seasons. There has been one long-distance recovery of a bird ringed in East Africa in April recaptured at a sewage works in Gauteng in January nearly three years later.</p><p>There are indications of a general population decline through agricultural intensification throughout its breeding grounds. Some recovery has been noted in the more westerly breeding areas, but these are not sustained, and the number of breeding birds fluctuates annually. In Russia there has been a gradual northward spread brought about by the creation of extensive grazing areas, but the populations in steppe habitats have suffered the most rapid decreases. Several other species of waders breeding in this habitat also have suffered declines.</p>",

But this very wide range and very broad cross section of habitats that it frequents belies the fact that it is, mostly, a scarce bird, occurring at very low densities wherever it is found. Furthermore, its occurrence outside of large conservation areas is much fragmented, and it is essentially absent from wherever the hand of man has transformed the natural environment by urbanisation, settlements, agriculture, afforestation and the like. In South Africa its stronghold is the Kruger National Park, but even in this untransformed and protected area of nearly two million hectares, the magnificent Martial numbers only about 130 breeding pairs.</p><p>Martial Eagles are broad-shouldered, thickset birds with a 2.2 metre wingspan, their wings uniformly broad across their length, and having long legs and large, powerful talons. Females, weighing on average 4.7 kilograms, are a little larger than males and are recognisable by being more heavily spotted in front. The bird’s head shape is very distinctive, with a short crest that imparts a square-headed profile, and they have piercing yellow eyes that appear to glare fiercely from below deeply hooded eyebrows.</p><p>Martial Eagles are broad-shouldered, thickset birds with a 2.2 metre wingspan, their wings uniformly broad across their length, and having long legs and large, powerful talons.

The bird’s head shape is very distinctive, with a short crest that imparts a square-headed profile, and they have piercing yellow eyes that appear to glare fiercely from below deeply hooded eyebrows.</p><p>These eagles probably spend much of their day in the air, cruising effortlessly at great heights, and over large distances. There are numerous sight records of the birds coming down after prey from such heights. They initially descend in a rapid shallow dive, then accelerating in a low, fast final approach near the ground before veering up, talons extended, to snatch the unsuspecting victim from the ground. The bird’s eyesight is certainly exceptional, as one such observation of a successful strike described how the eagle began its descent towards a flock of guineafowl when it was six kilometres from them. In many areas guineafowl feature strongly in the Martial Eagle’s diet but many larger bird species, including storks, bustards, herons and geese, may be taken. In arid areas mammals such as meerkats, ground squirrels and hyrax often make up the bulk of the prey, while in parts of its range monitor lizards are the single most commonly hunted prey.</p><p>Given its penchant for gamebirds, it is not surprising that Martial Eagles are disposed to taking free-ranging poultry around settlements and farmsteads, and herein lies one of the reasons for the bird’s decline outside of protected areas. Many are shot in farming areas, especially the inexperienced immature birds that have not honed their hunting skills and find chickens irresistible. Others die from secondary poisoning by preying on guineafowl that have been poisoned to keep them off crops, and unknown numbers die annually from electrocution by alighting on hazardous electricity-bearing poles that criss-cross many farming areas.</p><p>Breeding takes place in winter, with the lengthy nesting cycle commencing in March or April when repairs begin at a previous year’s nest. Nests that are reused each season become ever-larger structures, measuring up to two metres wide and one and a half metres high; some pairs, though, build a new nest every few years. Favoured nesting sites are in a high fork of a large tree growing at the head of a valley or at the base of a cliff, with increasing numbers now nesting, especially in the Karoo, on the top crossbars of electricity pylons. The single egg is usually laid in May or June, and the time taken from laying to fledging is about five months. Given this lengthy process, followed by a similar period in which the fledgling is dependent on its parent for food, pairs often skip years between breeding, and the resultant recruitment of young to the population is low, varying between 0.2-0.5 young per pair per annum.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Vocal mimicry – one species imitating the voice of another – is a phenomenon that has interested birders, ornithologists, bio-acoustic scientists and even neurobiologists for decades. Mimicry is extremely widespread in birds, with some estimates claiming that 15-20% of passerines exhibit this fascinating behaviour. Robin-chats are well known and celebrated for their mimetic prowess but mimicry is also practised by larks, shrikes, warblers, starlings, sunbirds, white-eyes, thrushes, wheatears, chats, whydahs, indigobirds and canaries. Birds such as parrots, crows and mynas are adept at mimicking human speech. With the possible exception of the Marsh Warbler, my personal vote for the most accomplished mimic in southern Africa would go to the Melodious Lark.</p><p>This easily overlooked endemic is restricted to the moist, mid-altitude grasslands of South Africa and adjacent Botswana. Its centre of abundance is focused on southern Gauteng, the Free State and the North West Province. A smaller isolated population occurs on the central plateau of Zimbabwe. The Melodious Lark occurs in sweet and mixed grasslands at an altitude of 550-1750 m and with annual rainfall of 400-800 mm. Its preferred breeding habitat consists of open, fairly sparse grassland, usually 30-50 cm in height on flat or gently sloping ground. It is particularly fond of areas dominated by the grass species Themeda triandra, recognisable by the reddish tint and the triangular shape of its seed heads.</p><p>This easily overlooked endemic is restricted to the moist, mid-altitude grasslands of South Africa and adjacent Botswana.

It is particularly fond of areas dominated by the grass species Themeda triandra, recognisable by the reddish tint and the triangular shape of its seed heads.</p><p>In optimal habitat, Melodious Larks breed in semi-colonial densities, often with several pairs per hectare. Indeed, breeding activities are usually localised to small areas within a larger landscape of suitable habitat. Within these frenzied hubs, males perform extended energetic display flights: rising to a height of 15-50 m, the male hovers into the wind with its plumage puffed up – like a giant bumble-bee. During such display flights, the male sings almost continually, sometimes for half an hour or more at a time.</p><p>The territorial display is accompanied by a sustained composition consisting of imitations of other birds. Imitations are delivered in short snippets that require a quick ear to recognise. Each male’s repertoire includes imitations of an estimated 30-50 species and in a brief analysis, 71 species were identified in the repertoires of one population of males. Interestingly, adjacent males appear to exhibit song matching when singing simultaneously, continually adapting their songs to mimic the same species at the same time as their neighbours. In addition, they seem to favour copying specific species, and the African Quailfinch, Little Swift and African Pipit in particular, are mimicked more often than other birds. Field observations even suggest that other species are mimicked in logical groups, for example groundbirds like lapwings, francolins and quails, aerial feeders like swifts and swallows, and waterbirds like ducks, plovers and sandpipers.</p><p>After breeding, Melodious Larks become secretive and unobtrusive and their movements are poorly understood. They feed on the ground, their conical bills being suitable for a diet of both insects and seeds. This species is threatened by agriculture, overgrazing, frequent grass fires, bush encroachment, urbanisation and mining, all of which result in the degradation of its sensitive habitat. Evidence suggests that its historical range has already contracted. South Africa’s grasslands would be much impoverished without the lively mimicry of this unique endemic.</p><p>The question of why birds practise vocal mimicry has not been answered satisfactorily, despite exhaustive research. The function of mimicry also varies depending on the species and situation: it might deter predators, incite mobbing behaviour or establish mixed foraging flocks. Other proposed functions of mimicry include maintaining group cohesion, inter- and intra-species territoriality and attracting mates by increasing the size and complexity of the singer’s repertoire – the latter is likely the case in the Melodious Lark.</p>",

Watching this starling run, it appears that the long tail helps to ‘balance’ the bird. The dark eye and crossbarring on the tail are reminiscent of Burchell’s Starling, but this species is appreciably smaller with a much longer, narrower and strongly graduated tail. Again, like Burchell’s Starling, juveniles have matt black underparts, lacking iridescence. There have been three records of birds with uniform pale grey plumage, one of which also had pale yellow eyes, closely resembling Tanzania’s Ashy Starling L. unicolor. However, all were in groups with normal Meves’s Starlings, and these birds merely appear to be a rare aberrant plumage variant. Such abnormally coloured individuals may be more vulnerable to predators, so it is interesting that they seem to be accepted by members of their own species. One individual had some white wing feathers, but otherwise normal plumage and eye colour.</p><p>Meves’s Starling is very local in our region. It is closely associated with Baobabs and tall mopane woodland, and can be locally common (e.g. in the Hwange region of north-west Zimbabwe). Usually found in small groups, it often forms large roosts in trees during the dry season, and also associates with other starlings. Feeding mainly on insects, these birds sometimes use large mammals including elephants as ‘beaters’, catching prey disturbed by the mammals.</p><p>Meves’s Starling is very local in our region.

Occasionally more than one pair may nest within a single large tree, but the nest entrances are well separated.</p><p>They nest in cavities at least one metre above the ground, usually in a tree hole, but occasionally in fence posts and pipes. Both birds deliver plant material to form a pad at the bottom of the nest cavity, but no feathers appear to be used in the nest lining. If the nest is reused, the old material is removed. Pairs may raise two broods in the same season, and may return to the same nest site in successive years. Only the female incubates, and as in other long-tailed birds, strongly curved tail feathers provide a clear indication that the bird is currently on eggs. Both sexes feed the nestlings. Meves’s Starling is an occasional host of the Great Spotted Cuckoo, and adults have been seen attacking cuckoos, driving them away from the nest area.  Destruction of old trees by elephants and firewood collectors can result in the loss of nest sites for this species and for other hole-nesting starlings.</p>",

The eastern race transvaalensis differs from the western damarensis in a prominent yellow crown patch which is usually absent, or at least greatly reduced, in the latter. But some individuals of the former, especially males, either lack or possess only a vestigial crown patch. In addition, damarensis has an even stronger bluish tint to the turquoise underparts and rump than transvaalensis. The two forms meet in northern Botswana. This species was thought to hybridise ‘widely with Brown-headed Parrot and occasionally with Rüppell’s Parrot, but recent insights suggest that many alleged hybrids merely reflect plumage variation.</p><p>Meyer’s Parrot has the widest range, and likely the broadest habitat tolerance, of all African parrots. It occurs from southern Africa as far north as Sudan. It is the archetypical parrot of many of Africa’s drier savannas and is attracted especially to taller riparian growth. Like most parrots, it is noisy, and its harsh screeching calls often comprise a double-note duet between mated pairs.</p><p>Meyer’s Parrot has the widest range, and likely the broadest habitat tolerance, of all African parrots.

Like most parrots, it is noisy, and its harsh screeching calls often comprise a double-note duet between mated pairs.</p><p>In terms of diet, this parrot is an opportunistic generalist, and the most detailed study, by Steve Boyes in the Okavango, showed that the seeds, fruits, pods and flowers of 37 tree species were exploited. Favourite Okavango food trees included Sausage Tree Kigelia africana, Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis, Red Star-Apple D. lycioides, Leadwood Combretum imberbe, Russet Bushwillow C. hereroense, Sycamore Fig Ficus sycomorus, and Bird Plum Berchemia discolour. A particularly fascinating finding was that during the breeding season these parrots incorporate a signifi&#173;cant proportion of beetle, moth and even fig-wasp larvae in their diet. These come in the form of plant parasites feeding inside fruits and pods. Meyer’s Parrot is apparently the only bird within its range capable of readily accessing this resource. Relevant to its propensity for fruit, it is a master at switching from one temporarily abundant food supply to another. It seems to prefer hard seeds and nuts to soft fruits, and ingestion of the last seems largely a side effect of feeding on the first two as a seed predator. It fancies unripe plant material, which apparently allows it to avoid competition with other frugivores. Its unique ability to process the pre-dispersal seed pods available from leguminous trees gives it a monopoly on this often abundant food resource. Like many other parrots, it sometimes raids citrus orchards as well as maize, sorghum and millet fields.</p><p>Breeding occurs in late summer to winter and is timed to exploit peak food production, especially of its arthropod prey. Warwick Tarboton was the first to note that when feeding chicks the adult hangs upside down near the nest hole, apparently to facilitate regurgitation.</p><p>In the Okavango, it was the only cavity-nesting species breeding during winter, allowing it to avoid competition for nest cavities typical of hole-nesting avian communities. Favourite nest trees include Knobthorn Acacia nigrescens, Musasa Brachystegia spiciformis, Leadwood Combretum imberbe, Real Fan Palm Hyphaene petersiana, Mopane Colophospermum mopane and Baobab Adansonia digitata. Woodpeckers and barbets are the primary excavators of favoured cavities, but natural holes are also used. Trunks or branches with cavities are characteristically dead, and under natural circumstances elephant damage appears important in promoting availability of suitable nest cavities for parrots and other hole nesters. However, eradication of tall tree cover (e.g. along the Chobe River) by overpopulation of these pachyderms, may be detrimental.</p><p>Nests in the Okavango were under severe predation pressure, and confirmed villains in this regard were African Harrier-Hawks Polyboroides typus, Large Spotted Genets Genetta tigrina, Black Mambas Dendroaspis polylepis and Tree Monitors Varanus albigularis. Meyer’s Parrots are highly attuned to the alarm calls of Tree Squirrels Paraxerus cepapi. The species is apparently far less common in northern South Africa than ancestrally, due to the destruction of tall woodland.&#9;</p>",

This call immediately identifies the bird. They also have a song made up of a mixture of notes which may be rendered as ‘chip-chirrew-chip-chirrew…’.</p><p>Outside of the breeding season this species normally occurs in small to large flocks. At Peterhouse on the Zimbabwe plateau, the bird was quite common in the woodlands but it was interesting that in autumn the flocks would usually feed right out across the open playing fields at the school. Clearly, the grass had grasshoppers or other insects which attracted these starlings, for some months, at the end of summer. These flocks would often also include Greater Blue-eared Starlings which stood out because of their larger size. Normally the birds forage on the ground within the woodlands, looking for grasshoppers and beetles and also for fallen fruit and ants. They are known to feed on nectar in flowering Schotia trees and also in aloe flowers. It was conspicuous that they would gather in large numbers at termite alate hatches, flying up from the ground or from a perch, to catch an alate in flight and then returning to the ground or the perch to eat it.</p><p>The birds split up into pairs in the spring and became conspicuously territorial at this time. The males’ eyes changed from orange to red once they had paired off. They would make use of almost any suitable hole whether it was a natural rot hole, often caused by a branch breaking off, or a woodpecker hole. They preferred the medium-sized woodpecker holes such as those of the Bennett’s Woodpecker because the Cardinal Woodpecker hole was too small for them. We also found that they would readily make use of nest boxes put up for hole-nesting birds. When photographing this species it was noticeable that for a number of days after the chicks were fully feathered, they would remain in the nest and come to the entrance to be fed. Once the chicks left the nest they would follow the adults and beg for food. The rufous-breasted juveniles then joined up with the flocks of adults and moved around the area with them until the following breeding season.</p>",

Until relatively recently this miomboendemic was thought to be a race of the Southern Double-banded Sunbird, but taxonomic studies now show it to be a separate species, locally common on the Zimbabwean plateau, and extending marginally into the western Mozambique highlands and to north-eastern Botswana.</p><p>Further studies of Zambian populations divide this species into two further species which live alongside each other.

As our knowledge increases, more almost identical species will no doubt be found. This is an example of a bird group in which each species is adapted to a specific ecological situation, details of which are not always clear.</p><p>The highest densities of this sunbird are found in the Eastern Districts of Zimbabwe, where it occurs up to an altitude of about 2&#160;200 metres and frequents miombowoodland. Few birds penetrate the more arid woodlands and they are absent from lowveld valley systems, which appear to act as a barrier to movement. Although typically a bird of the miombo it does not appear to be particularly common in unbroken stands of such woodland, apparently preferring partially fragmented woods, although not favouring small, isolated stands. It has adapted to some of the more wooded city suburbs and well-vegetated farm gardens, where it tends towards more sedentary behaviour. It is also found, perhaps seasonally, in montane forests in the east, and it may visit acaciawoodland when mistletoes are in flower.</p><p>It is generally resident, but some local and nomadic movements occur, the extent of which are not known. The longest movement recorded to date from a ringed bird is a mere 25 kilometres. Although there is no distinct pattern to movements, they appear to be related to the previous season’s rainfall, with a proportion of the population moving out of areas that have received little rain. The generalised pattern at one ringing station showed a gradual build-up of numbers from March, reaching a peak in June and gradually dropping off in July, with most of the birds departing from their winter nectar sources in August. Recaptures of ringed birds showed that the pattern of individual occurrence varied annually and that birds ringed in some years showed a greater tendency to return in later years, while those ringed in other years showed a poorer return rate. During the winter months these sunbirds wander in search of suitable nectar-bearing plants and may even find those growing at remote and isolated sites. They may concentrate at such sites with other sunbird species, but they retain the characteristic restless sunbird behaviour and do not appear to remain for long, although some may return within a short period of time. There is always continuous turnover of individuals at such sites.</p><p>Having no confusingly similar species in Zimbabwe, the adult males are always easy to identify, although many do go into a partial eclipse plumage in which the head becomes browner. The females may be confused by observers with females or immature birds of the grey-bellied forms of the White-bellied Sunbird, while the young juveniles may be confused with a short-billed female or immature Variable Sunbird, even in the hand, having yellow underparts for a few weeks after fledging.</p>",

It also occurs in north-eastern Tete Province in Mozambique. Its habitat is typically well-developed miombo (Brachystegia) and other broad-leaved woodlands such as Zambezi Teak Baikiaea plurijuga. Its tolerance to habitat transformation is low, and the birds are sparse in disturbed woodlands. The fragmentation and clearing of miombo woodlands in Zimbabwe is cause for concern, especially as the species does not seem to be well represented in protected areas anywhere. At my study site in central Angola, the birds were frequent, but not common, in climax miombo woodland, and similarly were frequent, once again not common, at my study site at Cusseçe near N’Gola further south in Angola. This was in early spring and the Miombo Tits were usually alone or in pairs. At other times of the year they are frequently encountered in mixed-species foraging flocks, and in areas of Zimbabwe where miombo woodland abuts Acacia woodland, such flocks may also include Ashy Tits.</p><p>Miombo Tits forage on tree trunks and large and small branches, generally favouring dead branches, but also forage on live trunks and branches in some areas, gleaning food items from lichen patches and crevices in the bark.

Their food is poorly known, but includes caterpillars and other insect larvae and spiders.</p><p>In the Marondera area in Zimbabwe, Miombo Tits and Southern Black Tits are focal species of the mixed bird parties. Southern Black Tits typically are more numerous than Miombo Tits, but there are usually five or six of the latter in each party. Both species keep in touch all the time with soft, but penetrating calls. Other birds apparently listen to the tits’ calls because when the tits change direction so do the other birds, and if the tits or one of the drongos sound the alarm, all the birds disappear into the nearest foliage.</p><p>The breeding biology of the Miombo Tit is poorly known. The birds are thought to breed co-operatively in certain circumstances, perhaps when food is sparse and scattered and a team effort enhances the chances of finding sufficient food to feed the nestlings. However, the circumstances which determine whether to breed co-operatively are not known, and could be social rather than environmental. The nest is a pad of hair and plant fibres, shaped roughly into a cup, in a natural cavity or old woodpecker or barbet nest hole in a tree, or in a steel-pipe fence post, occasionally in a nest box, or rarely, a hole in a termite mound. A nest found at Great Zimbabwe was in a Msasa (Brachystegia spiciformis) tree, in a typical site where a branch had broken off, leaving a deep cavity, with the actual nest a pad of soft material at the bottom of the hole. The bark and xylem layer of the tree had subsequently grown over the cavity, but not completely, and the tits were able to use the nest cavity by entering through a narrow slot. Miombo Tits lay three to five eggs, averaging just over three eggs to the clutch. Incubation duties, development and care of nestlings and food given to nestlings are unknown, but are likely to be similar to that recorded in Grey and Ashy Tits. There are some data on breeding success, and in miombo woodland at Lake Mutirikwi in Zimbabwe, 75% of Miombo Tit nests produced fledged young, averaging two young per nesting attempt.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Mocking Cliff-Chats are found almost throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The distribution in southern Africa is mainly eastern, from south-eastern Botswana and Zimbabwe south through eastern South Africa and Swaziland to the eastern parts of the Eastern Cape Province. They are probably not common anywhere, but they are resident in most places and can always be seen there. In some areas, for example the Drakensberg, Magaliesberg and other sites on the interior highlands, Mocking Cliff-Chats move to lower altitudes in the winter. It has been suggested that these movements are driven by the loss of leaves from deciduous trees rather than food shortages. Their habitat is the fairly closed riverine woodland in rocky ravines and gullies, and more open woodland or scattered trees below cliffs, boulder-strewn hillsides and the large boulders along streams or rivers in valley bottoms. The birds are usually seen in pairs or family groups, often bounding or running over rocks and along branches, or disappearing into passages and tunnels among boulders, and then reappearing some distance away. Their tolerance to habitat transformation is high, and the birds become tame around human settlements, especially farmsteads where there are old stone walls or ruins of stone buildings.</p><p>Foraging behaviour and food of the Mocking Cliff-Chat are poorly known. The birds use a drop-down technique, perching and then pouncing on prey on the ground below, and also search branches and foliage, gleaning food items from the bark and leaves. Only broad categories of food have been reported – insects and fruit – and the birds are known to feed on the nectar of the Krantz Aloe Aloe arborescens. The natural food for nestlings has not been recorded in detail but it has been reported that nestlings were fed on small lizards, and on white grubs, probably beetle larvae.</p><p>Foraging behaviour and food of the Mocking Cliff-Chat are poorly known.

The song duets are aggressive, and precisely synchronised: a rich, clear, powerful fluty warble. In the courtship flight the male zigzags across cliff faces and between trees, displaying the white shoulders and singing loudly. The nest is built by both sexes, a cup of antelope or hyrax hair on a base of leaves, twigs, roots and feathers, usually inside an old nest of a striped swallow (sometimes a new nest, the rightful owners being evicted) under a rock overhang or in a cave.</p><p>The entrance to a Red-breasted Swallow nest is large enough for the chat to enter, but both the striped swallow nests need modifications. Greater Striped Swallow nests need about 30 mm of the end of the entrance tunnel broken off for the chat to enter, but a Lesser Striped Swallow nest needs to have the entire ‘narrow part’ of the tunnel broken off before the chat can enter. Mocking Cliff-Chats do this by flying up and grasping the end of the tunnel in the feet and then falling backwards to pull off pieces of the structure, and this is repeated until the opening is large enough. Mocking Cliff-Chats also nest in cavities in disused agricultural machinery, and regularly nest under the eaves of farmhouses in Zimbabwe. Usually three eggs are laid, varying from white, cream, pale green or bluish green, more or less spotted or speckled with pale reddish brown and mauve. Incubation is by the female only, sitting for long periods during the day in cool weather and all night, and for a very long shift of two to three days just before the eggs hatch. Both adults feed the nestlings. &#9;</p>",

Although quite different in vocal qualities, these two larks are similar in appearance but the former lacks the prominent white eyebrow of its cousin. Both characteristically puff out a conspicuous white throat patch when singing from elevated perches. The Monotonous Lark also indulges in brief fluttering display flights, during which the plumage is erected in the manner of bishops.</p><p>Good rains in the fairly dry woodlands inhabited by the species are the magic ingredient that drives an almost miraculous rise to its prominence, when its calls rapidly come to dominate the local auditory landscape. This lark is also highly irruptive, abruptly arriving to breed in large numbers well outside its usual range following exceptional rains. Carl Vernon noted that under the right conditions up to eight singing males may be visible from a single spot. After a few months this rain-fed bounty is typically exhausted and the woodlands again fall silent. The birds may not revisit the same area for years, reflecting the erratic nature of rainfall in the drier savannas. The lack of subspecific differentiation in this lark further mirrors its highly mobile ways. Such an itinerate lifestyle is a radical departure from most other Mirafra larks, indeed from insectivorous larks generally, which are typically sedentary.</p><p>Good rains in the fairly dry woodlands inhabited by the species are the magic ingredient that drives an almost miraculous rise to its prominence, when its calls rapidly come to dominate the local auditory landscape.

The truncated and staccato phrase, likened to “for-syrup-is-sweet”, is repeated ad nauseam day and night throughout the brief breeding period. It has been equated with the croaking of frogs when heard at a distance. The song is given from perches, during display flights and even while foraging on the ground. One male uttered its song 1&#160;090 times during a single hour in the morning, once every 3-4 seconds, but perhaps even more remarkable was that a rate of 476 songs/hour was maintained through the middle of the day! Perhaps the nomadic existence of this lark is implicated in the simplicity and repetitive nature of its song. There may be pressure to respond quickly to sudden and unpredictably suitable conditions, and the very direct and unambiguous song and singing effort may reflect this need for a rapid escalation into breeding mode. Totally unexpectedly, the most recent research has revealed that Monotonous Larks actually do have the ability to occasionally mimic the calls of other conspicuous birds that share their habitat, although the implications of this are as yet unexplored.</p><p>The breeding system of this lark has been studied by Derek Engelbrecht and Joe Grosel during one irruption near Polokwane in northern South Africa. The precipitous mass arrival of the birds resulted in initially highly promiscuous mating, with the males trying to copulate with as many females as possible. They, however, provided no further parental assistance to the resultant nesting attempts pioneered by these females, likely linked to the uncertain paternity involved. The taxing load on males in terms of the incessant singing, energetic display flights, frantic pursuit of females and endless scuffling with other males seemed to take an early toll on the least fit among them, and these weaker males deserted the demanding breeding grounds when not immediately successful in attracting mates. Later, as the initial reproductive frenzy subsided and some males began abandoning the breeding grounds, a second cohort of females formed the traditional monogamous unions with males that are more typical of the family. The males in these instances closely guarded their mates to ensure paternity and provided assistance in the ensuing nesting attempts, including help with feeding insect prey to the young.</p>",

There are no recoveries of ringed birds to show exactly where the migrants to southern Africa come from, nor how many arrive here each year, but they are considered to be scarce visitors. Males of the two species can be distinguished by wing and underpart markings but females and immature birds are very much alike, so much so that many books describe them as ‘indistinguishable in the field’.

It and the Damara Hornbill has the smallest range of all southern Africa’s hornbills. This species occupies the driest habitat of any hornbill species anywhere in the world! It is usually associated with dry, hilly country with woodland or scrub, especially along the Namibian escarpment but some move onto flat country where there are scattered trees during the winter. The birds are known to move around in response to rain.</p><p>Its occurrence in any area is probably determined by the presence of suitable food such as small rodents, insects, fruit and even small bulbs which it digs up with its bill. During the breeding season it has been recorded as taking armoured ground crickets, highly poisonous parabuthid scorpions, centipedes and a gamut of different insects. They even catch fast-running and poisonous solifuges. They also eat chameleons, skinks and frogs, and small nestlings of birds up to the size of a Laughing Dove.</p><p>Its occurrence in any area is probably determined by the presence of suitable food such as small rodents, insects, fruit and even small bulbs which it digs up with its bill.

The nest is a natural hole in a tree or a rock face, but even in the latter sites, the nest entrance is sealed by the female once she is inside, prior to egg-laying. Material used for sealing the nest entrance, which is supplied by the male, sometimes includes millipedes, which are crushed before being combined with the ‘mortar’. Two to eight eggs are laid per clutch and incubation starts with the first-laid egg, resulting in chicks of varying ages and sizes within a single brood. This in turn leads to a dominance hierarchy within the brood, the largest chicks being fed first and most often; as a result of this hierarchy, the survival of chicks is very much dependent on the food supply. &#9;</p>",

The white rump is appreciably narrower, and the tail has distinctive small spines which extend beyond the end of the feather webs.

It was previously called the Long-tailed Wagtail, a name that readily distinguished it from the other two endemic African wagtails occurring in our region (the Pied Wagtail and the Cape Wagtail). The migrant Grey Wagtail from Europe, however, has just as long a tail, and it is considered a close relative of the Mountain Wagtail, but is only a vagrant visitor to southern Africa.</p><p>Mountain Wagtails are almost always associated with running waters in both streams and rivers, but what sets them apart from other wagtails is that they usually live along streams in evergreen forests. ‘Forest Wagtail’ could, therefore, be an appropriate English name for this species in South Africa, but in Zimbabwe, where forest habitat is largely confined to the eastern highlands, these wagtails frequent woodland streams. Stream spates may force them to seek alternative foraging sites, and I have seen a pair feeding along a vehicle track through a wattle plantation, but such dry-ground foraging activity is rare in this species.</p><p>Mountain Wagtails are almost always associated with running waters in both streams and rivers, but what sets them apart from other wagtails is that they usually live along streams in evergreen forests. ‘Forest Wagtail’ could, therefore, be an appropriate English name for this species in South Africa, but in Zimbabwe, where forest habitat is largely confined to the eastern highlands, these wagtails frequent woodland streams. Stream spates may force them to seek alternative foraging sites, and I have seen a pair feeding along a vehicle track through a wattle plantation, but such dry-ground foraging activity is rare in this species.</p><p>In Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, pristine Mountain Wagtail habitat occurs in escarpment mist-belt forests and in the forested kloofs of the coastal hinterland, especially where there are cascades or waterfalls over outcropping rock strata. In rural areas such streams are usually clear and clean, but they may become muddy with silt loads after heavy rainfall in eroded areas. In suburban landscapes such streams are likely to be polluted, and flooding (due to run-off from streets and storm-water drains) may be more frequent.</p><p>The water quality influences the territory size of the Mountain Wagtail. Territories are ‘linear’ (long and narrow) because the stream and its banks and the flanking vegetation provide everything that these wagtails need – food, nesting sites and cover. In optimum habitat (clean, perennial streams), the length of stream from which a breeding pair excludes all others of their kind may be as short as 370 m. On less perfect, run-of-the-mill streams, the defended length may exceed a kilometre, while along wooded Zambezi escarpment streams in Zimbabwe, some 800 m is the usual real estate length that breeding pairs defend.</p><p>A foraging pair of Mountain Wagtails is a delight to watch. They move upstream or downstream quite rapidly, wading foot-deep (sometimes belly-deep) through water flowing over sheet rock, probing here and snapping at some flying midge there, their tails bobbing exaggeratedly, with the two birds seldom more than a few metres apart. Fledged young accompany their parents, so one may encounter three to five birds in a foraging group in the latter half of the breeding season.</p><p>Mountain Wagtails are double-brooded in good habitat where they have a comparatively high breeding success rate. This results in a floating population of individuals that cannot easily find a vacant territory and are constantly on the move. Such individuals may have to wait a few years before replacing a member of the breeding population for whom the average lifespan (estimated at a study site in KwaZulu-Natal) is 6.9 years.</p>",

One of the walls had quite a big gap in it and it was in this gap that the Mountain Wheatears had a nest. The female, a black bird with white rump and tail, was feeding quite small chicks and was going to and from the nest every few minutes. She usually landed on top of the wall somewhere near the nest, flew down to a flat stone in front of the nest, fed the chicks and flew away completely ignoring us, and the sheep milling around the kraal.</p><p>Males of this species come in one of two colour variants! These are called morphs. One of them is a handsome black-and-white bird, the other is a grey morph, and it is an even more handsome and striking bird. The grey morph male’s entire body is a very clean grey, reminding one of the grey suit once favoured by the businessman.   It also has white tail coverts and a certain amount of white on the tail. Many of them have a conspicuous white patch on the shoulders, which enhances the grey overall colour. The black morph is essentially black in colour with white on shoulder and tail.</p><p>Males of this species come in one of two colour variants! These are called morphs.

In the rocky areas they may be very common and their black/grey-and-white plumage is very conspicuous. They are restless birds, moving from one perch to the next in search of prey. They will fly down from a perch and forage on the ground between the rocks looking for insects and other similar prey. Here again they always seem to be on the move as they hop here and there along the ground, catching ants and other arthropods. Their diet is recorded as including a huge variety of insects, spiders and other invertebrates. They are also able to fly up and hawk flying insects with relative ease.</p><p>Like all the chat family this species becomes remarkably tame when in association with man. Many rest camps and camping sites in the Karoo have pairs of this species living amongst the cottages and tents. These birds will come readily to be fed on tasty things such as grated cheese!</p><p>The males have a loud trilling call which is very noticeable in the wild, but perhaps less so in camps where other noises tend to drown out the call. The birds usually call from a perch, but may also do so in flight. This call has been described as a series of jumbled notes, ‘tsi-tsuru-wi-tsi-wi’. These wheatears are also experts at mimicking other birds which occur in their vicinity, and often include these imitations in their own trilling calls.</p><p>In most areas Mountain Wheatear pairs maintain territories throughout the year, one ringed pair being recorded together for three years. Breeding often occurs in response to rain - good rains result in an increase in insect life in the semi-arid Karoo. The female constructs the nest, starting with a foundation of various bits and pieces of rubbish, including twigs, small stones, various seeds and old flowers etc. In the top of this collection of material she fashions a cup of no great depth and lines it with warm material, including sheep’s wool when available. The three eggs take about fourteen days to hatch and the young then spend another fourteen to eighteen days in the nest before fledging and joining the adults in foraging around the nest, gradually going further and further afield.&#9;</p>",

This behaviour has been recorded by others, but usually when there have been small chicks in the nest.</p><p>Habitats occupied by Namaqua Doves are mainly dry woodlands, particularly dry Acacia savannas, also arid and semi-arid shrublands, trees fringing drainage lines in desert areas, fallow croplands, and farmyards and rural gardens. In villages they also forage along road verges. The doves are occasionally present in thickets of alien trees, but are most common in native woodlands, perching in ones or twos, sometimes in small groups, on open, leafless or dead branches, usually low down.</p><p>They forage on open ground, on gravel roads and on the edges of tarred roads, quietly walking about and pecking. Despite their abundance and extensive range, their food is surprisingly poorly known. What is known is that they eat almost exclusively tiny seeds, especially those of grasses, sedges and ‘weeds’. The very small, black and shiny seeds of pigweeds (the plants also known as Prince’s feathers and needle burrs) seem particularly attractive as food items.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Easily recognised by their long, pointed tail feathers, their olive-yellow coloration closely matches the stony landscapes of the Great Karoo, the southern Kalahari and the Namibian escarpment. North-western populations are mostly nomadic, while south-eastern populations are more migratory, gathering in Bushmanland and the Karoo to breed. Where they co-occur with Burchell’s Sandgrouse, they usually inhabit rocky, calcrete areas while Burchell’s Sandgrouse prefer sandy Kalahari dunes. Although they differ in habitat choice, the two species mix at drinking spots.</p><p>Their daily schedule begins with flocking to dust-bathe near their regular drinking site and then moving on to feed. So precise is this schedule that flocks arrive predictably at a water hole one to two hours after sunrise. In the evening, they fly to roost in stony areas, where each bird makes a shallow scrape in which to spend the night.</p><p>Their daily schedule begins with flocking to dust-bathe near their regular drinking site and then moving on to feed. So precise is this schedule that flocks arrive predictably at a water hole one to two hours after sunrise. In the evening, they fly to roost in stony areas, where each bird makes a shallow scrape in which to spend the night.</p><p>Their characteristic three-note call, ‘ki-ki-vee’ or ‘kel-kie-wyn’, is heard while flying to their drinking site or while on their way to feed. The flock is usually high in the sky and difficult to link with the call. The take-off call is a rapid ‘kip-kip-kip-kip’, and birds also give the ‘kip’ calls while strutting on the ground at a watering site.</p><p>They feed on tiny, hard, protein-rich seeds of annual legumes that flower in response to erratic rains. These seeds closely resemble the sand particles within which they are sprinkled. The crop can contain thousands of seeds after a day’s foraging. Grit is also eaten to help grind up the seeds in the gizzard. Feeding birds walk slowly with their head bent forward, making rapid pecks at the ground. They do not scratch for food with their feet, but will flick the sand with their bill.</p><p>Favoured drinking sites have gently sloping, open banks which offer valuable fresh water while keeping a watch for predators, especially raptors. The flocks land several metres from the water, where they socialise, or run down to drink. The breeding season sees ‘belly-wetting’, when males take water to flightless chicks in their belly feathers. The male fluffs out his specially adapted breast and belly feathers while standing in the shallows and dunks them in the water with a bobbing action.</p><p>They are monogamous, solitary nesters, but are not territorial. In the north the breeding season is from January to August, peaking in May in Namibia and the Kalahari, while further south they breed during September to November in Bushmanland, and September to February in Namaqualand and the Western Cape. The nest is a simple scrape in sparsely vegetated calcrete or sand and is placed next to stones or a grass tuft for camouflage of the incubating bird. Incubation is shared, with the camouflaged hen sitting during the day, and the more colourful male incubating at night. Incubation of the three-egg clutch lasts 21 days, after which the chicks hatch synchronously. They are precocial, leaving the nest and feeding on tiny seeds soon after hatching. However, they rely on their parents for shelter from the sun, provided largely by the female, and a supply of water, provided by the male. When threatened near eggs or young, the adults perform injury-feigning distraction displays, giving a churring call.</p><p>Large flocks that once visited drinking sites in the Northern Cape have dwindled since the 1940s. This may be due to an increased number of boreholes, allowing the birds to spread out over a greater area. However, a potentially serious problem is predation on eggs by Yellow Mongooses Cynictis penicillata and Common Egg-eaters Dasypeltis scabra. Mongoose predation may have been heightened by a reduction in mongoose predators, especially large raptors such as Martial Eagles. Furthermore, where telephone lines and fences cross their flight paths to access water, many birds collide with these seemingly invisible obstacles, often causing fatal injury.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>One of the most distinctive sounds emerging from riverside vegetation in the Karoo is the characteristic churring trill of the Namaqua Warbler. It is a very common and familiar bird at our indigenous plant nursery, where a small, almost permanent, stream creates a mini-marsh, with fireweeds, willow weeds, rushes and reeds providing the ideal habitat for the species. Namaqua Warblers are widespread in the Succulent and Nama Karoo, and are most often (but not always) associated with drainage lines that have some permanent water, either seeping out of a rock outcrop or from a spring in the riverbed. Although superficially similar to the Karoo Prinia, the Namaqua Warbler is more petite and combines rusty-brown upperparts with whitish underparts, lightly streaked with dark brown on the chest. Its habits are similar to the Karoo Prinia (with which it sometimes overlaps), but its main habitat differs, as does the nest and eggs.</p><p>Namaqua Warblers are endemic to western South Africa and extreme southern Namibia, where they occur only along the Orange River, and a short distance north along the Fish River. The distribution in South Africa is along the lower and mid Orange River south to the Succulent and Nama Karoo, and east to the western Free State and Eastern Cape. The species is resident with some local movements. For example, in Prince Albert, where a furrow system leads water through gardens and along the streets, Namaqua Warblers follow the furrow in winter, foraging in gardens and, at times, in adjacent trees.</p><p>Namaqua Warblers are endemic to western South Africa and extreme southern Namibia, where they occur only along the Orange River, and a short distance north along the Fish River.

The species is resident with some local movements. For example, in Prince Albert, where a furrow system leads water through gardens and along the streets, Namaqua Warblers follow the furrow in winter, foraging in gardens and, at times, in adjacent trees.</p><p>The usual habitat of the species is acacia woodland and reed beds (Phragmites), fireweeds (Conyza), honey-thorn thickets and vegetation immediately adjacent to watercourses in the Karoo. The birds also favour rank, overgrown orchards adjacent to irrigation canals and gardens. Namaqua Warblers forage by gleaning from branches, twigs and leaves in tangled vegetation and among flood debris, and rarely on the ground under dense cover. Food items include tortoise beetles (Cassidae), weevils, bugs (Hemiptera), ants, small wasps, insect egg cases and small fruits.</p><p>Rank, rather tangled vegetation is important for nest sites. Nests are placed up to about 1.5 metres above ground (or water) in tall grasses, thorny shrubs, reeds, African thistles (Berkheya species) or, frequently, in flood debris against a small bush on a riverbank, usually in a shaded site close to water. The birds are strongly territorial, and in our area nests are usually spaced about 100 metres apart along a watercourse. In optimal foraging and nesting habitat nests are sometimes much closer, and can be as close as 20 metres apart. The nest is a deep cup, quite unlike that of a prinia, and this was one of the main reasons why the species was moved into its own genus (a move subsequently confirmed by genetic analyses). The nest has an untidy foundation of shreds of bulrush leaves, dry grass, roots, rootlets, dry, sometimes skeletonised leaves, strips of bark and other plant material gleaned from flood debris. The nest site is often dark, and the nest hard to see, but nevertheless the birds camouflage the nest with bits of bark, dead leaves, lichen and twigs. The nest cup is warmly lined with feathers, fluffy seeds and rootlets. The eggs are bright blue, spotted and blotched with various browns. The incubation duties and parental care are unknown. The birds are sensitive when nesting, and will easily desert nests at the building or early egg stage.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This must be the bird most sought after for its beauty in southern Africa, and the colours of the male, particularly that crimson breast, really are striking. Angola Pittas are also beautiful but restricted to a very limited area, whereas trogons can be found in most forest patches from the Cape’s Grootvadersbosch to the Zambezi. At the same time it generally requires a good deal of patience and perseverance to locate a trogon and see it clearly. Unfortunately, they have a nasty habit of showing none of the red and presenting the birdman with a green back view only. The bird can be seen to be watching you with both eyes because, like an owl, trogons can easily turn the head through 180º but still the red chest and belly will be facing away. Eventually securing that ‘tick’ for your list always gives a sense of achievement.</p><p>Trogons occur most plentifully in the New World with 24 species occurring in their tropics, and there are another dozen species between India and the Philippines. Africa has only three species, the others being the Bar-tailed Trogon of montane forest distribution and the Bare-cheeked Trogon which keeps to the depths of primary lowland forest. Our trogons live on large items of living prey: caterpillars, tree frogs, geckos, etc., whereas the western birds eat a lot of fruit. The neotropical birds also often excavate their own nest holes, whereas our African birds use natural hollows despite their strong hooked and notched beaks. The oriental birds sport a lot more brown and yellow in their plumages but lack the iridescence and shine to their nevertheless striking colours.</p><p>Trogons occur most plentifully in the New World with 24 species occurring in their tropics, and there are another dozen species between India and the Philippines.

They are primarily associated with forests but occur in many lowland riverine strips. In summer they also extend into parts that support well-developed mopane trees but they are not resident in the mesic woodland on the Zimbabwe plateau. While the colours of these birds are most exciting, they are very dull in their behaviour. They sit still for long periods and you seldom see them unless they fly across the road in front of you. They are easiest to locate when they are calling, that is from September through to December. But there is a lot of green in these forests which camouflage the bird, and so one has to look for the tail moving in order to locate the bird. The tail moves about 40 mm back and forth with each ‘whroo-whroo, whroo-wroo’ call.  This goes on for twenty to thirty seconds at a time at about three double notes every five seconds.</p><p>But the best way to see trogons is to visit a trogon area at sing-song time. Dr Brosset of Gabon talked of Un chanson des trogons.  This is apparently a feature of the behaviour of some trogons in each of the continents on which they occur. For a few weeks before the breeding season two or three males get together in the same tree and give their ‘whroo-whroo’ calls. But they don’t stay in one place. They move through the forest gathering more recruits as they go until there are as many as six or seven birds. Some birds fall out and go back to their nesting territories but others join, and the group will cover a kilometre and more in a morning.</p><p>The trick is to get to the right forest, during the right weeks, at the right time of day and to be in the right place to intercept them on their route for that day. Then there are trogons all around you for three or four minutes. ENJOY!</p>",

They are common in a variety of habitats, from savannas and woodlands to coastal forests. They have expanded their range along watercourses invaded by the alien Black Wattle Acacia mearnsii. They are particularly fond of dry riverine vegetation and wooded hills, extending into montane forest edges. They are tolerant of modified habitats and regularly forage at the edges of cultivated lands where these are adjacent to cover. They also forage along firebreaks cut through commercial plantations. They are found alongside the bolder Swainson’s Spurfowl and the more secretive Red-necked Spurfowl, sharing road verges and the edges of agricultural lands with the former, and forest edges and moister sites with the latter.</p><p>Although coveys can contain up to ten birds, Natal Spurfowls are usually seen singly because coveys are loose and individuals scatter when they detect an intruder. They aggregate where food is abundant, such as at livestock feedlots where waste grain is available. When disturbed, they normally run into thicker cover, or flush as individuals rather than as a covey, flying a short distance before falling back into cover. A flushed bird will often land on a concealed perch, where it will freeze, hoping to avoid detection. Like most spurfowls, they fly rather than walk to their overnight roosting sites, thus avoiding being tracked by predators. When used to the presence of people, such as at camp sites, they often become tame, keenly accepting and even soliciting food items. The advertisement call, ‘kak-keek, kak-keek, kak keeeeek’, given mostly at dawn and dusk, is remarkably similar to that of the Cape Spurfowl and is often the only evidence that this species is in the area. They also use a high-pitched, mewing call to make contact when covey members are separated.</p><p>Natal Spurfowls usually feed during the early morning and late afternoon, typically foraging under the cover of vegetation. Like other spurfowls, they scratch in leaf litter and loose soil to expose food items. Small bulbs, roots, seeds and fruits make up the bulk of their diet, but they will also take fallen grains such as sorghum and maize. During the summer they also feed on beetles, termites, grasshoppers and caterpillars. A favourite foraging habit is to scratch through rhinoceros and elephant dung for undigested seeds.</p><p>The breeding season is extended, particularly in the north, where breeding has been recorded throughout the year. Peak breeding is during mid- to late summer (December to February) in South Africa and during late autumn (March to May) in Zimbabwe. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with roots and grass and is generally well concealed beneath dense, tangled scrub. The clutch of 5-7 eggs is incubated by the female only (based on observations of captive birds), with incubation lasting 21-22 days. Chicks can flutter-fly at 10-14 days. The hen is very protective of her brood and will confront any threat with wings spread and raised.</p><p>There are currently no concerns regarding the species’ conservation. Perhaps the only potential threat is habitat modification and fragmentation by tree felling and frequent burning, which has led to reductions in their numbers in parts of South Africa.&#9;</p>",

Its extensive distribution encompasses all but the most arid parts of the region, and it is common in a variety of habitats, including the edges of suburbia. Furthermore, its monotonous but far-carrying song is almost inescapable in summer, but is seldom recognised by laymen, who often attribute the sound to an insect.</p><p>Novice birders likewise struggle with identifying this minute species as it lacks distinctive field marks save for a rufous-washed crown.

Eight subspecies are recognised in total, although the differences between these are often subtle, and adjacent subspecies tend to grade into one other.</p><p>Identification difficulties and potential pitfalls aside, the Neddicky is a charismatic, entertaining and usually quite confiding species. It is fairly catholic in its habitat choice, as long as there is sufficient grassy cover interspersed with bare patches for terrestrial foraging. In natural situations it is common in mountain Fynbos, clearings in coastal bush, at forest edges, in scrubby valleys, in light woodland, and in savanna with a well-developed understorey. However, it is also fairly adaptable to human activities and seems equally at home in modified habitats such as scrubby roadsides, edges of plantations, and lawns and tended gardens in safari camps, parks and even large suburban gardens. Its use of altered habitats has allowed it to extend its range in recent years, such as in parts of the naturally treeless Highveld.</p><p>Another essential habitat requirement is the presence of tall, dead trees, telephone wires or other high, exposed perches from where it delivers its repetitive song. And it is this song that is the best clue to its identity: a very small, nondescript bird singing fearlessly from a telephone wire or the exposed dry twigs at the very top of a tree will more often than not turn out to be a Neddicky. In more open landscapes they also sing from the tops of prominent rocks and shrubs.</p><p>Most birders will be familiar with the Neddicky’s dry, rattling alarm call, reminiscent of a finger nail being drawn across the teeth of a comb, or a bag of marbles being vigorously shaken. From personal experience I can assure readers that it’s a good idea to heed such warnings: while walking through some worryingly overgrown grassland a pair of Neddicky suddenly appeared in front of me and started giving frantic alarm calls. At first I assumed their protests were directed at my presence, but I still had the good sense to check the surrounding grass carefully, only to discover a superbly camouflaged Puffadder Bitis arietans concealed virtually at my feet.</p><p>The Neddicky is likely to be encountered singly, in pairs or, after breeding, in small groups. Much of its time is spent foraging on the ground, where it moves erratically, often twitching its tail. It also hunts in or amongst low bushes and in dense grass, where it searches for termites, ants, moths, grasshoppers, mantids, beetles, and caterpillars and other insect larvae. When available, it will readily drink nectar, but it has seldom been recorded drinking water. It is also frequently seen in mixed bird parties – temporary alliances in which members of several species aggregate to form foraging flocks, especially in the dry season. &#9;</p>",

The males of both forms are highly distinctive bustards, with strongly contrasting pied plumage, bright red beaks and brilliant chrome-yellow legs. The females are more cryptically coloured and essentially mottled brownish throughout except for their black bellies. The two species differ most obviously, in both males and females, when seen in flight, the primaries of the present species being mainly white, while those of its southern counterpart are uniformly black.</p><p>The Northern Black Bustard is entirely endemic to southern Africa. Nevertheless, it vies with another (virtual) endemic, the Red-crested Bustard, as the most widespread bustard species in the region (based on bird-atlas data).

The habitat choice of the species is similarly fairly broad, comprising grassy areas of the Nama Karoo, the drier western grasslands, Kalahari and lightly wooded savanna.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a wide expanse of the central Karoo situated between the respective ranges of the Northern and Southern black bustards where neither species occurs. The only place where they apparently meet (and seem to occasionally hybridise) is where the valley of the Great Fish River cuts through the Winterberg Mountains that separate the two species just south of Cradock in the Eastern Cape.</p><p>The Northern Black Bustard has three subspecies and varies quite substantially in appearance across its expansive range. The birds found in the driest north-western parts, e.g. at Etosha Pan, are much paler, with slightly broader and almost white barring on the upperparts, in comparison with birds in the more mesic grasslands in the south-east of its distribution, which show marginally narrower and browner bars on the upperparts.</p><p>The behaviour of the males is even more distinctive than their appearance. The harsh rattling call, a characteristic sound of their stamping grounds, is ear-splitting at close range and is given over protracted periods during the extended summer breeding season. It may be uttered from the ground, where the bird often takes stance on a prominence, typically a termite mound. More characteristically though, the call is delivered during a particularly raucous and commanding display flight, which ends with the bird parachuting back to earth with its brightly coloured legs dangling. When calling on the ground and in the air the male typically raises the slight crest at the rear of its crown, as well as the other feathering of its head and neck, which imparts to its head a decidedly bulbous and flat-topped appearance. During the peak of the breeding season, the calling rate of the male may reach an exhausting 210 times per hour and can continue well after dark.</p><p>During the winter months, harvester (Hodotermes) termites are a favourite dietary item of these bustards, and one stomach contained no less than 3 808 of these insects.</p><p>The breeding habits of this characterful bustard are similar to the other solitary members of the family. The species does not form pair bonds, and the female shoulders the responsibility for rearing the young entirely by herself. One to two richly coloured coffee-brown to olive-green eggs, laid in a scrape on the ground, comprise the usual clutch, although clutches as large as four have been claimed.</p><p>This charismatic little bustard is not considered threatened but at one stage it was being exported in frightening quantities from Botswana to meet a shameful demand from Middle-Eastern falconry quarters. One dealer apparently had over 500 birds at one time ready for shipping.</p>",

It is the only giant petrel at the New Zealand sub-Antarctic islands, but breeds on the same islands as Southern Giant Petrels at South Georgia, the Prince Edwards, Crozets, Kerguelen and Macquarie. The two species differ in breeding season and habitat (see Southern Giant Petrel), but occasional hybrids have been recorded. Both species use a mix of scavenging and predation to secure food. Some adult males are predatory at Tristan da Cunha, catching and killing Northern Rockhopper Penguins at sea, grabbing them by the back of the head and holding them underwater until they drown. They have also recently been recorded killing albatross chicks at the Prince Edward Islands. Off southern Africa, Northern Giant Petrels are most abundant around fishing vessels at the shelf break, but they also come close inshore, especially at seal and seabird colonies, where they greatly outnumber Southern Giant Petrels. Although they are killed occasionally on fishing gear, and have been impacted by introduced predators at a few islands, populations at most sites are stable or increasing, probably as a result of the increase in fur-seal populations and the associated increase in the amount of carrion.</p>",

It was thought that these birds were migrants from Madagascar, but the birds in Madagascar also appear to be resident. Interestingly, this population was recorded breeding as far south as Richard’s Bay in KwaZulu-Natal in 1928, but there are no recent records of breeding in South Africa. A vagrant, probably from the Namibian breeding population, was found on the lower Olifants River near Vredendal in the Western Cape in July-August 2002.</p><p>Although Olive Bee-eaters are locally common, their total population in the region is fairly modest, with fewer than 10&#160;000 breeding birds. They are usually found in open riverine woodland. They typically occur in groups of 5 to 15, hawking insects from conspicuous perches, usually near water. They are reputed to catch a lot of bees, but when I was watching this species in Mozambique, it was clear they caught many dragon&#173;flies too. Larger prey items like dragonflies are beaten to a pulp on a perch to which the bird returns with the prey, thus enabling one to get a look at the food being taken. They also bathe frequently, dipping into water in flight then returning to their perch to preen. They roost in reed beds or other water-side vegetation, with large numbers gathering to roost in favoured locations in the Zambezi Valley.</p><p>Olive Bee-eaters breed in small colonies of 10 to 50 pairs, although some larger colonies of up to 400 pairs have been recorded. The greeting display between mates involves much wing-raising to show off their striking rufous underwings. Both sexes help to dig the 1-2 metre long burrow where they lay 2-4 white eggs. When breeding, they behave much like the other bee-eaters in that they are tied to the bank or bare ground where the nests are excavated. Once the chicks fledge they move away from the nests and feed over a much wider area. In autumn, some flocks consist of more than 50% young birds of the year that have not attained full adult colouration.</p>",

These calls, which can be heard throughout the year, are not only characteristic, but also loud, and they aid location of the bird in the forest canopy. Like other bush-shrikes, the Olives also have some harsh calls, and their alarm call, a guttural ‘grog’ or ‘gok’ or ‘tsok’ is difficult to tell from the similar alarm call of the Gorgeous Bush-Shrike.</p><p>At one of our mist-belt homes we regularly heard Olive Bush-Shrikes calling, especially in fine, sunny weather the day before a cold front brought clouds and rain. I could not detect any instrumental change in barometric pressure or in relative or absolute humidity, yet the increase in Olive Bush-Shrike calling was perceptible, and the reliability of their forecasting was frequently better than the weather forecasts broadcast on radio.</p><p>Olive Bush-Shrikes glean foliage and twigs to find small insects, spiders and other invertebrates. They also eat small fruits (such as of Ficus sp.) and they regularly join mixed-species foraging flocks. Although foraging is generally pursued in the mid-strata and canopy of mature forest habitats, these birds feed at lower levels in dense secondary forest, entering the fringe areas and occasionally extending their forays into adjacent non-forest habitats.</p><p>The breeding biology of this bush-shrike is not very well known, partly because their nests are well-concealed and usually sited three metres or more above ground level. Also, the birds are very wary during breeding activities.</p><p>The immature birds have a distinctive subadult plumage which lacks the characteristic patterns and some of the colours of the adults. It is not known how long this sub-adult plumage persists. Immature birds have been observed from July to December, and in April. Since most of the adults breed during the summer months the July to October sightings suggest that the young birds can retain their subadult plumage for several months. It is also noteworthy that a young Olive Bush-Shrike in subadult plumage cannot be confidently distinguished from a young Gorgeous Bush-Shrike, even in the hand!</p>",

These bright pectoral tufts are used, of course, in displays, especially during the breeding season when neighbouring territorial males form loose song groups (up to 20 strong) and dominant birds compete for the highest perches.</p><p>Like many forest-dwelling birds, Olive Sunbirds use voice as a primary means of communication and advertisement, and they have a variety of calls, as well as a lovely lilting song that is a characteristic sound of the dense dune and kloof forests of the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal and the Transkei region of the Eastern Cape.

One can seldom spend long in their favoured forest habitat without witnessing a spirited chase of one by another through the mid-strata. Population counts of five to seven birds/ha in coastal forest in KwaZulu-Natal provide a measure of their abundance in favoured habitat.</p><p>The most important nectar source for these sunbirds is the Coastal Strelitzia (Wild Banana) Strelitzia nicolai. This is a dominant tree in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal evergreen forest, much of which has been largely destroyed to make way for sugar cane plantations or for suburban houses. If enough shade trees are left standing in gardens, however, Olive Sunbirds are frequent, if unobtrusive visitors, taking nectar from ornamental plants such as fuchsias and poinsettias, and regularly utilising shallow birdbaths for bathing. As nectarivorous birds they seldom need to drink water except on very hot days, and like all members of the sunbird family and the sugarbirds, they are also insectivorous and are adept at finding and catching small insects by gleaning or by hawking them in flight, or stealing them from spiders’ webs (and eating the spiders too).</p><p>They often breed in forest-edge gardens, sometimes suspending their hanging nests under the eaves of buildings, or hanging them inside derelict huts, or (in years past) temporarily occupied buildings such as outside toilets! The seeming predilection for nesting close to human dwellings may be due to predator avoidance rather than shortage of nesting sites, since they can suspend their loosely clad nests (that look like hanging debris at first sight) from an unlimited supply of twigs in the forest, and indeed they often hang them above small streams. They have a comparatively high rate of breeding success with hatching and fledging rates of 100% and 91.7%, respectively, according to one study involving seven nests. The oldest ringed bird on record was 13 years and 4 months when last re-trapped.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Olive Thrushes are normally seen on the ground, often on a lawn, running or hopping about, then suddenly stopping and standing upright to listen. This listening stance is characteristic of many thrush species, including European relatives like the Blackbird Turdus merula, and is a habit adopted to detect one of their favourite food items – earthworms. Some gardeners object to the seeming plunder of ‘their’ earthworms by thrushes, but (as with most ‘harmful’ birds) there is a credit side to the thrushes’ foraging activities. They also eat snails (cracking their shells by beating them against an exposed woody root or stone), slugs, cutworms and a whole range of invertebrates that they find by turning over leaf litter. This is another favoured way of foraging; the thrush either vigorously whisking leaves aside or raking them backward with one foot.</p><p>Olive Thrushes are also very partial to fruit, and are frequently thought of as pests because of this predilection. Almost every thrush in town, for example, will visit a fruit-laden Mulberry tree. They usually prefer to pick up fallen fruits on the ground rather than plucking them. In addition to wild fruits they also eat fruits of ornamental shrubs such as Pyracanthaor Cotoneaster, but prefer special treats such as grapes and strawberries.</p><p>Olive Thrushes are also very partial to fruit, and are frequently thought of as pests because of this predilection.

In addition to wild fruits they also eat fruits of ornamental shrubs such as Pyracanthaor Cotoneaster, but prefer special treats such as grapes and strawberries.</p><p>In their natural habitat of evergreen forest, Olive Thrushes regularly bathe in the last 20 minutes of daylight, arriving in numbers at favourite bathing spots well screened by dense undergrowth. In dry areas where little or no surface water is normally available they resort to bathing in dew-laden foliage. But in a forest stream pool, or a sheltered garden birdbath, they go the whole hog and may get so thoroughly waterlogged that they can barely fly to the nearest low perch for an extended preening.</p><p>The attraction of town and city gardens to a normally rather shy forest bird is probably because gardens are usually well watered. Damp soil supports a more available invertebrate fauna, especially at times of the year when natural habitats are dry. The diversity of fruiting shrubs and trees in built-up areas may also provide a continuous cycle of ripe fruits. There is no doubt that thrushes are much easier to observe in their adopted habi&#173;tat, as they often become confiding garden birds; there are dangers too, and none more lethal than domestic cats, which annually take a heavy toll of garden-dwelling thrushes.</p><p>Recoveries of ringed thrushes show that they may live for 11 or 12 years. This seems conservative for an African bird of this size (averaging around 70 grams), and recaptures of ringed Olive Thrushes are almost four times less frequent than another common garden bird, the Cape Robin-Chat. In many parts of their range, suburban Olive Thrushes appear to be itinerant rather than resident. In other words, although there may be thrushes in the garden every day, those seen this week may not be the same as those seen last week. The rare recaptures of ringed birds have revealed some toing and froing, but despite this (or because of it) there are always thrushes present in prime habitat.</p><p>This is fortunate, for they are fine songsters, singing melodiously throughout the day in spring, and often starting their song before the dawn in periods of bright moonlight. Breeding pairs are resident, at least while they are building, laying, and attending nestlings and fledglings. A regularly filled birdbath placed under the cover of shrubberies will attract both adults and the spotted juveniles.</p>",

A different subspecies just extends its range into the eastern Zambezi Region where it occurs in riverine forests. In the southern and south-western Cape, Olive Woodpeckers share their forest habitat with Knysna Woodpeckers, but from the escarpment forests of KwaZulu-Natal to the Zoutpansberg it is usually the only forest-dwelling woodpecker.</p><p>Like most of their kind, Olive Woodpeckers are easily located by their calls or - when close enough – by their characteristic tapping when foraging or excavating a hole for a nest or for roosting. They have a distinctive contact call ‘wee-rit’, uttered three to five times (similar to the contact call of the Ground Woodpecker), and a less strident, chatty ‘chrayt-arayt-arayt’.</p><p>Like most of their kind, Olive Woodpeckers are easily located by their calls or - when close enough – by their characteristic tapping when foraging or excavating a hole for a nest or for roosting. They have a distinctive contact call ‘wee-rit’, uttered three to five times (similar to the contact call of the Ground Woodpecker), and a less strident, chatty ‘chrayt-arayt-arayt’.</p><p>Woodpeckers are among the most highly specialised birds when it comes to foraging. They tap wood with their beaks in order to locate a hollow area beneath the surface, hammering a hole through the wood to gain access to the hollow, then having to insert a very long, barbed tongue in order to impale and withdraw a wood-boring beetle larva. Woodpeckers can be broadly grouped into those with harpoon-type tongues that impale insect larvae, or those with sticky tongues that feed on ants: Olive Woodpeckers belong to the former group, while Knysna and Golden-tailed Woodpeckers belong to the latter.</p><p>Olive Woodpeckers are versatile foragers, however, for in addition to tapping dead wood, they also pry off loose bark, and probe moss and epiphytic plants. Adult weevils, bark beetles and spiders have been found in their stomachs, and they have even been seen hawking termite alates, as do dozens of other birds. They join mixed bird parties, probably benefiting from the enhanced predator early-warning function of such feeding associations, rather than from improved prey capture due to the ‘beating’ effect of numerous foraging individuals. They also vary their diet with plant products, swallowing the gummy sap of the Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo, and eating the ‘fruit’ (presumably the arillate seeds) of the African Peach Kiggelaria africana, another popular bird food.</p><p>Most populations are resident, but some undertake local movements to lower elevations in winter in KwaZulu-Natal. Many years ago I found a pair excavating a hole in a tree in forest near Yellowwood Park, Durban. The month was August, which was not unprecedented, but the locality (in warm coastal forest) was not typical for Olive Woodpeckers, which I had assumed to be altitudinal migrant visitors from inland. In the event, they did not breed in the hole and had left the forest a month later.</p><p>Olive Woodpeckers frequently enter gardens with adequate numbers of trees, and in the open grasslands of southern Drakensberg foothills they not only feed, but also breed, in the mature woodlots of long-established farmsteads. In July 2004 I heard a lot of Olive Woodpecker calls coming from an old woodlot of Eucalyptand Black Wattle trees, and eventually found their nest in the sawn-off end of a horizontal wattle branch. They were feeding well-developed chicks, so the female must have started her clutch in early June, an unusual and hitherto unrecorded month for breeding by this species. Such early breeding may be a way to thwart Scaly-throated Honeyguides, which often parasitise the nests of this woodpecker. &#9;</p>",

However, they tend to respond well to ‘spishing’. They frequently join mixed-species bird parties. When foraging, a bird usually starts at the base of a tree crown and gleans its way upward, examining twigs and leaves and flowers en route, sometimes making short flights to other positions within the tree crown. From the treetop the bird then glides down towards the base of the crown of a neighbouring tree, entering it with a last-second swerve, and working its way upwards again.</p><p>The Orange-breasted Bush-Shrike is sometimes encountered as a single bird, but pairs are more usual.

The female is less vocal, responding sometimes to male calls with husky, rasping notes. Pairs appear to remain in favoured spots for years and are evidently territorial, as pairs can be seen chasing one another and adopting horizontal threat postures with lateral body swaying and much beak clicking in hostile display toward their rivals. Information on territory size is lacking, however, and although this bush-shrike is widespread in Africa, comparatively little is known about other important aspects of its biology. The nest is built on a horizontal branch of a thorn tree, or in clustered growth of tree parasites such as Viscum or Loranthus, and the incubation (13-14 days) and nestling periods (12 days) have been docu&#173;mented, but detailed data on its breeding success, adult survival rates, or even on its diet, are scarce.</p><p>Another puzzling feature of the Orange-breasted Bush-Shrike is its striking resemblance in plumage colouration to the almost three-times-larger Grey-headed Bush-Shrike. The two species overlap throughout most of their extensive sub-Saharan ranges and show similar regional differences in plumage variation. It has been suggested that the Orange-breasted Bush-Shrike gains some protective advantage by looking like its larger relative (which is a predator of small vertebrates), but there is no direct evidence to support this assertion. Even the nest is very similar, although much smaller.</p>",

The male must rank as one of the most attractive members of the large sunbird family. He really is stunning with his metallic green head separated from his orange-coloured breast by a narrow violet band. His showy plumage, including yellow pectoral tufts exposed in display, habit of perching prominently and vociferous nature, make him hard to overlook. The female could be mistaken for a female of the co-occurring Southern Double-collared Sunbird, but she is pale yellow (not grey) below, and the calls are quite different.</p><p>Like many sunbird species, Orange-breasted Sunbirds undertake local movements and, during the winter months, there is often a large concentration at fairly low altitudes in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve on the False Bay coast of the Western Cape. By contrast, a summer visit to the same area may reveal no sunbirds at all; so where do they go? In the summer months the prevailing south-easterly trade winds bring moisture to the upper mountain slopes, which results in many Erica species flowering at that time. It is here that the Orange-breasted Sunbirds congregate, sometimes in flocks of 100 or more, to feed on the flowering ericas (for which they are an important pollinator). They also congregate in upland marshes, no doubt attracted by the midges that are associated with these damp areas, and also to the Fountain Bushes Psoralea pinnata which flower along the streams and seepages in summer. There is no evidence of long-distance movement (no ringed bird is known to have moved more than 4 km), but records of individuals in semi-arid country between the Anysberg and the Swartberg ranges in the eastern Little Karoo may indicate a tendency to local vagrancy.</p><p>Like many sunbird species, Orange-breasted Sunbirds undertake local movements and, during the winter months, there is often a large concentration at fairly low altitudes in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve on the False Bay coast of the Western Cape.

In the Helderberg Nature Reserve near Somerset West, they even tend to avoid the proteas and ericas that have been planted in the form of a garden, occurring regularly only in the natural veld on the mountain slopes.</p><p>Breeding has been reported throughout the year but there is a decided peak during the winter months when the weather is cold and wet and howling north-westerly winds are common. Ringing has established that they are double- and even treble-brooded. The nests, usually less than 1,5 m above the ground, are round with a top side entrance and are thickly lined with down, providing warmth in even the most inclement conditions. Unfortunately for the sunbirds, mice find them ideal ready-made homes and many nests are taken over. A small proportion of nests are placed in trees and one nest, on the slopes of the Helderberg above Somerset West, was built four metres from the ground in a Cluster Pine Pinus pinaster.</p><p>Their songs and contact calls are among the most characteristic sounds of the Western Cape mountains. During the breeding season, males sit for long periods singing their high-pitched songs with brief interruptions to chase intruders from their territories. The male also has a restrained subsong, which he sings for long periods from a hidden perch.</p><p>Sadly, Orange-breasted Sunbird numbers have declined dramatically over the last few decades, presumably because of the extensive burning (deliberate and unintentional) which has taken place over vast tracts of the Western Cape mountains. Following extensive fires on the Cape Peninsula, Orange-breasted Sunbirds are driven into suburbia – far from optimal habitat.</p>",

Pairs in the vicinity of the nest repeat a loud metallic ‘chink’ alarm note, while non-breeding birds often gather in reed beds during the midday hours to drink and rest, with much calling.</p><p>It feeds mostly on the ground on fallen dry grass seeds which are most abundant in late summer-autumn, and its breeding activity peaks at this time. There are so many empty, durable, woven nests of bishops, widows, weavers and prinias scattered through their habitat in these months that it is not surprising that these waxbills have developed the habit of taking them over for their own use. Nests of the Southern Red Bishop are especially favoured, and adopted ones are readily identified by the lining of grass seedheads and feathers the male waxbill adds and which protrude from the original entrance. The breeding season extends into winter, so this lining has to be substantial and warm. However, the waxbills have not lost the ability to build their own nests and one may occasionally find a ball of dry grass, leaves and seedheads assembled by the male about 50 cm up in matted grass or in a small bush in open grassland. These seem to appear mostly later in the breeding season, when suitable vacant nests of ‘host’ species (which are also adopted by the Grey Climbing Mouse Dendromus melanotis) could be in short supply.</p><p>It feeds mostly on the ground on fallen dry grass seeds which are most abundant in late summer-autumn, and its breeding activity peaks at this time.

This results in disparity in chick size which increases with age, the older chicks being more vigorous in their begging for food. I once reared a ‘brood’ of eight nestlings rescued from two nests unknowingly cut down when a patch of Hyppharenia grassland was mown. They were about half-grown, but the one brood was about three days older than the other. Each chick was fed in turn and then put back with the others, and on a few occasions I noticed an older chick which I had fed respond to the begging of one of the smaller ones by feeding it! Perhaps a replete older nestling in a nest may sometimes similarly feed a hungrily begging younger sibling?</p><p>The nestlings need more protein than that provided by dry grass seeds and at least some of this is obtained from insects, including African Large-headed Ants Pheidole megacephala which the adults undoubtedly collect when foraging on the ground, and which can be seen among the ingested seeds visible through the walls of the bulging crops of unfeathered chicks. The diet of captive birds was supplemented with these ants and which also stimulated the adults to ‘ant’ – this was done by a bird picking up an ant in the bill and wiping this along the flanks and under the wings, presumably to make use of a chemical secretion and to assist in feather maintenance.</p><p>The Orange-breasted Waxbill was previously placed in the genus Amandava, together with two Asian avadavat species. Goodwin, in an account of the Orange-breasted Waxbill and the Red Avadavat A. amandava in captivity, described both of them as ‘indefatigable anters’, and because of this and other similarities, retained the three species in that genus.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a bird of the remnant, evergreen forests of mist-belt regions, favouring narrow strips of forest along streams in escarpment ravines. As such, it is essentially a bird of the inland forests, most frequently encountered at altitudes of 1&#160;000 to 1&#160;500 metres, but ranging from 700 metres in the Eastern Cape to 1&#160;700 metres in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe and on Mount Gorongosa in Mozambique.</p><p>In its preferred habitat it is a fairly common bird (four breeding pairs per 4.5 ha in some Mpumalanga forests), but, when not singing, it is not always easy to find because its contact call is soft and seldom used. For much of the time, the only sound that may draw attention to its presence on the forest floor is the scuffling of its foraging activity in leaf litter. Even then it can be difficult to spot because its orange flanks and underparts blend well with the leaf carpet, and the double white wing bar and facial markings combine to form a subtly disruptive plumage pattern. Observer approach, however, will usually cause the bird to fly up to a perch (often a bare branch) about 1.5 metres above the ground, making it considerably easier to see.</p><p>In its preferred habitat it is a fairly common bird (four breeding pairs per 4.5 ha in some Mpumalanga forests), but, when not singing, it is not always easy to find because its contact call is soft and seldom used.

Observer approach, however, will usually cause the bird to fly up to a perch (often a bare branch) about 1.5 metres above the ground, making it considerably easier to see.</p><p>Another way to spot it is to pinpoint a singing bird; the males sing virtually throughout the year, especially in the early morning, and on and off throughout the day in spring, but only in a desultory way in March when undergoing the post-breeding moult. The song is a melodic series of whistled phrases, higher pitched than the song of the Olive Thrush, but to human ears confusingly similar to that of the forest-dwelling Brown Scrub-Robin, alongside which it often occurs. Singing birds usually perch in the treetops, and after chilly nights in early spring they are apt to seek the highest bare twigs to catch the first rays of the rising sun. Even so, pinpointing the songster is often more easily said than done.</p><p>Breeding pairs tend to be sedentary unless unusually dry conditions force them from their territories. Ringed territorial birds have demonstrated annual survival rates of almost 86%, which translates to an average lifespan of about 6.5 years. This means that young birds may have to wait for some years before finding a vacant territory and/or a mate. Movements of solitary birds, usually to somewhat lower altitudes, are commonplace in the dry season and probably involve these unmated individuals.</p><p>Like other ground-foraging forest birds, these ground-thrushes are quick to exploit the ‘beating’ activities of working mole rats, and an individual may spend all the daylight hours snapping up invertebrates disturbed by the intermittent upheavals of the leaf litter caused by these rodents.</p><p>Moist surface soil is essential for these birds because earthworms form a major portion of their diet and are the only food fed to nestlings (and probably also to young birds still under parental care). Many of the mist-belt forest patches in which Orange Ground-Thrushes breed are now surrounded by timber plantations, water-thirsty alien monocultures which lower the local water table and may seasonally dry up previously permanent streams. Such plantations thus pose a serious threat to the long-term persistence of these birds.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Orange River Francolin is smallish, with the sexes very similar in plumage colouration. They have a white throat, and the characteristic black necklace is thinner and more distinct than those of Shelley’s and Red-winged Francolins. They have a narrow black-and-white band behind the eye which runs down the side of the neck but does not meet on the throat.</p><p>Orange River Francolin is the western, arid-region replacement of Shelley’s and Grey-winged Francolins. In southern Africa, they occur in north-eastern and central Namibia, south-central Botswana, the North West Province, Gauteng, the Mpumalanga highveld, the Free State and the eastern Northern Cape. They prefer flat, sandy grasslands in the east, and wooded grasslands in hilly terrain in Namibia. They are most common in the sweet grasslands of the western savannas and the central Kalahari. Although typically a grassland species, they prefer patches of fairly dense cover, and often frequent the edges of cultivated lands.</p><p>Orange River Francolin is the western, arid-region replacement of Shelley’s and Grey-winged Francolins.

They prefer flat, sandy grasslands in the east, and wooded grasslands in hilly terrain in Namibia. They are most common in the sweet grasslands of the western savannas and the central Kalahari. Although typically a grassland species, they prefer patches of fairly dense cover, and often frequent the edges of cultivated lands.</p><p>This locally common, resident francolin is usually seen in pairs or small coveys of 3-5 birds. When approached, they sit tight, like many of the grassland francolins, and then scurry away into dense cover. When a bird is flushed, it will gain considerable height before veering off over trees. Like most francolins, they enjoy a regular midday dust bath. Roosting sites are invariably in patches of flat, open ground and they are seldom used for more than two consecutive nights.</p><p>The advertisement call, ‘kibitele, kibitele’, is similar to that of the Shelley’s Francolin, but is far more rapid with less deliberate spacing between the notes. Calling birds often perch on a conspicuous object such as a rock and call intensely with their beaks pointing skywards. Most calling is in the early morning and evening, and more so during the breeding season. Territorial individuals can be attracted with a playback of the advertisement call, and one can get a fair estimate of the number of coveys in an area by counting the number of calling birds early in the morning. Other subdued, grating calls are used either to communicate between individuals in a covey at close quarters or to indicate alarm at the approach of a predator.</p><p>Their diet and feeding behaviour are similar to those of other grassland francolins. In winter, their diet includes corms, bulbs, seeds and some green shoots. In summer, insects such as leaf bugs, beetles, ants, termites and grasshoppers feature more prominently.</p><p>They are monogamous, solitary nesters. Although breeding can occur at any time of the year, peak breeding is during winter in northern Namibia and northern Botswana, autumn in central Namibia and south-eastern Botswana, and early summer in South Africa. However, because of their preference for drier grasslands, their breeding season varies depending on rainfall patterns. The nest is a scrape in the ground, usually in dense grass, and is lined with dry grass. They sometimes create a canopy by pulling nearby vegetation over the nest. The clutch of 5-8 eggs is incubated by the female only for 20-21 days. Chicks can flutter-fly at 12-14 days, and are accomplished flyers at 5-6 weeks.</p><p>Like Red-winged and Shelley’s Francolins, Orange River Francolins are susceptible to poorly managed grazing which results in degraded grasslands. They were previously abundant throughout the Northern Cape, but since the 1930s they have all but disappeared west of 22° E. Possible reasons for this are increased stock levels with resultant overgrazing, and a progressive decrease in rainfall.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Accipiters are not easy birds to get to grips with, partly because of their unobtrusive nature and partly because of the similarities between several of the species. The Ovambo Sparrowhawk is probably the least easy of the group to get to know because not only is it unobtrusive and similar-looking to other commoner species, but it is uncommon as well, and so is only infrequently encountered. Such encounters may be of a high-flying bird, alternately flapping and gliding as it skims out of view over the trees, or as it slips off a high branch where it has been perched and vanishes through the branches, leaving one guessing whether it had a white rump or not, or whether the tail had broad or narrow bars.</p><p>Ovambo Sparrowhawks are long-tailed, rather slender hawks with long yellow or orange legs and long, deadly toes. Females are a third larger than males and they prey almost entirely on birds, the smaller males catching mostly warbler- to weaver-sized birds, and the larger females preying more frequently on dove-sized prey. Once one is familiar with the bird, its small, rather ‘beaky’-looking head is a good identification feature, but seeing an Ovambo for the first time requires some attention to other details. In particular it is the pattern of the upper sides of the tail that is the most diagnostic, and if this can be checked and compared with the tail patterns in the Shikra, Little Sparrowhawk and African Goshawk, identification can be confirmed. Other supporting evidence is eye colour (wine red in Ovambo), absence of a white rump, and chest barring extending to the base of the bill.</p><p>Ovambo Sparrowhawks are long-tailed, rather slender hawks with long yellow or orange legs and long, deadly toes.

In both cases, the most obvious identification feature is a dark area behind the eye, topped by a conspicuous white eyebrow that widens towards the back of the head. Ovambo Sparrowhawks may breed while still in this non-adult plumage, presenting the odd spectacle of a grey adult paired with a brown immature and later in the cycle, of the immature bird feeding its similar-looking young.</p><p>Almost throughout its range across the savanna belt of sub-Saharan Africa the Ovambo Sparrowhawk is considered to be uncommon or rare. The exception is in South Africa’s Gauteng Province, the most developed, industrialised, polluted and populated part of the country, with the burgeoning cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria in its midst. Here, it has been discovered, Ovambo Sparrowhawks live in many of the mature copses of tall poplars, pines, eucalypts and other alien trees, that occur in the more open country beyond the city limits. Although they are secretive birds, a careful search through such plantations will often reveal the bird’s presence.</p><p>Ovambo Sparrowhawks breed in the first half of summer and start repairing an old nest or, more often, building a new one in late August. Both sexes do this, and the completed nest is substantially larger than those of the Shikra and Little Sparrowhawk. From before egg-laying, which happens in September or October, to when the nestlings begin to feather, the female remains at or close to the nest, and during this time she is fed by the male. One often finds shed flight feathers lying on the ground in the vicinity of the nest tree during this period, showing that she takes the opportunity while inactive to replace her flight feathers. The male brings her, on average, three meals a day,  increasing this to about seven prey items per day once the chicks hatch. As the young develop and the food demand increases, so the female leaves the brood unattended for increasingly long spells as she assists the male in provisioning the growing family.</p>",

These starlings often forage together, aggregating at fruiting trees with weavers and sparrows. Fruits of Wild Date Palm Phoenix reclinata, wild figs (Ficus spp.), Bluebush or Jakkalsbessie Diospyros lycioides and Cabbage Tree Cussonia spicata, berries of karee trees (Rhus), Rockwood Heeria insignis and the tiny tomato-like fruits of honey-thorns (Lycium sp.) are important in the diet, but the birds also eat insects. Fruits of invasive alien plants, including Ivy Hedera helix, Persian Lilac Melia azedrach and Cotoneaster Cotoneaster salicifolia are eaten (and the seeds probably efficiently dispersed). Pollen and nectar from aloes are opportunistically eaten, often staining the birds’ foreheads yellow. An analysis of stomach contents showed that the birds had eaten fruits or seeds of Shepherds-tree Boscia albitrunca, Cotoneaster, dry seeds of Rattle-pod Crotalaria steudneri, small Wild Olive fruits Olea europaeaafricana, Karee Rhus lancea and Buffalo Thorn Ziziphus mucronata, grasshoppers and beetles. Insects are caught on the ground or gleaned from vegetation. Termite alates and butterflies are hawked from a perch, and ectoparasites are gleaned from ungulates, including Klipspringers Oreotragus oreotragus and Mountain Zebras Equus zebra.</p><p>Pale-winged Starlings are near-endemic to southern Africa. Their distribution range is from about Sumbe in Angola, south through Namibia and most of the Karoo as far east as south-western edge of the Free State. Their tolerance towards the transformation of their habitat is uncertain – the birds occur on rocky hills and cliffs where they roost and breed, and enter towns and villages, but there are few records of the species nesting on man-made structures. Their rocky hill habitat is generally unsuitable for agriculture so breeding and roosting sites are probably not threatened, but much of their food is found in drainage-line woodlands away from the hills, and these areas are susceptible to modification by man. Pale-winged Starlings are, however, well represented in protected areas.

For this reason the breeding biology of the species is not well known. Pale-winged Starlings nested once in the loft of a farmhouse at Tierberg, Prince Albert, but were displaced by Red-winged Starlings, who took over the nest. Pale-winged Starling pairs defend a territory in the immediate vicinity of the nest, but they are semi-colonial nesters, sharing the nest-site cliff with other nesting pairs. The nest is built of sticks and dry grass, with a cup lined with finer grass, and both sexes help to build. Unlike Red-winged Starling nests, mud is not used in the basic nest structure. The clutch is usually of three pale greenish eggs, smudged and spotted with reddish-brown. Incubation is by the female only. The male accompanies the female when she leaves the nest to forage; otherwise he perches near the nest and sings. Nestlings are fed by both parents for about 25 days in the nest. Pale-winged Starlings are parasitised by Great Spotted Cuckoos in some areas.</p>",

It is a handsome bird, its pearl-grey colouring offset by red legs and cere, and it perches obligingly on tree- and bush tops and, wherever they are present, on roadside telephone poles. Mostly, single birds are seen in this way, although the chances are high that a mate is similarly perched somewhere in the area – once adult, these birds are essentially sedentary, paired year-round and settled in permanent territories. Ringing has provided a few surprises, though, in which adult birds have relocated over distances of hundreds of kilometres from where they were caught, so one can’t be too dogmatic about their sedentary nature.</p><p>A population of Pale Chanting Goshawks in the Little Karoo has been the subject of a detailed study, and here pairs live year-round in territories averaging 5-6 square kilometres in size. They specialise here in hunting diurnal rodents, especially two desert-living species, the Bush Karoo Rat and Brant’s Whistling Rat, and they hunt their prey almost entirely from high perches, swooping down for the kill and, if necessary, pursuing the prey on foot into the shrubbery. Territories vary in quality according to rodent densities and availability of hunting perches. Rodent densities, in turn, are determined by the nature of the ground cover and the presence or absence of raised ground locally known as ‘heuweltjies’, these being the favoured haunts of such rodents.</p><p>A population of Pale Chanting Goshawks in the Little Karoo has been the subject of a detailed study, and here pairs live year-round in territories averaging 5-6 square kilometres in size.

In soaring flight the black primary feathers provide a broad terminal edge to otherwise all-white underwings and, as one would expect, most soaring occurs in the heat of the day when rising air provides lift. The ‘chant’ that gives the bird its name is one of the characteristic sounds of the Karoo and Kalahari. It is mostly uttered at dawn, with both sexes calling repeatedly then, a melodious series of whistled notes that accelerate towards the end, always bringing to my mind the sound of a spinning plate as it comes to settle – ‘kleeeu-kleeu-kle-klu-kluklu-klukluklu’…</p><p>About one in five nesting pairs include a third bird, invariably a male, to form a nesting trio rather than a pair. Although subordinate to the alpha male, the extra male is not only tolerated but also participates in all activities associated with the nesting cycle, even mating with the female. Such partnerships are referred to as ‘co-operative polyandry’. The trios were found to occupy the best territories in the district in terms of prey availability and they were more productive than other nesting pairs, producing more young per annum.</p><p>Breeding occurs between July and December, most clutches being laid in August and September in South Africa and a month later in Namibia. Previously-used nests often get refurbished for a second nesting attempt but it is more usual for a new nest to be built each year. Nests are most commonly placed in the upper branches of an acacia or some other thorny tree, as a rule within five metres of the ground. In the absence of trees the birds may nest in a low shrub or in the crossbars of a telephone pole. In ‘good’ conditions some pairs may breed twice in a year whereas in years when prey is scarce no breeding may occur at all.</p>",

They are very easily overlooked unless you are watching out for them because they are not noisy and they sit very quietly on a perch from which they either pounce on prey below or hawk insects flying nearby. They also spend a lot of time on the ground, hopping around looking for insect prey rather than watching from a perch.</p><p>This rather drab flycatcher is closely related to the Marico Flycatcher, but the Pale Flycatcher is a bird of the broad-leaved woodlands while the Marico Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the acacia or thin-leaved woodlands. They do occasionally occur side by side but usually they are separated by habitat. In regions where the Marico Flycatcher is absent, as in the bushveld of Mpumalanga, Swaziland and the Zululand game reserves, Pale Flycatchers are commonly encountered in Acacia woodland. This bird has relatively little contrast between the brownish back and the light brown chest and belly. The Marico Flycatcher has a marked contrast between the brown back and a clean white breast and belly. The juvenile is somewhat streaked below, but otherwise looks very like the adult.</p><p>This rather drab flycatcher is closely related to the Marico Flycatcher, but the Pale Flycatcher is a bird of the broad-leaved woodlands while the Marico Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the acacia or thin-leaved woodlands.

The Marico Flycatcher has a marked contrast between the brown back and a clean white breast and belly. The juvenile is somewhat streaked below, but otherwise looks very like the adult.</p><p>The birds are usually found in pairs and would appear to be territorial throughout the year. It is noticeable that in midsummer you will find small groups of Pale Flycatchers, usually consisting of a pair of adults and two or three juveniles. I found that these birds usually joined bird parties as they went through their territory, but did not remain with the bird party once it left the flycatchers’ territory. Nevertheless, because there are always birds that do not hold territory in the woodlands, these ‘floaters’ would join the bird party and remain with the bird party throughout the day.</p><p>The Pale Flycatcher is usually quiet through most of the year, but in spring when the birds are nesting the male does a lot of calling to advertise his territory. It has been recorded that he sings to the female while she is gathering nest material and building the nest. The song is described as a warbling song with a jumble of various notes like ‘treeky-treeky, trip-treeky, chip chippy-chee’ and other similar variants.</p><p>I was able to watch this species in a particular patch of woodland near Marondera, and we ringed some of the birds in the area. One ringed Pale Flycatcher returned to exactly the same tree to nest in three consecutive years. Whether the mate was different, we could not tell because we were unable to trap the mate to put a ring on its leg.</p><p>The birds build a fairly substantial cup-shaped nest made from various grades of plant material, with the coarser material on the outside and gradually getting finer and finer as you got into the middle. The nest was lined with very fine grass rootlets. The presumed female would sit incubating the eggs and would be fed by the presumed male on the nest. Later when the eggs hatched the female would pass food to the small chicks but kept them covered for the rest of the time. Once the chicks started developing feathers and were able to be left uncovered, both birds would bring food to the chicks, often in very quick succession. The chicks were eventually so large that they tended to overflow the nest, and one of them moved up into the tree above the nest where the adults continued to feed it. Subsequently we saw the ringed bird with two juveniles in the same general area as the nest.&#9;</p>",

One of the suggested causes is that, in Eurasia, the Pallid Harrier specialises in hunting voles and because the numbers of these fluctuate widely between years, these harriers pay the price of specialisation by having a very variable breeding success. By contrast, the Montagu’s Harrier is a generalised predator, and its broader prey base enables it to breed with the same success each year.</p><p>Small numbers of Pallid Harriers come to southern Africa each year, the first arrivals reaching here in September, but most coming two months later, and by mid-March most have departed again.

The adults have a black-and-white plumage with a large, heavy bill and bare red skin on the cheek and around the eye. The juveniles are brown in colour and have a black, not yellow bill, but they do have the bright yellow legs and feet of the adults. This vulture is normally associated with groves of Raphia Palms Raphia australis which grow principally in the Equatorial forests, especially near rivers. Along the Congo River Estuary in the DRC, for example, Palm-nut Vultures are abundant and are the most commonly seen large birds.</p><p>Raphia Palm groves occur naturally in places along the coast of Mozambique and in the swamp forests around the Kosi Lakes at the north-eastern tip of KwaZulu-Natal. This palm has also become naturalised further down the Zululand coast at Mtunzini, where it was first planted over 100 years ago. It is interesting that in Zimbabwe there are a number of places where Raphia Palms have grown and to which the Palm-Nut Vultures come regularly to see whether any of the palms have ripe fruit. The best known of these places is near the golf course in the Hondi Valley, and the vultures visit it almost on a monthly basis. At some of the quite extensive Raphia plots in various places in southern Africa, Palm-nut Vultures have become breeding residents. In the late 1980s it was estimated that there were only three to six breeding pairs and now there are known to be over 12 pairs breeding in our region.</p><p>Raphia Palm groves occur naturally in places along the coast of Mozambique and in the swamp forests around the Kosi Lakes at the north-eastern tip of KwaZulu-Natal.

They are also known to feed on road-kill carrion. For their basic food supply, however, they depend on the fruit of the Raphia Palm. These fruits take two years to develop, are covered with overlapping scales, and are 90 mm long when ripe. The Palm-nut Vulture breaks one off and carries it to a perch. There it holds the fruit in its talons and flicks off the scales to expose a sweet layer of orange-coloured flesh covering the seed. This is scraped off with the sharp bill, and the bare seed is dropped to the ground. No doubt many of these seeds subsequently grow, thereby extending the palm grove.</p><p>The nest of the Palm-nut Vulture is a large platform of sticks, some of which are up to a metre long. The middle of the platform is basin-shaped and lined with dry grass, dung and other finer material. It is always placed in the upper fronds of a Raphia Palm, usually at 18 to 20 metres above the ground. One egg is laid in August or September, and the single chick is fed animal food for the first two months and thereafter the amount of palm fruit flesh is gradually increased. The chicks fledge at about 90 days, and apparently are immediately able to pick fruit from the palm tree and peel it. In our region these young birds appear to disperse southwards and westwards after becoming independent, and they turn up in various unlikely places. There are records of immature birds across much of southern Africa, especially the southern Cape. We see them quite regularly in the southern Cape where they are often mistaken for juveniles of the much larger Fish Eagle. Breeding birds appear to maintain territory throughout the year, only moving a short distance away in search of food.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In most parts of southern Africa, the Parasitic Jaeger, or Arctic Skua as it is often still known, is the commonest of the three small skuas or jaegers, all of which are non-breeding visitors from the boreal tundra, spending the northern winter in the Southern Hemisphere. In breeding plumage, adults of the three species are quite distinctive, but their identification on the wintering grounds is complicated by a series of seasonal and age-related plumage differences as well as pale, dark and intermediate colour morphs. Unless you obtain a really good view, which is seldom the case from a rocking boat at sea, their identification often relies heavily on ‘jizz’. The Parasitic Jaeger is the middle of the three species in terms of size, intermediate between the more bulky, barrel-chested Pomarine Jaeger, and the delicate, tern-like Long-tailed Jaeger. But this is only a general guideline; there is some individual variation, not least between the sexes, with females appreciably larger than males.</p><p>Parasitic Jaegers are most often seen harrying terns or small gulls in flight. They seem to obtain almost all of their food in this manner, although small numbers sometimes gather at trawlers to scavenge scraps, and they have been observed killing storm petrels feeding behind a trawler. In general, the Parasitic Jaeger’s distribution reflects that of its victims; it is most common along the west and south coasts, and seldom ventures too far offshore. Between harrying other birds, the jaegers spend a lot of time on the water, superficially recalling small, dark petrels but typically sitting higher in the water. Once they spot an intended victim, they pursue it swiftly with deep, powerful, almost falcon-like wingbeats, and display impressive aerial combat skills to stay with their target. Several other jaegers frequently join the chase, and it is often the jaeger that hangs back who benefits, grabbing the regurgitated prey in the air before the other birds pursuing the victim more closely can react.</p><p>Parasitic Jaegers are most often seen harrying terns or small gulls in flight.

They are scarce off the east coast, although a few birds might travel north through the Red Sea, and there are some records from the Rift Valley in East Africa. Despite this, it is extremely rare inland in southern Africa, with only a few records of birds carried into the Kruger Park by tropical cyclones. Although they mostly roost at sea, occasional birds come ashore, often at tern roosts, and this behaviour is most common along Namibia’s Skeleton Coast, where small flocks may be found roosting along the coast.</p><p>Many Parasitic Jaegers in Europe breed in association with seabird colonies, stealing food from other birds. In recent years they have suffered along with their victims as stocks of small fish such as sand eels have largely disappeared. However, the jaegers are not threatened, because in much of their range they breed in the tundra where they eat a wide range of prey, including small mammals and birds. In these areas they do well in years of high lemming abundance. Lemming years reduce the jaeger hunting pressure on other tundra-breeding birds such as shorebirds, resulting in large numbers of juvenile migrant waders reaching southern Africa the following austral summer.</p>",

Further, it is never common and has a series of fairly discrete subpopu&#173;lations, with breeding concentrations in the Western and Eastern Cape, Limpopo Province, the Mashonaland highveld of Zimbabwe and the Khomas Hochland area of Namibia. It has benefited from man in some areas where we have created suitable low bridges, culverts and various types of buildings. These they may utilise for breeding, supplementing and expanding on the original restrictive breeding habitat on overhangs of small cliffs, in caves or in the burrows of mammals such as Antbear, Porcupine and Brown Hyena. This adaptation to new types of habitat appears to be more prevalent in the south, and northern records of utilisation of man-made structures are limited. Where birds have not adapted to man-made structures they may have declined locally due to the destruction for agriculture of suitable woodlands and the loss of larger burrowing mammals on which they are dependent, as is the case in Zimbabwe.</p><p>The movements of this bird are rather complex and ill-understood. The only truly migratory population is that of the southern regions of the two Cape provinces, these birds moving northwards for the winter. The southern birds leave in March and return from late August, with overwintering being very rare. The destination of these migrants is not known, as they may visit areas with resident or nomadic populations and presumably mix with them. For instance, in Limpopo Province this swallow is essentially resident with little indication of seasonal fluctuations. In winter it is more widely reported and it has been suggested in the past that the area does play host to migrants, although there is the possibility that they may occur there more frequently only at migration time.</p><p>The movements of this bird are rather complex and ill-understood.

Ringing studies there show that longer-winged birds do visit in the winter and, because they occur at localities where no resident birds are found, it is assumed that these are visitors from further south. The bird is only a sparse non-breeding visitor to Botswana from April to November, mainly to the Okavango Swamps, but there is no indication as to whether these birds are from the Cape region or wanderers/migrants from Namibia. The former is the more likely as numbers are greatest during the migration periods in April to May and October.</p><p>There is still uncertainty about the bird’s status in Namibia, where it is quite sparse, but the impression gained is that the southern birds from the highland area are migrants arriving September and departing March/April, with northern birds remaining resident. In Zambia the breeding birds are resident, but flocks occur on the Kafue Flats and the floodplains of the upper Zambezi during winter and are probably migrants from the south. Thus, taking into account that Botswana records are for winter and spring, flocks occur in southern Zambia in winter while the breeding birds further north and east are sedentary, and that numbers increase in Zimbabwe during winter, it is logical to assume that these three northern territories do indeed play host to visitors from the Cape provinces.</p><p>These swallows build a half-cup of mud pellets on a vertical face of a cliff, a bank along a river, in an animal burrow or on man-made structures.

        "Body_Content": "<p>‘An owl with attitude’ would probably be the most appropriate way of summing up the Pearl-spotted Owlet in a few words. It is a small chunky-looking species, highly vocal, ever alert, and feared by all the smaller birds that co-exist with it in the African savannas. It is more diurnal in its habits than other owls in the region, not given to retreating into a dark thicket during the day, or adopting the sleepy daytime look of other owls. Instead it fixes one with a penetrating stare whenever it is encountered, switching its long expressive tail from side to side if agitated, or jerkily swivelling its head as if to check for potential threats to left and right. It has the unusual ability to rotate its head through 180 degrees, so can glare at you over one shoulder, then rotate and glare at you over the other. It also has two distinctive black patches on the nape, often referred to as ‘false eyes’, and when its head faces away; these seemingly real eyes maintain the glare.</p><p>Pearl-spotted Owlets are one of the commonest savanna owls. They are sedentary, and in suitable habitat pairs maintain year-round territories about 50-100 hectares in size. Territoriality is largely expressed through vocalisations, and these owls are more vocal than most, uttering their piercing, far-carrying whistled notes throughout the year, and as often during the day as at night. At times at the onset of the breeding season pairs call in duet, the male uttering his rising crescendo of notes, with the female joining in as his call fades with her higher-pitched crescendo. It is an unmistakable sound and unlikely to go unnoticed. The call is also easily imitated, and doing this is an effective way of attracting not only the resident owls, but also an assortment of bushveld passerines coming to mob the perceived predator.</p><p>Pearl-spotted Owlets are one of the commonest savanna owls.

Drongos have even mastered the skill of imitating this owl to perfection, and their mimicked whistling draws other birds in to the fray. If the owl takes to flight, the chatter of the mobbing birds increases by an octave or two, and the owl’s withdrawal, appearing, in flight, rather woodpecker-like, is accompanied by an entourage of frenzied birds.</p><p>Birds do feature in the Pearl-spotted Owlet’s diet, with species such as White-throated Robin-Chat, Grey-backed Camaroptera, Scaly-feathered Finch and Red-faced Mousebird on record as being taken. I have also watched one take a fully grown Laughing Dove chick from its nest and fly with difficulty while carrying the struggling dove across the lawn. But birds are secondary to what it preys on most frequently, which are arthropods, beetles, moths and other insects. Also taken are small rodents, lizards, frogs and even molluscs; in short, it is a much generalised predator, catching virtually anything it can overpower.</p><p>The breeding season is well defined throughout the region, with egg-laying peaking in early summer. Nest sites are invariably enclosed cavities in trees, and most are cavities originally excavated by the larger woodpeckers or barbets; many such holes are reused by the owls in successive summers. Three eggs form the normal clutch, and the female incubates these throughout the day and night without male assistance, leaving the nest only at infrequent intervals to defecate, groom and receive prey brought by her partner. The nesting cycle lasts for a little over two months before the next generation of these spirited little predators emerges from the nest to continue the family tradition.</p>",

Where once it was exciting to find a single bird, numbers have increased to the point where up to seven have been found together. The preponderance of records in the eastern half of the region, coupled with sightings from further north to Kenya, suggest that most now reach us from Siberia. It is unclear quite why they have become more common at a time when most migrant wader populations are in trouble. Pectoral Sandpipers usually are found at freshwater wetlands, especially among inundated short grass by pans and dams.

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Pel’s Fishing Owl is an owl to eclipse all other owls, striking in its appearance, unorthodox in its habits, and exhilarating to track down in its forested strongholds. It is a much localised bird in southern Africa but ranges widely across the forested parts of sub-Saharan Africa, meeting up with two other smaller Fishing Owl species in the Congo and West Africa. In size, it is on a par with Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl, standing about 60 cm tall when perched, and it has an overall warm ginger-buff colouring, with darker brown scalloped markings in front and barring behind. It has a rather slender head for the size of its body, and its ink-black, rather close-set eyes are fringed by a pale buff facial disc. A closer look at its feet reveals that the legs are unfeathered, that the claws are long, sharp and strongly curved, and that the soles of its feet are spiny, all adaptations for catching fish. Another unexpected feature in this unusual owl is that its flight feathers lack the soft edging found in other owls which give these birds their silent flight. Silent flight is clearly not a necessity when stalking underwater fish.</p><p>A variety of bird species from penguins to kingfishers live on fish and each has evolved the tools and techniques to catch these. Here is an owl that has done the same, but it catches them at night. In the day it requires deep shady trees in which to roost, hollows in large trees for breeding, and perches overlooking stretches of water from which it can fish. These requirements are best met along perennial rivers that are fringed by a gallery of tall evergreen trees, with low branches overhanging the water or emergent stumps providing fishing sites.</p><p>A variety of bird species from penguins to kingfishers live on fish and each has evolved the tools and techniques to catch these.

These requirements are best met along perennial rivers that are fringed by a gallery of tall evergreen trees, with low branches overhanging the water or emergent stumps providing fishing sites.</p><p>In southern Africa these conditions are best met in the Okavango Delta with its maze of forested channels, high fish densities and year-round water, and it is estimated that this one-and-a-half million hectare wetland supports about 100 breeding pairs. Other east-flowing rivers, including the Zambezi, Save, Limpopo, Levuvhu, Olifants, Sabie, Phongolo and Mkuze, have stretches of suitable habitat too, and also support small numbers of Pel’s Fishing Owls, but the bird’s continued survival on at least some of these rivers is tenuous in the extreme. The Olifants River, for example, runs dry in some years because of upstream water abstraction.</p><p>Pel’s Fishing Owls are nocturnal, only venturing out from their roosts at dusk to take up fishing positions, returning to the same sites regularly, usually a branch or stump standing a metre or two above the river. From these the water surface is scanned intently and when prey is sighted the bird swoops on it, eyes closed and feet outstretched, partly or completely submerging itself in the process. The prey is brought back to the perch to eat, sites that can sometimes be identified by the fish scales left on the branch. Barbel, bream, pike and squeakers are commonly caught prey, most weighing in the region of 100-250 grams.</p><p>As with other owls, it is when these birds call that their presence is most readily detected. They are most vocal at the start of the breeding season, between February and May, and the male’s deep, sonorous hoot is audible from more than a kilometre away, a booming ‘hoooommm-hut’. The female may join in with a higher-pitched hoot. She, and later in the year the fledged chick, also makes a plaintive wailing call signifying that it requires food, a sound that was marvellously described in Austin Roberts’s 1940 edition of Roberts Birds of South Africa as “a weird screechy howl, which rises in a nerve-shattering crescendo to peter out like a cry of a lost soul falling into a bottomless pit”.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Pennant-winged Nightjar is one of the world’s iconic night birds. Like other nightjars, they are cryptic and inconspicuous by day, but when in flight at night and during their graceful courtship displays, breeding males are spectacular and unmistakable. In full breeding dress, males are adorned with trailing white ‘pennants’ (elongated second primary feathers) that may reach up to 77 cm in length; these extend from unique, square-shaped wings with sharply demarcated white and black markings that present a striking image in the gloom of their woodland environment at dusk. The female Pennant-winged Nightjar is a much plainer bird, lacking the male’s pennants and black-and-white wing pattern. Indeed, she is unusual among nightjars in lacking pale spots in the wing and tail altogether.</p><p>The habitat of this nightjar is the vast belt of Miombo (Brachystegia) and other broad-leafed woodland that extends across much of tropical Africa south of the Equator, and extends into the north of our region. Zimbabwe is the stronghold of this nightjar in southern Africa, but this species also occurs in northern Botswana and Namibia as well as northern Limpopo Province. Although it breeds in these areas in summer, its stay is relatively brief, and by the end of February most Pennant-winged Nightjars have departed on their post-nuptial migration to wintering grounds north of the Equator.</p><p>The habitat of this nightjar is the vast belt of Miombo (Brachystegia) and other broad-leafed woodland that extends across much of tropical Africa south of the Equator, and extends into the north of our region.

Although it breeds in these areas in summer, its stay is relatively brief, and by the end of February most Pennant-winged Nightjars have departed on their post-nuptial migration to wintering grounds north of the Equator.</p><p>The remarkable life history of this nightjar was first described in 1916 by Chapin, whose study of the species showed it to be a trans-Equatorial migrant that breeds in southern Africa, and winters to the north and east of the Congo Basin. From February to August, non-breeding birds occur from Nigeria and Cameroon to western Kenya.  Many of these males have lost their pennants, which have broken off before or during migration. The pennants are replaced from May to June, and frequently are only half-grown when the pre-nuptial migration begins from August to September.</p><p>Pennant-winged Nightjars migrate in pairs or in single-sex flocks, with groups of up to 50 birds recorded travelling together in the daytime. They arrive on their breeding grounds from September in Zambia and northern Zimbabwe, to November in Limpopo Province at the southern limit of their range. Males arrive three weeks before females to establish and defend their display arenas, which are clearings in or on the edge of woodland. Once the females arrive, the pennanted males undertake their extraordinary and beautiful displays. Calling starts at the onset of darkness – a high-pitched, cricket-like piping ‘seep-seep-seep…’, given in flight or while perched. They repeatedly fly in circuits around their display arenas with slow wingbeats, often returning to the song perch.</p><p>Unusually, these nightjars are polygamous. Males mate with several females and play no part in incubation or care of the young; this is the exclusive role of the females. Two pinkish-salmon eggs are laid on light leaf litter or on burnt ground. The young are extremely cryptic, blending in well with the charred background and burnt stubble.</p><p>Pennant-winged Nightjars feed on small airborne insects: beetles, moths, termites, bugs and small cicadas make up the bulk of the diet. Compared with other Afrotropical nightjars, their gapes are relatively small, and larger beetles and other insects do not usually feature in their diet.</p><p>Sadly, reports from several parts of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique indicate that Pennant-winged Nightjars are declining in southern Africa. Where males in full breeding dress were a common sight at night, few are now seen. Even in areas without traffic, this nightjar has now disappeared. Reasons for their decline probably include habitat destruction (clearing of woodland and charcoal burning) in their breeding and non-breeding ranges, as well as road casualties, which affect males in particular.</p>",

        "Breeding": "July to December.",
        "Body_Content": "<p>The Peregrine Falcon is one of the most comprehensively studied and best known birds on the planet. This is partly because it is so widely distributed (found on every continent and major land mass except New Zealand and Antarctica), and partly because of the intensive conservation attention it received in the latter half of the twentieth century, after populations in Europe and the US were decimated by the advent of persistent pesticides like DDT. It is also a species with charisma to burn, and many of the thousands of Peregrine students and fanatics around the world are simply drawn by the bird’s irresistible energy and attitude, by its perfection of form, and by its incredible powers of flight.</p><p>The Peregrine is arguably the ultimate bird-hunting raptor. Key build specifications – massive pectoral muscles, sharp wings, stiff, smoothly contoured plumage and large, long-toed feet – all combine to produce a flying machine optimally designed to generate and control extreme velocity in near-vertical dives or stoops, and to catch and carry fast-moving prey in open airspace. Like all predators, Peregrines depend heavily on surprise to hunt successfully, and have opted to achieve it not by stealth, but by means of a very rapid approach. How fast can they go? This all depends on prevailing conditions, the intended quarry, and the height advantage available to the hunting falcon, but in strikes made over 2-3 km, from over 1 000 m up, they probably achieve speeds well in excess of 400 km/h. The levels of fine control achieved in hunts at such high speeds are sublime, and the G-forces exerted on the falcon’s body by the required rapid and adroit changes of velocity and direction are phenomenal.</p><p>The Peregrine is arguably the ultimate bird-hunting raptor.

They also take both insectivorous and fruit-eating bats. Perhaps because they often hunt over closed canopy woodland, forest or Fynbos, they typically ‘catch-and-carry’ their prey, grabbing and subduing it in mid-air, rather than delivering a glancing blow and risking losing it in the vegetation below. To do this, they often drop into the stoop well behind their intended target, flattening out as they approach into the rear blind-spot of its peripheral vision, and grabbing or binding to it with their oversized feet in an upward surge at contact.</p><p>Peregrines are obsessed with occupying the highest ground in their surroundings. Under pristine conditions, breeding pairs favour terrain with plenty of sheer, towering cliffs – big escarpments, prominent inselbergs, rocky peninsulas and incised river gorges. They are assertive and loudly vocal birds, and tend to dominate their home cliffs. They breed in spring, laying up to four eggs on a flattish, sheltered ledge, and raise up to four very noisy young. While they are susceptible to modern chemical pollution of their food chains, and they are extremely prone to colliding with the many aerial hazards that accompany human development (in particular overhead power and telephone lines), they have successfully colonised many of the world’s big cities, where skyscrapers substitute for cliffs, and where teeming flocks of columbids and starlings provide a super-abundance of easily caught food. In fact, the rapid proliferation of Peregrines over the last 10-15 years in sprawling metropolises like London and New York, and locally in Cape Town, suggests that urban landscapes may now be optimal habitat for this supreme aerial predator.</p>",

In the past breeding only took place on the natural saline pans of the interior in years when there was sufficient water, and as these dried out the birds moved to suitable estuaries and tidal lagoons. Breeding now occurs more widely and during drier periods the birds have large areas of suitable refugia where they can sit out these periods of aridity, thus increasing the survival rate of the individuals, especially the less experienced young.</p><p>This elegant wader has a rather scattered breeding and non-breeding range occurring in a belt from England through much of southern Europe across to China. The population in Africa is dependent on suitable waters from Ethiopia south through East Africa to South Africa and Namibia. Recently it has been found that birds occurring southwards from Kenya (and probably Ethiopia) differ from those of Europe in that they attain a red eye, rather than the normal brown, once adulthood is reached sometime in their second year. It is not known if there is presently any interchange between East African birds and their southern counterparts, the latter appearing to be nomadic within their range, only moving as far north as southern Zambia and Angola on occasions. European birds are variably resident to short-distance migrants with part of the population moving south into Africa to suitable coastal areas and to the Sahelian region where they occupy natural pan systems and riparian floodplains. It is unlikely that these migrants come any further south than northern Kenya in the east but it is suggested that they penetrate as far as Angola in the west although there is little satisfactory evidence to indicate whether these are northern or southern birds.</p><p>This elegant wader has a rather scattered breeding and non-breeding range occurring in a belt from England through much of southern Europe across to China.

The young can fly at about 5-6 weeks and although superficially like the adults, have much brown scalloping on the back and wings, and the head is a mottled brown and blackish. The transition to adult plumage is gradual over the ensuing year. Breeding maturity is delayed and productivity is probably low, hence birds may be able to reach a significant age, the oldest bird in Europe attaining in excess of 24 years. An interesting observation from Vo?lvlei, near Mossel Bay, showed that after feeding, adults would gather in one flock to preen and digest their food while the young would gather in a second nearby group for the same purpose, having fed alongside their parents. Breeding appeared to be well synchronised. Chicks have been seen on rare occasions to dive under water to escape predators.</p><p>As indicated above, the southern African population has grown considerably, and is now roughly estimated at between 15&#160;000 and 25 000 birds. The areas of greatest concentrations are found at Walvis Bay and Swakopmund, the south-western Cape, Port Elizabeth area, the pans of the Free State as well as the huge ephemeral pans of Etosha and Makgadikgadi. Concentrations of over 1&#160;000 birds may be found on occasions but the highest counts were of over 4&#160;000 birds at Walvis Bay and 3&#160;580 at Rysana Pan in the Makgadikgadi system of Botswana.</p>",

They patrol roads, reed beds and fields, flying at about the same height as a foraging harrier, and they plunder the eggs or chicks in any nest they spot. They eat anything they can scavenge or catch, including mice and mole rats, bats, lizards, locusts, small tortoises and snakes. They feed on spilt grain, walking about and picking it up in company with doves and sparrows, and occasionally grabbing one of these birds and flying off with it, or killing and eating it on the spot.</p><p>Pied Crows are rapacious omnivores and significant predators.

On municipal rubbish dumps and landfills they compete with other scavengers for decomposing items, but they also have a sweet tooth, probing for the nectar of large aloes, such as the Mountain Aloe Aloe marlothii, the flower stalks of which are strong enough to support a Pied Crow’s half-kilogram weight. They are accomplished pirates (coincidentally with appropriate colours) that don’t hesitate to chase and molest prey-carrying raptors such as kites or kestrels in mid-air, forcing them to drop their prey, which they then deftly snatch in flight.</p><p>Like some other members of their family (notably magpies) they are also thieves with a penchant for shiny objects. This fascination is sometimes manifested in their choice of nesting material. The nest, usually sited in a tall tree (or on a windmill or telephone pole in treeless areas), is traditionally built of sticks, but Pied Crows often include wire in the foundation. Some nests are composed entirely of wire, probably obtained from rubbish dumps along with rags and paper used for nest lining. The same nest may be used year after year, because wire nests are much more durable than stick nests which disintegrate with age.</p><p>In southern Africa the Pied Crow is the main host of the Great Spotted Cuckoo, with close to 13% of their nests parasitised by the cuckoos where these two species overlap. The cuckoo’s eggs, up to four of which may be deposited in a single crow’s nest, have a similar greenish colour and spotty pattern to the eggs of the host, but are only about three-quarters the size. One might expect a clever crow to be aware that something is amiss, but it accepts the eggs and raises the cuckoo chicks, to the detriment of its own which are slower growing, and rarely survive to fledge.</p>",

The male has a double breast band while the female has a single band. They are not particularly noisy birds but do have a distinctive, high-pitched, squeaky twitter. They are always associated with water, where they hunt for fish and frogs, also taking some insects and crustaceans.</p><p>This is the most common and most widespread of all our kingfishers. These birds are found throughout most of southern Africa apart from the Namib Desert and the driest parts of the Kalahari and western Karoo. They have a very wide distribution in Africa, and their range extends eastwards through the Middle East to eastern and southern Asia.</p><p>This is the most common and most widespread of all our kingfishers. These birds are found throughout most of southern Africa apart from the Namib Desert and the driest parts of the Kalahari and western Karoo. They have a very wide distribution in Africa, and their range extends eastwards through the Middle East to eastern and southern Asia.</p><p>Although resident at perennial wetlands such as the Okavango Swamps and major rivers, during the summer rainy season in the north, many move away from these wetlands into surrounding areas where ephemeral pans fill up with water. These provide a rich source of food in the form of shrimps and fish which have hatched from eggs left in the sand in the bottom of the pans from the previous wet season.</p><p>The Pied Kingfisher’s ability to hover has opened up a foraging niche unavailable to other southern African kingfishers. At Lake Kariba, Pied Kingfishers have thrived on the introduced Kapenta – these are small fish which spend much of their time at or near the surface. Each morning the kingfishers fly out over Lake Kariba, far from land, and hover before diving into the water in pursuit of fish. When hovering, it is noticeable that the bird ‘hangs’ with the head pointing down to the water – despite the beating wings, the head is held almost motionless while the bird aims at the fish in the water below. The bird folds its wings and drops, headfirst, into the water. However, fishing far from land constrains the birds to catching small fish that can be handled and swallowed in the air. In the evening the birds return to tree-covered islands to roost for the night, sometimes gathering in loose aggregations of hundreds of birds on a single island.</p><p>Pied Kingfishers do not only eat small fish, but if they are to hunt larger specimens they, like other kingfishers, require a perch. If a large fish is caught, especially one like a bullhead which has a head too large to swallow whole, the bird retires to a perch and proceeds to bash the fish to pulp. I watched a Pied Kingfisher spend almost half an hour systematically bashing the head of a 125 mm ‘bully’, by holding the tail and thumping the head on the perch. This went on until the head was completely pulped, at which point the kingfisher deftly threw the fish into the air and swallowed it headfirst.</p><p>Although most breeding takes place in the spring, it is regulated to some degree by water levels. In the southern Cape I have watched this species nesting in midwinter when water levels have stabilised after heavy rains. The drop in water level exposes banks along rivers and streams. When breeding starts, the bank is often still moist and is easier to excavate.</p><p>Because the adults do not remove any food remains from the nest, the chamber becomes progressively lined with bits of fish bone and scales. One can always tell when there are chicks in the nest because adults, including the helpers, catch a fish and turn it round in the bill so that the head is held outwards. This enables the adult to put the fish into the chick’s mouth head first, so that the chick can swallow the fish without the spines getting stuck in its throat.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Endemic to South Africa, this species was formerly in the genus Spreo along with some East African starlings. However, genetic analysis indicates that it is simply a rather dull-plumaged glossy starling. A hundred years ago, Pied Starlings nested in the walls of the Castle in Cape Town, and they still occur in small rural towns and villages in South Africa. However, as settlements become more urbanised, they tend to move out. With their confident manner, Pied Starlings are familiar to many South Africans, yet their interesting social habits were overlooked for a long time. They almost always occur in flocks, which can be very large, especially those gathering to roost in trees or reed beds during the non-breeding period. They feed largely on the ground, striding about and sometimes flicking aside leaves and cowpats, but they never probe the soil, unlike Common or Wattled Starlings, with which they often associate.</p><p>Pied Starlings are easily aged: first-year birds have dark eyes, matt black plumage, and a white gape; subadults acquire an oily sheen on their body plumage, the outer part of the iris is creamy-white, and the gape and base of the lower mandible become yellow.  By the end of their second year the iris is completely white, while more than half the lower mandible is yellow – most birds first breed at this age. In a foraging flock, food exchanges may occur – on finding a food item, an individual adopts an upright posture and struts towards another bird. The recipient crouches and gapes like a young bird before taking the proffered food, but if it should refuse the gift, the donor eats it. Such allofeeding (feeding another individual in the group) often occurs between members of different age classes, and is unrelated to courtship. It is thought to ‘confirm’ social bonds between Pied Starlings that have helped to raise a brood together, since this species is a co-operative breeder with up to seven birds feeding the chicks in a single nest.</p><p>Pied Starlings are easily aged: first-year birds have dark eyes, matt black plumage, and a white gape; subadults acquire an oily sheen on their body plumage, the outer part of the iris is creamy-white, and the gape and base of the lower mandible become yellow.

Some traditional nest sites have hundreds of holes in a single bank. The nest is lined with a variety of material, including leaves, shed snake skins, wool, grass and baling twine. Only the female incubates the eggs, while the male often sits nearby, warbling for long periods; when she comes out to feed, the pair flies off together. The song includes soft musical elements as well as harsh grating notes. Once the eggs hatch, other individuals, usually subadults and first-year birds, assist the parents by bringing food for the chicks. There seems to be no hierarchy in feeding, with the birds often lined up in front of the nest entrance, taking turns to feed. Their prey often includes large, readily identified items like centipedes, solifugids and even lizards. After the chicks fledge, they continue to beg, and are fed by the adults and helpers for at least a week.</p><p>In some areas Pied Starlings are regular brood hosts of Great Spotted Cuckoos, and cuckoo chicks may be seen accompanying the flock; they also are parasitised occasionally by Greater Honeyguides. This is more serious for the host species, as the honeyguide nestling destroys its nest mates, whereas some young starlings may survive sharing a nest with a Great Spotted Cuckoo. Monitor lizards rob some nests, and they are mobbed by the starlings if they approach a colony. Boomslangs also raid nests if they can get in from the top of the bank.</p>",

Thus records of Red-throated Twinspot from the northern Kruger National Park are likely to refer to this species. The Pink-throated Twinspot has a very restricted distribution entirely within southern Africa, and it is currently considered Near-threatened in South Africa and Swaziland. It is one of five species with limited geographical ranges which serve to define the ‘South-east African Coast Endemic Bird Area’. Although it is found in a number of protected areas in South Africa, the population in coastal Mozambique lacks effective protection. Information from Mozambique indicates that as many as 2&#160;000 birds may be exported annually for the cage-bird trade. However, it must be emphasised that we lack any accurate assessment of population numbers, since this is a shy bird which seldom emerges for long from the dense vegetation, and is most often recorded by call rather than visually.  The birds feed mostly on the ground, taking small seeds and probably also insects, since aviary birds readily eat various small insects. Pink-throated Twinspots are sometimes encountered in small groups, perhaps family parties, and may associate with other waxbills.</p><p>Only two nests have been reported from wild populations, and thus there is no information on breeding success. Both nests were more than one metre above ground, well concealed in thickets: a ball of dry grass with a side entrance, and some leaf ribs and spider web included in the outside structure. Inside, the nests were lined with fine grass and feathers. Clutches of three pure white eggs seem typical in captivity, and the incubation and nestling periods are similar to those of other waxbills. Observations on aviary birds suggest that Pink-throated Twinspots are monogamous, with both male and female taking turns at incubation, and feeding the young. In South Africa it appears that the Zambezi Indigobird imitates the song of the Pink-throated Twinspot, which would suggest that it parasitises this species. Generally parasitism by indigobirds appears to have little overall impact on waxbill populations, and compared to habitat loss and the removal of birds by the cage-bird trade, this cannot be considered a major threat to the survival of the species.</p><p>Only two nests have been reported from wild populations, and thus there is no information on breeding success.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Pink-backed Pelicans are far less common than Great White Pelicans, but nonetheless range over much of the wetter parts of the north and east of southern Africa. They are nomadic in response to changing wetland conditions and may suddenly arrive on a pan or dam well outside their core range. They can occur in large numbers when food becomes concentrated, but normally one finds small groups of three to ten birds. These groups may or may not be associated with the Great White Pelicans. Where they are, it is obvious that the Pink-backed Pelican is far more lightly built and the smaller of the two. Nevertheless, they are still large and fairly heavy birds which labour to take off, but once airborne they fly gracefully and may soar on thermals to considerable heights.</p><p>When the two species are seen together, it is conspicuous that the pouch below the bill of this species is smaller than that of the Great White Pelican. It is a pinkish colour whereas the pouch of the larger bird is yellow. The pouch skin is thin and soft and fish spines can puncture the skin so that when the bird scoops up water fine jets of water may be seen coming from the pouch.</p><p>When the two species are seen together, it is conspicuous that the pouch below the bill of this species is smaller than that of the Great White Pelican.

Many bird species, including both pelican species, were attracted to the abundant food available. The bird swims along with the head held high until it sees a fish near the surface ahead of it. The head is then drawn back and shot forward, using the neck to get the beak in range of the fish, which is grasped and secured in the bill pouch. The bird then lifts its head carefully out of the water, draining excess water from the pouch, before the fish is tossed into the air and swallowed head first.</p><p>Breeding colonies are normally in areas with plenty of large trees. The colony on the Chobe River in northern Botswana is situated in the adjacent riverine forest. These birds build a large stick nest which contrasts with the rather rudimentary ground nest of the Great White Pelican. Although Pink-backed Pelicans usually lay two or three eggs, it is very unusual for any but the first-hatched chick to survive because the oldest chick will kill any younger chick in the nest. This behaviour, widespread among birds of prey, is termed the Cain and Abel Syndrome. Towards the end of the nestling period the colonies can become extremely smelly and the ground below is littered with the chicks’ droppings, along with rotting fish which have been missed when being passed from adult to chick. &#9;</p>",

They are small, compact larks with the short conical beaks typical of seedeaters. Seen at close range, something habitually not easy to achieve, the most obvious feature in the Pink-billed Lark is the red bill. This character is shared with its closest relative, the rare and more localised Botha’s Lark. Both also show a distinctive blackish Y-shaped marking below the eye.</p><p>The Pink-billed Lark is near-endemic to southern Africa but extends into Zambia. Four subspecies of the Pink-billed Lark occur across its wide range in southern Africa, and the birds in the drier west and north are paler, and in some instances greyer, than the more rufous and richly coloured birds in the south-east. It inhabits grasslands, often fairly tall, in a wide range of biomes, from the mesic South African highveld to the arid Nama Karoo and Kalahari. The species also regularly forages in disturbed ground, for example along road verges and in fallow fields.</p><p>The Pink-billed Lark is near-endemic to southern Africa but extends into Zambia.

The species also regularly forages in disturbed ground, for example along road verges and in fallow fields.</p><p>Pink-billed Larks, like others of the genus, are gregarious and typically found in small flocks. The species has a soft but distinctive double-note trilling call, usually given when disturbed. This lark will also indulge in a bouncing flight at such times but like most Spizocorys larks it lacks a distinct aerial display flight. Gordon Maclean rightly suggested that although “this species must have a song, it seems to be indistinguishable from the flight notes”, and even that most of the song may be “too high-pitched for the human ear to hear”. As is typical of granivores generally, the Pink-billed Lark drinks regularly and is nomadic. Its diet comprises seeds, especially grass seeds, supplemented with insects.</p><p>The breeding biology of this lark has been studied in detail by Gordon Maclean in the Kalahari and, more recently, Derek Engelbrecht and Mandlenkosi Mathonsi at Mogwadi in Limpopo Province. The breeding season varies across the range but with a tendency for late summer nesting.</p><p>Spizocorys larks are unusual in the family in that both sexes contribute to nest-building, incubation and provisioning of the nestlings, a commitment to parental investment by the male only shared with the sexually dimorphic sparrow-larks. Many aspects of the breeding biology seem adapted to exploit the highly ephemeral nature of suitable nesting conditions. Nests may be loosely aggregated. The structure itself, typically built in quite tall grassland, is a simple cup. It often has an apron of coarser material, very occasionally incorporating spider web, animal dung and the ‘tubular casings’ of harvester termites, which extend over the sides. Breeding is a speedy affair and egg-laying usually begins within two days, sometimes just one day, of the nest being initiated, but nest-building also continues well into incubation. The clutch size is small, typically two eggs, but one- and three-egg clutches have been recorded. Spizocorys larks are also strange in starting incubation with the first egg. This results in asynchronous hatching, but oddly all nestlings leave the nest on the same day. The eggs apparently always hatch within two hours of sunrise.</p><p>Food provided to nestlings at Mogwadi was determined using digital photography and up to four prey items were brought at once. Two-thirds comprised invertebrates, including grasshoppers, stick insects, termites, and butterflies, moths and caterpillars. Seeds made up the balance of their menu. Young leave the nest as early as 10 days old, well short of being able to fly. As with many ground-dwelling passerines, breeding success is low, especially during incubation, but replacement attempts after failure have not been recorded, nor is double-brooding known.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Pintado or Cape Petrel is one of the most charismatic birds of the Southern Ocean, thanks to its distinctive plumage and confiding behaviour while following ships, approaching closer than most other birds and sometimes flying over the deck. It also often follows groups of whales, eating prey stirred up by their passage, and may have learned to follow ships in part because of this association. It is gregarious, occurring in groups from a few individuals in the open ocean to hundreds or thousands of birds at fishing vessels operating at the continental shelf break. It is a fairly small, compact petrel. Like most fulmarine petrels it has stiff, shallow wing beats, but it is also an accomplished soarer, particularly adept at riding the updrafts around ships.</p><p>Adults start replacing their primaries while still provisioning chicks. Non-breeders and failed breeders moult even earlier in summer, with some birds replacing 5-7 primaries at once, greatly impairing their flying ability. Because of this early start to their moult, most birds have completed moult by the time they reach southern Africa, so we seldom see scruffy-looking birds (unlike most other non-breeding seabirds that visit the region).</p><p>Adults start replacing their primaries while still provisioning chicks.

When feeding in the waste stream from trawlers, it pecks rapidly, several times a second, presumably taking many small items. However, small crustaceans are also captured by filtering water through its serrated bill margins, which act as strainers, using its muscular tongue as a pump. It can also dive quite well, swimming with its head submerged to look for prey items, then, diving down using its wings and feet, remaining underwater for up to 30 seconds. When one secures a large prey item, it often flies off with it to reduce the risk of having it stolen. It uses scent to help locate productive feeding areas, and is strongly attracted to slicks of krill-scented oil.</p><p>Pintado Petrels breed across a wide latitudinal range, from the edges of Antarctica to sub-Antarctic islands. Virtually the only sub-Antarctic islands where they don’t breed are South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands. Those breeding in the north of the species’ range are largely sedentary, whereas those breeding farther south are migratory, moving north in winter. Unlike most small petrels, they do not breed in burrows, but lay their single egg in a shallow scrape on the ground, often on a cliff but sometimes on level ground. They breed in loose colonies and rely on their ability to regurgitate stomach oils to deter avian predators such as skuas and giant petrels.</p><p>Pintado Petrels occur throughout southern African waters, but are most common off the Western and Eastern Cape. Here they congregate at fishing vessels, and are much more abundant at the shelf break than over the shelf or in adjacent oceanic waters. Even within shelf-break waters, their distribution is patchy, linked to the distribution of recent fishing effort. They are common from May to November, with a few birds remaining through summer. The presence of good numbers of birds into November, when adults are returning to their colonies, suggests that a large proportion of birds reaching southern Africa are immatures or non-breeders. Some are killed accidentally on fishing gear, but populations are mostly stable and the species is not listed as threatened.</p>",

The call sites used by males seem to be traditional, with the same individual sometimes returning in successive seasons, and the occupant usually soon replaced by another male if he disappears. The old common name ‘king-of-six’ was based on the observation that a breeding male is often accompanied by a small group of birds in dull female-type plumage, who were assumed to be his ‘wives’. Closer inspection, however, usually reveals that some of these birds are subadult males, and the group is not a harem, but simply a loose association of members of the same species. During the non-breeding season, when the adult males also revert to a female-like eclipse plumage, the Pin-tailed Whydah will form small flocks, which often join larger assemblages of other seed-eating birds, including waxbills, bishops and even larger weavers, or canaries. They spend much of their time feeding on the ground, where they progress by hopping or shuffling, like many birds which are not specialised for life at ground level.</p><p>This was the first member of the viduine group (whydahs and indigobirds/widowfinches) which was shown to be a brood parasite, on the basis of observations both in the field and in aviaries.

Mimicry of the calls or songs of the host species has also not been reported for the Pin-tailed Whydah.</p><p>The mating system of the Pin-tailed Whydah is best described as ‘promiscuous’ since both males and females may mate with different partners in the course of a single day. Males sing from prominent perches, chasing off other males, and courting potential mates in a bouncing, hovering display. These approaches can be quite undiscriminating, with the males attempting to court any small brownish bird which lands within their territory, and sometimes even directing the display towards most unlikely partners such as sunbirds or shrikes. Females, after mating, must find a host nest in which to lay their eggs, and they are seldom accompanied by the male at this stage. More than one egg may be laid in a single nest, while the female usually removes and eats a host egg. The most frequent host species in our region is the Common Waxbill, with Orange-breasted Waxbill parasitised occasionally and a single confirmed record of the Swee Waxbill as a host. Other records based on the presence of eggs in a nest have not been confirmed by observations of young whydahs being raised successfully. The young whydahs and waxbills are reared together, even though they have distinctly different begging movements. The mouth markings of the whydah chicks are similar to those of their usual hosts, though not a perfect match. It seems that at the population level, parasitism has little impact on any of the host species.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This nondescript pipit was first described in 1818 by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot (1748-1831) from the Cape of Good Hope. It is possible that the early settlers who came ashore in South Africa would have been greeted by Plain-backed Pipits patrolling the Cape’s picturesque sandy beaches; this species is known to forage around kelp and seaweed washed to the high-tide mark.</p><p>Vieillot’s nominate subspecies occurs across much of South Africa as well as the lower-lying parts of Lesotho, western Swaziland and south-eastern Botswana. It occurs in moist grasslands up to 2&#160;000&#160;m in altitude, as well as parts of the Karoo, Fynbos and savanna biomes. Topographically, it prefers gentle slopes or rolling hills but also occurs on flatter ground. It is most numerous in areas with short grass cover to virtually no vegetation, whether due to grazing, trampling, mowing, agriculture or burning. The latter dynamic seems to play an important role in their occurrence: one to two years after Fynbos fires, the birds occur at relatively high densities (up to twenty birds per square kilometre) in relatively sparse and short vegetation; after five years the vegetation becomes too dense to support this species.</p><p>Vieillot’s nominate subspecies occurs across much of South Africa as well as the lower-lying parts of Lesotho, western Swaziland and south-eastern Botswana.

They can often be seen in areas heavily grazed by large game animals. Beyond our borders the Plain-backed Pipit’s range extends widely across sub-Saharan Africa, where a further seven subspecies are recognised.</p><p>When breeding the Plain-backed Pipit is usually found in pairs that keep in contact with short, stuttering calls, also given when flushed or in alarm. Breeding males proclaim their territory ownership with a slow, measured song consisting of sparrow-like notes repeated at varying intervals: typically one note per second when singing from a rock, termite mound, fence post or telephone wire, and two notes per second during an aerial display flight.</p><p>The nest is a roughly constructed grass structure with a warmly lined inner cup and is placed in or among grass tufts or sometimes against a rock. It is partly concealed by overhanging grass blades and can be very difficult to locate. Only once did I discover a pair’s nest by accident, and not through extended sleuthing, when I flushed a female virtually underfoot; she flew to a nearby rock, eyed me warily, squatted down and then proceeded to lay an egg! I placed the warm egg gently in the nest, and left the area immediately; hoping fervently that the female would return and commence incubation.</p><p>After breeding, Plain-backed Pipits are more sociable and may be seen in flocks of twenty or more. Their movements are poorly understood, but at least some birds seem to shift to lower altitudes in winter. They frequently mix with other species, particularly on recently burned fields, in which case they can be directly compared – a great help when it comes to the identification of this incredibly difficult group. As its name implies, this species has unmarked, or at most, lightly mottled upperparts that limit the identification options. A word of warning – juvenile Plain-backed Pipits look very different from their parents, not least in having boldly marked upperparts. The scientific name points out the whitish eyebrow.</p><p>Apart from a small seed component, Plain-backed Pipits feed on insects and small invertebrates; ants and beetles make up a large part of their diet, but grasshoppers, crickets, termites, moths, mantids, bugs, flies and caterpillars are also taken, as are small snails and spiders.</p>",

It is not immediately recognisable as a sunbird; its bill is short and straight and it generally lacks iridescent plumage. Confusion with immature Variable Sunbirds is easy but they always have a black tail, not a green white-eye-like tail like that of the Plain-backed Sunbird.</p><p>An intensive study of this bird in the Tembe Elephant Park by Chittenden and Davies produced only three birds in a five-hectare patch of sand forest having the additional feature of tall emergent Forest Newtonia Newtonia hildebrandtii trees.

Although they foraged mostly below three metres in low vegetation, the tall emergent trees seemed to be important to them as the males would spend a couple of hours early each morning singing from high in these trees.

The French naturalist and explorer François le Vaillant, who collected the first specimen of this bird somewhere in the Eastern Cape, coined the name, calling it ‘Le Pririt’ (in French this would be pronounced as ‘Le Pri-ree’).</p><p>The Pririt Batis is usually seen in pairs, or as a family group of two adults with one or two young birds. They habitually forage in the middle and lower portions of the canopies of small trees or bushes, and are thus seen feeding at lower levels than other batis species, though when frequenting tall Acacia woodland they also forage in the tops of the larger trees. When traversing gaps between tree crowns or thickets they often indulge in a bouncy, wing-snapping flight display.</p><p>The Pririt Batis is usually seen in pairs, or as a family group of two adults with one or two young birds.

When traversing gaps between tree crowns or thickets they often indulge in a bouncy, wing-snapping flight display.</p><p>The adult male is hard to distinguish from the Chinspot Batis, with which it overlaps on the northern and eastern borders of its range, but its distinctive, loud descending series of ‘peep’ notes serves to give notice of its presence, and the males sing a great deal when breeding. By contrast, the ginger-breasted female is unique in the batis tribe and immediately identifiable as a Pririt Batis. Along the southern fringe of its range the Pririt Batis occurs alongside the Cape Batis in wooded stream gullies, and the two species have been recorded nesting within one metre of each other without dispute.</p><p>The female Pririt Batis does most of the nest construction, with only occasional input from her mate. She is also responsible for incubating the two eggs, and is frequently fed by the male while sitting. The nest is normally well camouflaged, with the exterior decorated with bark and occasional dead leaves. It is built in a shaded position on a slender horizontal branch, often adjacent to the main vertical stem, where it can easily be mistaken for a knot or gall in the branch.</p><p>Once the eggs hatch, the male shares the provisioning of the nestlings. During the late spring and summer months, the dry, semi-desert habitat favoured by this batis is subject to high daytime temperatures. In nests not adequately shaded from hot sunlight the female may stand over her brood with spread wings to shade them. One observer noted a shivering of the wings and suggested that the female could have been fanning the chicks.</p><p>The Pririt Batis is a frequent host of Klaas’s Cuckoo (7% of 76 clutches recorded in Namibia were parasitised). In spite of this unwelcome attention, however, the Pririt Batis is a thriving species with comparatively high nesting success. This batis also appears to benefit from bush encroachment, resulting from increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere as well as from overgrazing by cattle. Its numbers are significantly higher in such degraded areas than in adjacent, less shrubby environments. &#9;</p>",

It follows the fynbos-covered mountain chains and has a similar distribution to the other fynbos endemics – Victorin’s Warbler, Cape Sugarbird, Orange-breasted Sunbird and Cape Siskin. But curiously, and like Victorin’s Warbler, it does not occur on the Cape Peninsula.</p><p>It is one of the species most sought after by birders visiting the Western Cape and it is also one of the most difficult to locate as it seldom sings out of the breeding season and tends to forage and drink in sheltered places rather than in the open. Once its low-key ‘tree-lee-loo’ contact call is learnt, it is much easier to find but it is still seldom conspicuous. The Protea Seedeater could be confused with the White-throated Canary with which it overlaps in drier habitats but the former shows more white on the throat and lacks the yellow rump.

Rather, it favours scrubby hillsides where there are scattered large protea bushes, especially Waboom Protea nitida. It is also quite at home in stands of the alien and invasive Cluster Pines Pinus pinaster, providing these are interspersed with patches of fynbos. Sometimes one encounters Protea Seedeaters in semi-arid landscapes, well away from pure fynbos. One has been seen, in full song, in an isolated stand of Protea laurifolia in MontEco Nature Reserve near Montagu on the fringe of the Little Karoo. Even more surprisingly one was observed in a belt of Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo on the plains to the north of Anysberg, perhaps en route to the fynbos on the Swartberg, 35 km away.</p><p>During the breeding season the male is very vocal and, surprisingly for a seedeater, the song is interspersed with excellent imitations of many local birds, notably Greater Striped Swallow, Malachite Sunbird and Cape Sugarbird. Nests are usually placed in a protea bush, frequently in a Waboom, but on occasion a pine tree is chosen. Most nests are less than three metres above the ground, but one nest on the slopes of Helderberg above Somerset West was built 4.5 m high in a Cluster Pine. The nest is well lined with protea down, often the brown fluff of Protea neriifolia.</p><p>There is no evidence to indicate regular local migration, but the extensive fires that characterise the Cape Fold Mountains must necessitate local movement at times. These seedeaters require mature fynbos in which to forage and nest, and after a summer of extensive fires there is often little suitable habitat remaining. In recent years vast tracts of mountain vegetation, from the Cedarberg to the mountains of the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, have been burnt: this must have serious consequences for the Protea Seedeater population. Fynbos does require regular burning and recovers quickly enough, but when a large proportion of the mountain vegetation is only a few years old, those bird species that require mature fynbos to survive, such as Protea Seedeater, are adversely affected.</p>",

The Miombo Double-collared Sunbirds are much more conspicuous than the Purple-banded Sunbirds, therefore most people notice them rather than the latter. Nevertheless, the latter are present and can be seen fairly easily in many areas, particularly in the north-east of the country, where they can be seen in many game and nature reserves. They occur regularly in the gardens of Harare where they feed alongside the Miombo species.</p><p>Along the coastal fringe of Mozambique I saw them in the bush which occurs some distance back from the beach. They were common and conspicuous – it was December and the males were calling loudly from the top of many bushes.</p><p>In its favoured areas this sunbird can be quite common and may be located by the high-pitched trill given by the male. The birds feed mainly on nectar, and certainly in the coastal bush they may occur in fairly large numbers at trees or bushes which have nectar-bearing flowers, including trees such as Eucalyptus growing outside of their favoured forest-edge haunts. They are one of a number of species attracted to the ‘Loranthus’ mistletoe. They also eat insects and spiders, finding these by gleaning through leaves and small branches. They have been recorded hawking termite alates at a hatch; probably this is true of all sunbird species. They also hawk flies, and are known to eat mainly soft-skinned insects.</p><p>These birds breed in spring and throughout summer, and the female builds the nest without the help of her mate. The nest is a typical oval shape with an entrance hole near the top, on one side. Unlike nests of some of the other sunbirds, this one does not have a ‘porch’ roof protruding over the entrance. The birds normally place the nest about two to three metres above the ground, but I have seen a nest in a garden in Harare which was about eight metres above the ground in a tall Musasa tree Brachystegia spiciformis. The female does all the incubation of the eggs, but once the chicks have hatched the male helps to feed them.</p>",

In fact, they are at home in just about any habitat that is dominated by large, densely foliaged trees, and that is below about 1&#160;300 metres altitude. There are exceptions. In the Zambezi River valley, for example, they are not confined to riverine woodland but also occur in miombo and mopane woodland: they are particularly widespread in the well-developed miombo woodlands along the Zimbabwe watershed above 1&#160;400 metres. They also occur in subtropical and tropical suburban gardens with large trees and a supply of fruit (papaya fruits are a favourite). For example, they are common in well-wooded suburbs such as Westville near Durban, South Africa, and have become very common in Harare and, to a lesser extent, Marondera in Zimbabwe. Patches of alien, juicy-fruited trees such as Bugweed Solanum mauritianum usually have a few of the birds calling and foraging.</p><p>Purple-crested Turacos eat a wide variety of fruits, from small Tassel-berry Antidesma venosum fruits, to larger Jackal-berry Diospyros mespiliformis and Nyala-tree Xanthocercis zambesiaca fruits. The fruits of more than 32 species of indigenous plants have been recorded in their diet, and fruits of at least nine species (or varieties) of cultivated or alien invasive plants are also eaten. The birds forage in the canopy, plucking fruits directly from the ends of branches and bounding along branches in the canopy to reach other fruit clusters, or running nimbly along branches to chase potential competitors. Purple-crested Turacos are usually solitary or in pairs, sometimes in groups of four to five birds that may be a family party. The birds drink water at any time of day, dipping bills in the water, throwing heads back to swallow, and repeating this until their thirst is quenched. They also use forest pools and bird baths to bathe, enthusiastically splashing while doing so.</p><p>The nest is a platform, rather like a very large and thick dove’s nest. It is constructed of sticks and is built by one bird using material brought by the other. Nest material is collected from the canopy, not from the ground. Nests are placed high in isolated trees, occasionally in densely foliaged bushes or tall, dense trees in gardens. The eggs are almost spherical, and are incubated by both adults. The young leave the nest before they can fly, and scramble around on branches near the nest.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Purple Herons are large but rather slender herons with exceptionally long bills and toes, and they have an attractive chestnut-and-slate plumage. ‘Purple’ is something of a misnomer as it is the chestnut-coloured neck and chest, more than anything else, that characterises the bird. This plumage works well in providing concealment in the marshy habitats that the birds frequent – areas of sedge and reed especially – as they blend into such backgrounds and are easily overlooked. Consequently one’s first encounter with this bird is often only once it has been disturbed from where it has been hunting and it flies away to another position.</p><p>Well-vegetated margins of lakes, pans, dams, marshy vegetation associated with seasonal wetlands and other still-water habitats that provide cover are the preferred habitat of this species, and it is unusual to see a Purple Heron wading out in open water as is routine for, say, a Grey Heron. Aside from this need for cover, Purple Herons forage in much the same way as other large herons, either standing motionless at one spot, or walking slowly forward, neck stretched out ahead, head angled sideways. When prey is sighted the bird stretches yet further forward while remaining rooted to the spot, sometimes becoming almost horizontal before lunging rapidly and snatching prey with its bill. Fish are the main food items taken, and those caught are typically 100-200 mm in length but anything else that they encounter that is moving, is likely to be consumed: frogs, small reptiles, small aquatic mammals, birds (such as the nestlings in a Yellow-crowned Bishop nest), and insects such as dragonflies and their larvae.</p><p>Well-vegetated margins of lakes, pans, dams, marshy vegetation associated with seasonal wetlands and other still-water habitats that provide cover are the preferred habitat of this species, and it is unusual to see a Purple Heron wading out in open water as is routine for, say, a Grey Heron.

The type specimen is stated to have come from the Danube River, and its range extends across southern and eastern Europe through to the Indomalaysian region and eastwards into China. In Africa it occurs widely, avoiding only the more arid regions and the areas of rainforest. There are many recoveries of birds ringed in the Western Palaearctic to show that these birds migrate south to overwinter in West Africa. But none, apparently, cross the equator, and to the south, including across much of southern Africa, the bird is resident and largely sedentary. That said, my experience with the bird on the extensive floodplain of the Nyl River in South Africa’s Limpopo Province shows that these birds arrive here in numbers, in years of extensive flooding, and as many as 100 pairs may breed in such years in the system’s extensive reed beds. But as the floodplain dries out so their numbers diminish, and years may go by before conditions recur which draw the birds back to the site.</p><p>Purple Herons invariably nest over water and mostly do so deep inside beds of Phragmites or Typha. They almost invariably nest colonially, either in smaller monospecific colonies that may number between two to three and a few dozen pairs, or single pairs join other communal breeders in large mixed-species heronries. Nesting behaviour is broadly similar to that of other herons, with both sexes participating in building the nest, in incubating the eggs and in tending to and feeding the young. The incubation and nestling periods are, respectively, approximately 26 and 30-35 days. Nestlings usually start wandering from the nest into the surrounding reeds well before they can fly and when parents arrive with food they scramble back to be fed, uttering an incessant, raucous ‘chak-chak-chak...’ It is often only at this stage of the nestling cycle, with the parents commuting to and from the site, and the sound of the chicks food-begging, that one becomes aware for the first time that these herons are nesting.</p>",

However, the characteristic ‘purr’ calls of Jameson’s Firefinch imitated by this species are probably the best indication of its identity. The Purple Indigobird avoids areas heavily grazed by cattle, seeming to favour thicker grass and undergrowth than the other indigobirds with which its range overlaps. In the non-breeding season, it regularly forms mixed flocks with waxbills and other indigobirds, and continues to make use of communal roost sites in tall leafy trees even while breeding. Observations of some ringed birds indicate that they remained within a limited area of less than 10 km².</p><p>During the breeding season, male Purple Indigobirds spend much of their day singing from a call site, to which the females are attracted. There is marked fidelity to these call sites, which are often used from one year to the next. The songs include a large portion of mimicry of Jameson’s Firefinch, and there are local differences between individuals, so that ‘song neighbourhoods’ can be mapped out. Males have been seen to mate with up to three females a day, and females often visit multiple males, so the mating system would seem to be promiscuous. If a female lands in a male’s territory, he courts her with a jerky flight display; mating usually occurs at the call site if the female solicits with tail movements. Mimetic song is also sung by the male during and immediately after copulation, when the male and female typically fly down to the ground and feed together before she leaves the territory.</p><p>During the breeding season, male Purple Indigobirds spend much of their day singing from a call site, to which the females are attracted.

Female indigobirds lay sets of 3-4 eggs, one egg each day. There have been few observations of this species at the nest. Mouth markings of the nestlings match those of the host’s chicks. Even after fledging, young Purple Indigobirds may be found in family parties with Jameson’s Firefinches. Juvenile males seem to visit the call sites of adults, and they may learn songs from these males, or this may reinforce the songs learnt in the nest from their foster parent.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Although not as brightly coloured as the Lilac-breasted Roller, the Purple Roller is conspicuous because of its size and habit of sitting on the highest point in an area. It is endemic to Africa, from West Africa (Senegal) east to Somalia and south to South Africa. In our area it is widespread in the more mesic savannas, but also occurs in very arid country, such as the Namib Desert. Movements in this species are complex. It is often claimed to be a partial migrant, with part of the population moving seasonally, and the proportion of the population that moves, increasing during droughts. It is generally sparse wherever it occurs, and is rather nomadic, suddenly arriving in an area after an absence of days or weeks. At Nylsvley Nature Reserve, for example, in September 1979, a male was recorded calling and displaying to a female in a grove of Eucalyptus trees, but not subsequently seen there. No Purple Rollers were seen on the reserve for the whole of 1980, but in 1981 the first Purple Roller was seen in May, and single birds were seen regularly after that until October, when they apparently moved on.</p><p>Like other rollers, the Purple Roller has an aerial, and noisy, display. This may be performed at any time of the year, but mostly during the breeding season. One bird, presumably the male, flies up above the trees, calling raucously, and then descends in rocking and rolling flight. Alternatively, the bird may display in a rapid horizontal rolling flight, continuously calling ‘gaa-aaa-aaaah’. The male feeds the female during courtship, a behaviour shared by other roller species. Yet despite these noisy displays, Purple Rollers are careful about revealing the location of a nest. One October in Nylsvley Nature Reserve I watched a male fly along the edge of African Seringa (Burkea africana) woodland, carrying a large insect. He flew to a female perched in a tree, and fed the insect to her. Both birds were frequently seen in the area and indeed in the same trees, but despite careful searches of the trees and in increasing circles around the trees, no nest was found. At the start of heavy rains in November, both birds had gone; it is unclear whether they attempted to breed in the area.</p><p>Like other rollers, the Purple Roller has an aerial, and noisy, display.

Others have also reported the use of vertical pipes as nest sites, and the question arises how the birds get up and down the pipe, particularly if the nest is a long way below the entrance. In more or less treeless areas, nests seem to be mainly in holes in rocks, usually a low cliff, or holes in earth banks. The same nest site may be regularly reused in successive seasons, and even twice in the same season, but it is unknown whether this involves the same pair each time. Two to four white eggs are laid. The incubation period is unknown. The young are fed by both parents. The birds are very wary at the nest, and (presumably) a male carrying food, apparently to feed young, simply remained on a perch near the nest, during the time I watched for 30 minutes or more. At the end of this time, it ate the food and flew off. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Weighing in at only 60 g, the Pygmy Falcon can look rather shrike-like in the field, and actually behaves rather like a shrike too. But closer inspection reveals that it has all the qualifying attributes of a proper raptor, such as a hooked bill, strong clawed feet, and a rapacious attitude, in miniature abundance. It occurs as two distinct populations in Africa – one in East Africa and one in the dry north-west of southern Africa. The sexes are dimorphic in plumage – males have plain grey backs, females have chestnut-coloured mantles – and they have much shorter tails and dumpier bodies than any open-country shrike in the region.</p><p>Pygmy Falcons occur in semi-arid woodlands extending from the southern Kalahari to north-western Namibia and marginally into southern Angola. They are active predators of insects, small reptiles, birds and mammals, with lizards, agamas and skinks probably making up the bulk of their diet. They usually take prey on the ground in sharp strikes made from a favourite, prominent hunting perch. Calling or displaying Pygmy Falcons habitually bob their heads and wag their tails up and down in a rather quaint and characteristic way, while flight between perches is rapid and undulating, with both this type of movement and the dark, white-spotted pattern on the dorsal wing surface strongly reminiscent of a woodpecker.</p><p>Pygmy Falcons occur in semi-arid woodlands extending from the southern Kalahari to north-western Namibia and marginally into southern Angola.

The southern African population is closely tied to the massive, domed communal nests built by Sociable Weaver Philetairus socius, with breeding pairs annexing one or two of the 10s or even 100s of nest chambers making up a given colony. Theoretically, this relationship should benefit both the tenants (the falcons) and the landlords (the weavers) in order for it to be so uniformly applied across the respective ranges of the two species. The most obvious explanation is that the falcons select the weaver colonies because they provide well insulated, protective chambers in which to breed and roost, and the weavers tolerate the presence of the falcons because they give a much needed boost to the defences of the colony, upping the collective firepower of its residents in combating the threat of predation by other raptors and snakes. This relationship seems to hold in some areas, but in others the falcons apparently betray the weavers’ trust by raiding occupied weaver nest chambers and eating chicks, and at least partially displacing colonies of weavers from their nest structures.</p><p>Another curious aspect of Pygmy Falcon breeding biology is that although they are predominantly monogamous, they are regularly observed breeding in groups of three birds, usually made up of a single female and two males. Such co-operative breeding is rare in raptors, and could occur for a number of reasons, mostly concerned with either the benefits of two unrelated males working together to raise a brood for which they have shared paternity, or the benefits for young males of not dispersing from their natal areas, but rather helping their parents raise their next brood of young. The genetic costs and benefits have not yet been worked out, but one promising theory suggests that young birds might initially delay dispersal in order to cuddle up with their parents in their selected weaver colony chamber, reaping the energetic benefits of group roosting through the cold winter nights of the Kalahari. Thereafter, assisting their parents to raise another brood the following spring might just be the best immediately available option should there be a shortage of breeding territory vacancies within their range of dispersal.</p>",

In display, the bird flies up vertically, closes its wings until it stalls, then dives down and levels out, rolling from side to side, calling raucously while doing so, and either perches or repeats the performance. Parts of the display, or the full display, may be given at any time of the year, but otherwise Racket-tailed Rollers are rather unobtrusive. They sometimes perch on a low stump or branch in full view, but typically perch quietly below the canopy and are only revealed when they swoop down on prey items on the ground. Food is poorly known, but includes grasshoppers, beetles, fly maggots, cicadas, and lizards and pygmy mice.</p><p>Racket-tailed Rollers are endemic to Africa. They occur from central Angola east to north-eastern Tanzania, and from there south to South Africa. The distribution in southern Africa is from Rundu in north-eastern Namibia, east through northern Botswana, over most of Zimbabwe, central and northern Mozambique, and north-eastern South Africa. Although common in parts of its range, it is generally sparse in southern Africa and is rare in South Africa, where it is largely confined to the northern parts of Kruger National Park. Racket-tailed Rollers occur in well-developed, mature, undisturbed deciduous woodland with little or no understorey, regardless of soil type. They occur in miombo and Zambezi Teak Baikiaea plurijuga (on Kalahari sands) and Mopane Colophospermum mopane and Leadwood Combretum imberbe woodlands (on poorly-drained clay soils). They are common in the tall Mopane woodland in south-eastern Zimbabwe, probably because of the abundance of suitable nest holes. In miombo woodland, where there are relatively few nest holes large enough for this species, the birds occur in tall trees at the base of rocky koppies.</p><p>Racket-tailed Rollers are endemic to Africa.

My experience of their nesting is that there was never more than a pair at the nest, but they are reported to be occasional co-operative breeders, with helpers at the nest. The nest is an unlined hole high in the main stem or relatively thick branch of a tree, either a natural cavity or a hole excavated by a large woodpecker. Two or three eggs are laid; beyond that there are no data on incubation duties, incubation period, development and care of the young or breeding success.</p><p>The conservation status of Racket-tailed Rollers is uncertain, but quite likely could be a cause for concern. Although the birds are fairly well represented in protected areas, mature, broad-leaved deciduous woodlands are being degraded (mostly for charcoal production) in the unprotected matrix over much of its distribution range, reducing habitat availability both in terms of foraging and nesting areas. &#9;</p>",

The result is that many have descriptive and creative names reflecting their diagnostic voices: Chirping; Croaking; Singing; Tinkling; Wailing; Zitting and the like. In the case of the Rattling Cisticola, the male’s incessant territorial proclamation consists of two to four introductory notes followed by a rattling or bubbling sound. While there is considerable local variation in the song’s tone and pitch, the structure of the phrase is consistent, making it one of the most recognisable and characteristic sounds in bushveld and savanna habitats.</p><p>The Rattling Cisticola is one of the most abundant bird species in the northern parts of the region and is likely to be encountered many times a day in habitats of mixed woodland, open savanna with scattered thickets and especially Acacia-dominated thornveld. Indeed, at the height of summer, the males’ songs seem to emanate from the crown of every second bush or small tree. The songsters usually perch openly, and further emphasise their persistent displays by flicking their tails and showing the black interior of their mouths by lifting the head as they call.</p><p>The Rattling Cisticola is one of the most abundant bird species in the northern parts of the region and is likely to be encountered many times a day in habitats of mixed woodland, open savanna with scattered thickets and especially Acacia-dominated thornveld.

If not directed at birders themselves, these calls may alert one to the presence of a snake, mongoose, hawk or, frequently, Pearl-spotted Owlet. Such alarm calls attract other bushveld birds which join the frenzied mob in an attempt to displace potential predators. Birders use the technique called ‘spishing’ or ‘pishing’ to the same effect: by producing hissing, sucking or scolding sounds, birders mimic the alarm calls of species such as the Rattling Cisticola, which may entice unseen birds out of hiding, if used sparingly. Different species respond to varying degrees, depending also on the season, habitat, region, time and weather.</p><p>Silent Rattlers can be tricky to identify, and regularly stump even experienced birders. Furthermore, five subspecies have been described to address the significant geographical variation exhibited by this species. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to get to know this common and widespread cisticola well, as it forms a useful basis for comparison against its relatives and a helpful exercise in the identification of LBJs in general.</p><p>Rattling Cisticolas are primarily insectivorous, and spend much time clambering slowly through dense grass and low thickets or hopping about on the ground in search of larvae, caterpillars, beetles, termites, ants, crickets, grasshoppers, flies, moths and other insects, as well as spiders and small snails. They will also drink nectar when available.</p><p>The well-hidden nest is constructed close to the ground, typically less than 30&#160;cm up, in dense vegetation or a thick grass tuft. Small thorn bushes with grass growing up through the bush, and thus untouched by grazing animals, are particularly favoured as nesting sites. The nest consists of a roughly oval-shaped structure with an entrance hole near the top of one side, and is constructed of dry grass blades and spider web with a warmly lined interior chamber. Two to four eggs are laid, which vary in colour from buffy white to blue, with varying amounts of speckles and blotches. The eggs are incubated by the female only, for approximately two weeks, and the young are then fed by both sexes for a further similar period before they leave the nest to hide in the surrounding vegetation.&#9;</p>",

There are records of Red-backed Mannikins being killed by Fork-tailed Drongos, and even by a large praying mantis.</p><p>Red-backed Mannikins are monogamous, nesting as solitary pairs. In contrast to some other waxbills, the courting male holds his bill open during most displays, and does not carry grass stems or other nesting material. The body posture is often crouched rather than upright, and tail-wagging by both sexes is a prominent element in their courtship display. Ritualised preening actions, with the bill closed, are carried out by the male – these apparently serve to highlight particular areas of the plumage, rather than contributing anything to feather care. The nest is a ball of dry grass (sometimes also with lichen or wild asparagus included) with a side entrance, lined with grass inflorescences and feathers. It is placed in a tree, bush or reeds and may be up to eight metres above the ground. Male and female share incubation during the day, but only the female sits in the nest at night. Both sexes feed the young. Hybrids with the Magpie Mannikin have been reported in captivity. Although Red-backed Mannikins do appear regularly in the cage-bird trade, this is not considered a major threat. In the coastal areas of South Africa they have certainly lost habitat to development, yet the species is widespread to the north of our region.</p>",

It has a more extensive breeding distribution than its congener, the Lesser Grey Shrike, being found both further north and further west in Eurasia. Both of our visitors enter Africa from the eastern Medi&#173;terranean, the most westerly birds initially heading south-east, and then migrate southwards through the eastern side of Africa only, spreading out once the forested regions of the Congo have been passed. Small numbers of birds remain in East Africa but the large majority spend the austral summer from Zambia and Malawi south to cover most of our subregion. Birds are sparse in the extreme south of their range and visitations are erratic. It is generally absent from the Namib Desert southwards to southern Namibia through the western Northern and Western Cape.</p><p>The numbers of Red-backed Shrike visiting the subregion have been roughly estimated to be more than 50 million, this based on densities of birds in different areas, although estimates from the breeding range suggest a lower figure of about 10 million. However, it is probably easier to determine numbers in the more restricted non-breeding range but on the other hand it is unlikely that this bird is a quarter as common as the ubiquitous Barn Swallow.</p><p>The numbers of Red-backed Shrike visiting the subregion have been roughly estimated to be more than 50 million, this based on densities of birds in different areas, although estimates from the breeding range suggest a lower figure of about 10 million. However, it is probably easier to determine numbers in the more restricted non-breeding range but on the other hand it is unlikely that this bird is a quarter as common as the ubiquitous Barn Swallow.</p><p>There has been a major range contraction in Britain, Netherlands and Belgium but an increase in Norway over the last 100 plus years, with a general reduction of numbers throughout its range. Although it is suggested that it requires sunny, sheltered, warm and dry habitats the increasing wetness of a British summer would militate against the bird but why then an increase in the very moist Norway? In Africa it prefers moister conditions than the Lesser Grey Shrike but favours open savanna with prominent perches and, especially, open Acacia parkland. Males are said to prefer more open country to females but it is more likely that the males dominate suitable hunting sites and females remain more inconspicuous skulking in bushes. This becomes obvious when trapping them in mist nets. However, in some areas, such as the Makgadikgadi region in Botswana, the females and immatures far outnumber the adult males.</p><p>Birds arrive from late October in the north and progressively later further south, peaking in mid- to late November, having departed Europe in August and September. There is a degree of staging further north in Africa during southward migration, otherwise birds would arrive earlier. In Zimbabwe the summer distribution in any given year is dependent on rainfall, with birds being found further north and east in drier years. Return migration takes place from late March and is most marked in the first ten days of April when there is a massive exodus. No birds remain in the subregion during the austral winter.</p><p>Ringing recoveries to and from our region are few, with birds from Germany found in Malawi (2) and Zimbabwe and from the Czech Republic in Malawi. Single birds ringed in Zambia in December have been recovered in the Czech Republic seven seasons later and one from Gauteng, also caught in December, found on northward migration in May in Yemen. This latter bird was probably en route to Eastern Europe. The birds found in Malawi were in the period 11 April to 15 May and may reflect the more easterly passage of birds at this time of year. There are a substantial number of records of birds returning to the area of original ringing up to five seasons later.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The common name comes from the original description by Andrew Smith, who apparently saw the birds foraging in association with buffalo. When feeding they do seem to favour areas which have been trampled by game or livestock. Males are black with a red bill and white patches in the wing, while the females are dull dark brown, with a paler, orange-pink bill. Young birds are pale brown, spotted or barred on the underside. Early collectors were particularly intrigued by a rod-like structure on the belly of the two Bubalornisspecies (the White-billed Buffalo Weaver B. albirostris occurs through the Sahel belt from West Africa to Ethiopia), and suggested that this might be a copulatory organ; it is much larger in males than in females. A quote in Bannerman’s book on The Birds of West Africa stated that this body part could be used to make ‘strong man medicine’!  In fact the rod is solid, and has no tubes or channels linking it to the reproductive system, so it cannot serve to transport sperm. Another explanation offered for its function was that it served to hold sticks which were carried up to the nest!</p><p>Both the social behaviour of the Red-billed Buffalo Weaver, and its mating behaviour, show features unique in the weaver family: both males and females may simultaneously have more than one mate, and copulation lasts much longer than in any other species. The nests built by the male birds with thorny twigs, and later lined by both sexes with grass for the egg chamber, are placed high in large trees such as Baobabs. Generally the largest trees in the area are favoured, and in Zimbabwe trees close to the road apparently are selected in preference to those further away. Possibly these trees grow larger, benefiting from run-off from the road surface. In some areas, windmills or other man-made structures are used as nesting sites. The nests are typically close together, and may coalesce into a communal nest mass.</p><p>Both the social behaviour of the Red-billed Buffalo Weaver, and its mating behaviour, show features unique in the weaver family: both males and females may simultaneously have more than one mate, and copulation lasts much longer than in any other species.

The technical term for such a mating system is a real jawbreaker: polygynandry. Copulation, which in most birds is a very rapid process with the cloaca (the common opening to the digestive, excretory and reproductive system) of the male in contact with that of the female for a matter of seconds, lasts for more than ten minutes in the Red-billed Buffalo Weaver, and it appears that the rod-like phallic organ plays a role in stimulating the partners. The female is responsible for all the incubation of the eggs, and males rarely feed the young.</p><p>Colonies are occupied year-round, and the nests are often used for roosting outside the breeding period. Nest chambers may also be occupied by waxbills, sparrows or other species, and sometimes raptors nest on top of a large nest mass. In Namibia, an aggressive paper wasp often suspends its nests from the underside of buffalo-weaver nests. Away from the colony, the birds feed largely on the ground, often in association with glossy starlings and with other weaver species. Their food is primarily insects and other arthropods, such as spiders and small scorpions, with occasional seeds and fruit.</p>",

The birds are mostly resident, with some local movement evident, and there are only minor plumage differences between the different populations.  In the wild, birds have survived at least seven years, unusual for such small bird species that face many dangers. These tiny waxbills are even occasional prey of large chameleons. Usually encountered in pairs or small groups, Red-billed Firefinches may associate with other seed-eating species when feeding. Most of their food is collected on the ground, and they bathe and drink regularly, flying at least one kilometre to water if necessary.</p><p>The pair bond seems to be especially strong in the Red-billed Firefinch, with a pair remaining together through the non-breeding season, often perched side by side in physical contact, and allopreening. They may make several breeding attempts together in one year, and in successive years, with about half the population surviving from one year to the next. In courtship, the male carries a feather or grass stem while bobbing and singing near the female. Song in this species seems to be more important in pair formation and pair maintenance than as a signal to other males.  Nevertheless the nests are well spaced out, indicating that other birds are excluded from the nesting area.</p><p>The pair bond seems to be especially strong in the Red-billed Firefinch, with a pair remaining together through the non-breeding season, often perched side by side in physical contact, and allopreening.

Nevertheless the nests are well spaced out, indicating that other birds are excluded from the nesting area.</p><p>The nest is a ball of dry grass stems and leaves, with a side entrance, apparently built solely by the male with the female a mere spectator. It is lined with feathers, carefully selected by the male, with damaged ones discarded. Additional feathers are brought to the nest throughout the incubation period. The nest is usually off the ground, just below the canopy of a tree or bush, sometimes in a thatched roof or hedge. Some pairs build on the ground, under fallen leaves or flattened grass. One pair nested several times near the top of a garden compost heap. Both sexes incubate and feed the nestlings; the eggshells are apparently eaten by the adults when the young hatch. When a bird enters the nest to incubate the eggs or brood the chicks, it drags a feather into the entrance. When it leaves, the feather is removed and dropped just in front of the entrance.</p><p>For a few days after fledging, the young return to roost in the nest.  There may be up to five breeding attempts in a single season, and close to 40% of the nests seem to raise at least one young bird successfully. The relationship between this species and its brood parasite, the Village Indigobird, has been well studied, both in the field and in captivity. Song mimicry by the indigobird is very accurate, and the two species are often found feeding together in mixed flocks, with no obvious aggression. Locally, up to 30% of Red-billed Firefinch nests may be parasitised by Village Indigobirds. Young are regularly raised together, even though a female indigobird may lay more than one egg in a firefinch nest, or several indigobirds may parasitise the same nest – there is a record of six indigobird eggs in one nest of a Red-billed Firefinch. There is a lower success rate for firefinches raising chicks of both species, though long-term studies in Senegal suggest that this may not be an important factor every season.</p>",

Anti-poaching patrols on windless days through areas of thorn scrub always carried the risk of a close encounter with a Black Rhinoceros. The risk was highest when the vegetation was too thick to run through, devoid of tall-enough trees to climb, but high enough to hide a rhinoceros completely. The first warning one gets is when the rhino’s oxpecker contingent fly up with a shrill chorus of twitters, alerting both the patrollers and the rhinoceros. The rhino usually moves off with alacrity in whatever direction it happens to be facing (hopefully the ‘opposite’ direction).</p><p>Red-billed and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers have unique symbiotic associations with large ungulate mammals, and they are the only two birds in the world that obtain most of their food in such a remarkable manner. Their specialisation cost them dearly when historically wide-ranging herds of game animals were exterminated by hunters, and organised farming practice introduced arsenical dips for cattle to reduce the risk of tick-vectored diseases. But the Red-billed Oxpecker managed to persist in protected areas such as the Kruger National Park and the Zululand game reserves. In the 1970s and 80s the change to bird-friendly dips in many places (especially in the Gweru District) resulted in oxpeckers moving back onto farms.</p><p>Red-billed and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers have unique symbiotic associations with large ungulate mammals, and they are the only two birds in the world that obtain most of their food in such a remarkable manner.

They have sharp edges to their beaks, enabling them to remove embedded ticks by what is aptly called ‘scissoring’ through the animal’s coat. They also remove scabs and infected or dying tissue and maggots (fly larvae) from open wounds; this ‘cleaning’ of wounds does not always endear them to farmers, but can be of benefit to the host animal.</p><p>Family groups of oxpeckers (often five in number) spend most of the daylight hours riding a host animal, and perform all their usual daily activities thereon, including (in the breeding season) courtship display and copulation. The host usually takes them to water, so the oxpeckers get the opportunity to drink and bathe; they often dry themselves on the animal’s hair after bathing, especially on cool days when the birds want to get dry quickly! They leave their hosts at dusk to roost in trees.</p><p>Traditional nesting sites are tree holes, though shortage of these may force the birds to choose a hole in a wall. One observer found Red-billed Oxpeckers feeding two chicks in a hole in a Euphorbia tree 5 km from Pilanesberg Game Reserve (possibly a bit closer as the oxpecker flies). One day a free-range cow happened along and the oxpeckers spent all day gathering ticks from it and intermittently ferrying them to the nest to feed the chicks. Presumably the beast had not been dipped recently, because neither the adults nor the chicks showed any subsequent signs of sickness. One of the chicks was overenthusiastic about food delivery and fell out of the nest up to three times a day.  The parents always flew down to show it how to scramble, woodpecker-like, back up the trunk, which it quickly learnt to do. Both young birds fledged successfully after three weeks and were not seen again.</p><p>Margaret Maciver, the perceptive observer, wondered how the oxpeckers had found the hole in a tree so far from their usual daytime haunts. Holes in trees are not permanent, and they may constitute a scarce resource for these birds, whose food supplies are limited only by the availability of favoured host ungulates that tolerate their presence.</p>",

From the 1960s there was an international campaign to reduce quelea numbers, with aerial spraying of flocks and roost sites, and ground teams with flame-throwers destroying breeding colonies. However, after 25 years the birds were as abundant as before, while toxic sprays had killed other species and contaminated aquatic systems. Currently only flocks directly threatening crops are destroyed.</p><p>Originally birds of semi-arid regions, queleas have adapted to take advantage of temporarily favourable conditions by rapid, highly synchronised breeding and extensive movements related to food availability. Within South Africa, their range has recently expanded to grain-growing areas in the south and south-west. The main natural food is small grass seeds, but they also take rice and wheat, and at feedlots crushed maize provided to ostriches and other stock is often precisely the size favoured by queleas. Breeding colonies also consume huge numbers of insects, while the nestlings in turn provide food for predators ranging from large mammalian carnivores (leopard), raptors and storks, to carnivorous insects. Flocks drinking on the wing result in some birds being forced down into the water, where crocodiles and turtles lie in wait, while herons and storks spear stragglers along the shoreline.

Falcons dive at circling flocks to separate off individuals.</p><p>Female Red-billed Queleas in breeding condition have yellow bills. Breeding males acquire distinctive face masks – most often black with either a pink or whitish surround, or more rarely a white mask with a pink surround. Nests are constructed rapidly: oval balls of grass strips with a side entrance, sometimes under a short porch, usually in thorn trees, particularly hook-thorn trees, sometimes in reeds or tall grasses. The territory is restricted to the actual nest, with thousands of nests often clustered in a single tree. One colony contained an estimated 31 million nests! Breeding is tightly synchronised within a colony, which may be deserted within 40 days of first nest construction. Both parents incubate, although the male only sits for short periods, and both feed the young. The mating system appears monogamous, but ‘serial polygamy’ may occur over a season, with individuals breeding successively at different locations, and both males and females forming new pair bonds each time. Young birds emerge from the nest before they can fly, and perch in the branches of the trees. Both nestlings and adults are harvested for food in some rural communities. Quelea colonies in the Kruger National Park attracted more than 1&#160;000 Lesser Spotted Eagles, with eight nestlings per eagle a day’s ration.</p><p>Flocks of Red-billed Queleas show close co-ordination of their flight manoeuvres, and huge dry season roosts may contain millions of birds.  They also roost with other weaver species, or with Barn Swallows.  Small groups of queleas (&lt; 100 birds) often flock with other seedeaters, especially bishops.Early models suggested a regular pattern of quelea migration, associated with rain fronts in different regions. However, in southern Africa movements are mostly over short distances, with some populations essentially sedentary. During intensive ringing in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, of 92 birds recaptured or recovered (found dead) only one was &gt; 50 km from the ringing site. However, a few birds ringed in the Free State and North West provinces over the same period moved to Zimbabwe, Namibia and the southern Democratic Republic of Congo, up to 2&#160;200 km away.</p><p>Natural mortality is likely to be high, and with &gt; 135 000 Red-billed Queleas ringed the oldest bird from South Africa was recovered after 7 years 10 months.</p>",

But not all the tails are the same. The flufftails are a distinct group of eight species from the cosmopolitan crakes and rails family which has a total tally of about 160 species. Three features set them apart from the rest of the family. Firstly, there are obvious differences in the plumages of males and females; secondly, they all lay plain white eggs while most others lay spotted eggs; and thirdly, many have deep-toned hooting calls. They all have the reputation of being very difficult to see.</p><p>Red-chested Flufftails are nevertheless common birds distributed throughout the wetter parts of southern Africa, central Africa and the coastal regions on the bulge of West Africa. They are primarily birds of permanently wet ground carrying a robust growth of rushes, sedges, reeds and related plants. They do venture out into the fringes of seasonally wet land where there is cover from above but they do not walk about in the open.</p><p>Red-chested Flufftails are nevertheless common birds distributed throughout the wetter parts of southern Africa, central Africa and the coastal regions on the bulge of West Africa. They are primarily birds of permanently wet ground carrying a robust growth of rushes, sedges, reeds and related plants. They do venture out into the fringes of seasonally wet land where there is cover from above but they do not walk about in the open.</p><p>The great strides in our knowledge of these birds taken in recent years are largely attributable to the work of Barry Taylor, now based in KwaZulu-Natal, who has been responsible for most modern writings on this family as in Roberts VII, the Handbook of Birds of the World, and his own monograph ‘Rails’ which covers all the crakes, rails, coots and related species of the world. The progress in the study of flufftails has been greatly enhanced by keeping various species in captivity. The wet conditions which they occupy in the wild contain an abundance of food, cover and other amenities of life concentrated into very small areas which can easily be replicated in an aviary, and several species have been quick to breed in captivity.</p><p>The best and most rewarding way to catch up with many of these birds is to walk in the wetlands with a well-trained dog. Dogs bring another dimension altogether to birding. They quickly add to sightings, to an understanding of which birds like which habitats, and to finding nests on which further studies can be centred. There is something aristocratic about the way a Pointer works but the pure breeds run too far and too fast for craking. A Pointer cross Labrador is more manageable but needs to be trained with another experienced dog. Dogs require a lot of exercise and attention, and they must be restrained from pouncing instead of just pointing.</p><p>All the flufftails have extensive repertoires of calls because communication by sound is better than that by sight in their densely vegetated homes. Red-chested Flufftails do not have a repetitious deep hoot like some other flufftails but they do have deep gulps and glugs which often introduce both of their most recognisable signature tunes. The ‘song’ is a prolonged series of ‘woo, woo, woo, woo’ notes which can be repeated for minutes on end and often well into the night. Those notes are of much the same volume, pitch and quality as the clear notes uttered by boubou shrikes. But each note is much shorter and is followed by the next, the next and the next note, much more quickly than you get in the leisurely calls of a boubou. The other common call of the Red-chested is termed a territorial call often represented as ‘dueh, dueh, dueh…’ This is very different and a lot livelier than the monotonous ‘song’. It is uttered in short bursts of two-syllabled notes, quickly repeated and lasting only about six seconds per series.</p>",

In fact, the latest molecular information now indicates that this species is a long-tailed bishop, rather than a member of the widowbird group. In captivity Red-collared Widowbirds have hybridised with both bishops and widowbirds.</p><p>During the non-breeding season Red-collared Widowbirds join large flocks and roosts of bishops and widowbirds, feeding mainly on seeds, but also taking nectar from aloes, and catching insects when they can. Seasonal changes in the sex ratio at these roost sites indicate that some local movements must occur, although only one ringed bird was found to have moved more than 100 km. The oldest ringed birds to date are at least eight years old.</p><p>During the non-breeding season Red-collared Widowbirds join large flocks and roosts of bishops and widowbirds, feeding mainly on seeds, but also taking nectar from aloes, and catching insects when they can.

The oldest ringed birds to date are at least eight years old.</p><p>The red collar seems to be an important signal in territorial interactions, and males with larger red collars hold larger territories. However, for female Red-collared Widowbirds, the tail length of male birds seemed to be their most important attri&#173;bute, based on experimental work in KwaZulu-Natal. Male birds perform short flight displays, with the tail feathers expanded but trailing out behind the body. These flights often consist mainly of gliding downhill from one high perch to another, accompanied by a chittering call. In the perched display, the male puffs out his breast so that the red collar is more conspicuous, and produces a harsh sizzling song. Territories are large and may contain up to 22 nest frames. The male constructs a very basic nest frame, either low in a grass tuft or supported at the sides by tall grass stems and then more than one metre above the ground. This frame is woven from strips of grass, with living grass forming a bower over the top, and the entrance at the side. The female then converts this to a much more substantial structure, adding a dense lining of grass stems, often continuing to add material after the eggs have been laid. The start of nesting depends on the state of grass growth following the rains, and nests later in the season, when the grass is longer and denser, are often more successful, with early nests suffering higher predation.</p><p>As in other polygynous members of the weaver family, the female does all the incubation and feeding of the nestlings. In a study in KwaZulu-Natal, up to 70% of the nests were lost to predation each year, with rodents and snakes the main culprits. The Red-collared Widowbird is an occasional host of the Dideric Cuckoo, but it is never as heavily parasitised as are colonial species. Old nests are often used for breeding by Orange-breasted Waxbills in South Africa.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a bird of the dry west which, like many arid-country birds, appears to move extensively. One ringed Red-headed Finch moved some 200 km from its capture site. At times, non-breeding birds irrupt well outside their usual range, when they may even occur in urban habitats. Flocks out of the breeding season may number several hundred individuals, and they then associate with other small seed-eating birds, both when feeding and when visiting drinking sites. The red wash on the head and the scalloped patterning of the feathers are distinctive in the male, while the female can be distinguished from the similar Cut-throat Finch by her plain upperparts (barred in Cut-throat Finches). Compared to other waxbills, it is a large, heavy-billed bird, more like a sparrow, as suggested by the alternative Afrikaans name ‘Rooikopmossie’.</p><p>Courting males adopt an upright posture, facing the female, with the feathers of the throat, breast and belly puffed out. This display is accompanied by the buzzing, churring song. When breeding, Red-headed Finches are monogamous and often nest as isolated pairs, although they may be clustered together in an almost colonial situation when they occupy chambers in a Sociable Weaver nest, or neighbouring nests of other colonial weavers. Their nest is a ball of dry grass with a side entrance, which may be placed in a tree hole or even a gap in the wall of a building, but most frequently is inside the nest of another species.</p><p>Courting males adopt an upright posture, facing the female, with the feathers of the throat, breast and belly puffed out.

In captivity Red-headed Finches are known to take over the nests of many other species, actively evicting the occupants. Under natural conditions, this appears to occur regularly only in the case of Chestnut Weavers, but it has been seen once in a Sociable Weaver nest. At some Chestnut Weaver colonies in Namibia, many females abandoned their nests, even those with eggs in them, when groups of Red-headed Finches arrived, immediately occupying the newly-vacated nests and laying their own eggs. Although in some cases the weaver eggs still hatched, the young weavers were apparently not fed by the finches, and all died within a few days. It is notable that the breeding season of the Red-headed Finch is typically later than the weavers whose nests it may occupy. In both Africa and Asia there are numerous records of some members of the waxbill family utilising old weaver nests. Since these nests usually persist for some months after construction, and provide a well-built shell within which other birds can nest, it is in fact surprising that so few species have taken advantage of this form of ‘nest parasitism’. Red-headed Finches line their nests with soft plant material and feathers, and the male may continue to bring feathers to the nest during the incubation period. Both male and female take part in incubation, and both sexes feed the young.</p>",

Red-headed Queleas are uncommon on the coastal plain of Mozambique, but only occasional in the Zambezi Region and along the Zambezi River. In non-breeding plumage they are easily overlooked in flocks of bishops; at close range the queleas have plainer, unstreaked crowns, and yellowish margins to the primaries. Males with traces of breeding plumage have red extending onto the face and throat, areas that are black in the male Southern Red Bishop.</p><p>Breeding is colonial, with hundreds or thousands of nests at a single site, but the same site is rarely used in successive years. One bird ringed at a breeding colony in South Africa was re-captured at the same site 7 years 9 months later.

These are the nests of the Red-headed Weaver. This species is colonial in the Zimbabwean Lowveld, where I have observed at least four males displaying and building at the same time in a single Baobab Tree.</p><p>It is also a common species of the Miombo Woodlands of the Zimbabwean Highveld and middle altitude woodlands, but here the birds always occur in pairs, not colonies. It appears that the nest tree is the centre of the pair’s territory and nests are at least 150-200 m apart. The males moult into their bright red breeding dress in late July or early August and, as soon as the new leaves appear on the trees – especially the Brachystegia tree species, they start building. The nests are made from the central stems of pinnate leaves which are soft and supple when picked, but which dry out into hard ‘sticks’, hence the common name of ‘Stick Weaver’. The dry nests are very durable and may last several years, especially in drier areas. This enhances the idea that all Red-headed Weavers are colonial, which is not the case.</p><p>It is also a common species of the Miombo Woodlands of the Zimbabwean Highveld and middle altitude woodlands, but here the birds always occur in pairs, not colonies.

The dry nests are very durable and may last several years, especially in drier areas. This enhances the idea that all Red-headed Weavers are colonial, which is not the case.</p><p>The birds build the shell of the nest remarkably quickly – one nest was completed in two days when the trees were in new leaf. The male starts by attaching the first soft leaf ‘shaft’ at or near a fork of a drooping branch – whether by design or chance, the first knot is often a clove hitch which gets tighter each time the male pulls the end. He then constructs a vertical ring followed by the body of the nest. Finally he builds the tunnel entrance. Usually the shell is completed within five days and is checked by the yellow-headed female three or more times each day. Thereafter the nest is lined, and leaves added into the roof. This is presumably for waterproofing, although breeding in Zimbabwe normally occurs before the main summer rains start. It is suggested that the leaves deflect the sun but as the nests are in woodland they are shaded from direct sun. Many males have learnt to attach the nest to telephone and electricity wires, despite these being so slippery. As a result, they have become common breeding garden birds.</p><p>The nest dries out fairly quickly and it is noticeable that the male’s red head gets paler through wear as he enters and leaves the hard dry nest. Unusually for weavers, the male does some incubation, but mostly in shorter shifts than the female; he also helps with feeding of the chicks. The chicks look like the female when they fledge. If the chicks fledge early enough the male may make a second nest, and a second clutch is laid.</p><p>Unlike most of the weavers, which are grain eaters (granivores), Red-headed Weavers are essentially insect eaters (insectivores), although they do eat some soft fruits and seeds. They have a longer, thinner and more pointed bill than most weavers and would find it difficult to crack dry seeds with this bill; but they do eat green grass seeds in summer. They forage for insects from ground level to the top of the tree canopy and, when not breeding, are regular members of bird parties foraging through the woodlands. In the bird parties they are usually silent and because the male no longer has a bright red head, they are easy to overlook. They will clamber up tree trunks and along branches, but most of their insect prey seems to be found among fallen leaves and on small twigs, most often on the ground.</p>",

Major wintering concentrations occur off the west coast of South America between the Equator and 20°S, in the north-west Indian Ocean between the Arabian coast and Kenya, and in the south China Sea. In the last 40 to 50 years small wintering populations have established themselves, and appear to be increasing, at saltworks in southern Africa and Australia, well south of their normal wintering grounds. In our area it is now found regularly at the saltworks in Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and Velddrif, with occasional vagrancy to sites in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Vagrants to inland wetlands are less common than Red Phalaropes.

It appears to be sedentary, as none of 86 ringed birds had moved more than 5 km when re-encountered. The birds feed mainly on the ground in pairs or small parties, and this twinspot has been better studied in aviaries than in the field.  It is often also referred to as ‘Peters’s Twinspot’, as the species was first described by the German zoologist Wilhelm Peters, who collected extensively in Mozambique during the 19th century.</p><p>The male has a complex song of high-pitched notes and trills, whereas the female has a much shorter song. During courtship the male may carry a feather or a grass stalk with its seedhead in his bill, a display which is characteristic of particular groups within the waxbill family. Holding this sample of nest-lining material, he dances around the female, bowing and bobbing with his ventral feathers fluffed out, and singing. The female may also sing in reply, but she is the less active partner.  Red-throated Twinspots are found as isolated, territorial pairs when nesting. There may be a long-term pair bond, as allopreening occurs regularly in captive birds even outside the breeding season.</p><p>The male has a complex song of high-pitched notes and trills, whereas the female has a much shorter song.

This may be related to an absence of grass in the areas they inhabit on the edges of forests and thickets. The nest is a ball-shaped structure with a side entrance, placed almost on the ground or low in the vegetation, and lined with feathers, fine grass and dry moss. In captive birds, during the change-over of incubating birds, the incoming partner often brings a piece of nesting material, and presumably this happens in wild birds also. Both sexes incubate the eggs, though in captive birds the female always seems to take the night shift. Male and female both feed the young in the nest and for up to two weeks after the young birds fledge. On the evidence of song mimicry and matching mouth markings, the Red-throated Twinspot has its own specialist brood parasite, the Zambezi or Twinspot Indigobird Vidua codringtoni. This host-parasite relationship was only identified in the last 30 years, and we have no idea of the impact that parasitism has on wild populations. This species is not currently threatened. Nevertheless, local population declines have been recorded with habitat loss due both to human activities and to the destruction of thickets by large herbivores. Birds are also captured for the cage-bird trade.</p>",

Its Palaearctic counterpart, the Eurasian Wryneck Jynx torquilla (the world’s only other wryneck species), is partly migratory, visiting Africa in the southern summer. These modified woodpeckers resemble other members of the Picidae family in most aspects, including their zygodactyl feet (with two toes pointing forward, and two back) and their exceptionally long, sticky tongues which are used to extract insects from soil or wood. However, they differ from typical woodpeckers in their cryptic plumage, breeding biology and in that their softer tails are not used as supporting props on vertical branches: wrynecks are more often seen perching crosswise on branches.</p><p>Elsewhere within its fragmented African range, the Red-throated Wryneck is known as the Rufous-breasted, Red-breasted or Rufous-necked Wryneck, but all of these names emphasise the same plumage feature – a striking reddish brown patch on the throat and upper breast. From a distance wrynecks appear uniformly mottled grey, and it is only upon closer scrutiny that their intricately barred, blotched and speckled plumage can be fully appreciated. This beautiful nightjar-like attire provides the birds with excellent camouflage on a background of dead wood. In fact, this species is easily overlooked even when perching in an exposed position on a dead snag or telephone pole.</p><p>Elsewhere within its fragmented African range, the Red-throated Wryneck is known as the Rufous-breasted, Red-breasted or Rufous-necked Wryneck, but all of these names emphasise the same plumage feature – a striking reddish brown patch on the throat and upper breast.

This beautiful nightjar-like attire provides the birds with excellent camouflage on a background of dead wood. In fact, this species is easily overlooked even when perching in an exposed position on a dead snag or telephone pole.</p><p>The best way for birders to locate this species is to play it by ear, so to speak. Red-throated Wrynecks proclaim ownership of their 10-20 hectare territories by uttering a quick succession of distinctive nasal, moaning squeaks in a short series, repeated at intervals of a few seconds – ‘queek-queek-queek-queek-queek’. Depending on the context, each series may include up to 12 piercing squeaks loud enough to be heard half a kilometre away. A lower intensity version is used as a contact call between the sexes (when the male’s slightly lower pitched voice is discernible). In social interactions, they also give a raspy chattering and may even tap their bills on branches to produce a soft drumming sound. Outside of the early summer breeding season, wrynecks are mostly silent.</p><p>Population densities of the Red-throated Wryneck vary considerably throughout its range. While it is nowhere abundant, it can be locally common in areas of open grassland dotted with clumps of Protea, Acacia or even alien wattle, gum or willow trees. Provided sufficient open ground is available for foraging, it also frequents farmyards and gardens in rural towns.</p><p>Although usually seen in trees (where it calls and sunbathes, and seeks refuge if disturbed), the Red-throated Wryneck is partly terrestrial, obtaining the majority of its food by hopping about on the ground. Small ants and their larvae, pupae and eggs constitute the single largest dietary component. The bird uses its short, spiky bill to dig up ant nests and its long tongue to extract prey.</p><p>Unlike woodpeckers and barbets, wrynecks do not excavate nest cavities themselves, instead nesting in an existing woodpecker hole and customising the interior with bark chips and, unusually, grass blades. Less frequently pairs may nest in natural tree cavities, nest boxes, old swallow nests or hollow fence posts. Nest cavities may also be used as night-time roosts, although the sexes often roost (and forage) separately.</p><p>If threatened, Red-throated Wrynecks employ an effective and formidable defensive strategy by hissing menacingly and twisting their heads and necks about (even to 180°) in a snake-like fashion. This bizarre neck-writhing explains the origin of the name ‘wryneck’. It has also afforded the bird a position in the realms of magic and witchcraft. Its scientific name, Jynx, is thought to be the origin of the slang phrases of putting a ‘jinx’ on someone or ‘jinxing’ something by talking too confidently about the future.</p><p>&#9;</p>",

At other times of the year, however, they may be less loved, because their fruit-eating habits often land them in trouble. In natural habitats they feed on small berries and drupes such as those of Cape Holly Ilex mitis and White Pear Apodytes dimidiata. In suburban gardens, however, they find all sorts of other delectable fruits on a variety of decorative trees, some of which are not cultivated for the benefit of hungry starlings.</p><p>Most urban Red-winged Starling pairs find enough food during the spring and summer months to feed not only themselves but also three or four ravenous nestlings. They build bulky, open-cup nests of bents and rootlets, bound with mud, and may drop much debris in the construction process if the chosen platform is not level or wide enough. The cup is lined with fine plant material such as dry grass. The female incubates the russet-spotted blue eggs for between two and three weeks. Once the eggs have hatched, both parents feed the nestlings, which fledge in three to four weeks. Up to two broods may be raised each year and, once independent of their parents, the sooty-coloured young gather in flocks and fly out from the roosting site each morning, returning again in the late afternoon before most of the adult birds.</p><p>During April to August (the cool, non-breeding months), most Red-winged Starlings form small flocks which move around foraging during the morning. By mid-morning most of the birds are replete and they gather in a treetop, or on a roof ridge, sunny cliff ledge or a power line (if no other suitably elevated sites are available). Basking in the sun, they communicate with a contented chorus of conversational whistles. Such gatherings may number hundreds of birds, especially when joined by flocks of Common Starlings, and the chorus can be heard at a considerable distance.</p><p>A contact call commonly used by this starling is a descending, three-syllable whistle that sounds like ‘Where-are-you?’ And that is about what it means. This assertion is derived from many years spent in a corner office on the top floor of a large campus building, on the ledges of which Red-winged Starlings competed with Speckled Pigeons for favoured nesting sites. When one member of the starling pair was on the north-facing ledge and could not see its mate a few metres away on the east-facing ledge, it would call continuously, until its mate re-established contact by hopping around the corner towards it.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The most characteristic feature of this species is its distinctive yellow eye-ring. Red-billed Spurfowls are near-endemic to southern Africa, extending marginally into southern Angola and south-western Zambia. They are common in the drier, sandy areas of central and northern Namibia, extreme western Zimbabwe, and throughout central and western Botswana.</p><p>Although they are generally found in dry savannas, they are also common on the floodplains of the Okavango Delta and the Makgadikgadi Pan, where they are often encountered in palm-bordered, woodland glades. Typical open woodland savanna habitats are thornveld, Baikaiea and mixed woodlands, low scrub and thickets interspersed with open ground. They are rarely found far from water. This close association with water means that they disperse or concentrate depending on seasonal rainfall. Their range overlaps quite extensively with Swainson’s Spurfowl and Crested Francolin, and partially with Orange River Francolin. In Namibia, they often occur alongside Hartlaub’s Spurfowl. During the late 1900s their range expanded southwards into southern Botswana and the Northern Cape.</p><p>Although they are generally found in dry savannas, they are also common on the floodplains of the Okavango Delta and the Makgadikgadi Pan, where they are often encountered in palm-bordered, woodland glades.

During the late 1900s their range expanded southwards into southern Botswana and the Northern Cape.</p><p>They are usually encountered as pairs or coveys of up to 12 birds. Quite often, their scratching for food items in the leaf litter under scrubby cover will disclose their presence. Although fairly shy, they can be bold at sites in association with humans, such as camp sites and lodges. They have also been known to venture into smaller rural villages, where they feed with domestic chickens. When disturbed, they either run fast into nearby cover or flush with a harsh alarm call, often seeking a perch to avoid intruders. Characteristic of many animals of the warm tropics, they are most active at dawn and dusk, resting in the shade during the heat of the day. This spurfowl’s raucous call, heard most frequently at dusk and dawn, and often well before daylight, is similar to those of Cape and Natal Spurfowls, their closest relatives, but even more strident.</p><p>They are commonly associated with game, such as elephants, rhinos and buffaloes, particularly at water holes where they can be seen scratching through droppings in search of undigested seeds and invertebrates that seek shelter under the droppings.</p><p>Although, like most spurfowls, bulbs and corms make up a large part of their diet, especially in the dry season, they, like Crested Francolins, make the most of the offerings of the savannas, feeding on fruits, berries and seeds. In the Hwange area of Zimbabwe they have even been seen scrambling about in trees, feeding on fruits.</p><p>Red-billed Spurfowl are solitary nesters and, like other spurfowl, are monogamous. Although they have been recorded breeding in all months of the year, usually following rainfall events, peak breeding takes place during winter and spring (April to September) in Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and during the summer months (November to January) in the Northern Cape. The nest is a scrape in the ground, sparsely lined with dry vegetation and placed among grass tufts or under a bush. Compared to most other spurfowl and francolin nests, it is often poorly concealed. The average clutch of five eggs is incubated for 22 days. Juveniles attain adult plumage at about three months and the male’s spur develops at about five months.</p><p>There are no real concerns regarding the conservation of this widespread and locally common species. Its apparent tolerance of humans and use for human-modified habitats makes it successful across large areas of southern Africa. The only real threat to its security is large-scale habitat degradation, either by clear-felling or overgrazing.</p>",

Most feeding appears to be done early in the morning and in the evening, but feeding can go on throughout the day. They are all usually in their loafing areas about two to three hours after sunrise. They remain there until mid- or late afternoon unless disturbed. In the water they may pick items off the surface or forage with just the bill submerged, or with the head and bill submerged. They will upend in deeper water but seem to do this less often than the Cape Teal. They have been recorded as eating a large variety of vegetation including the seeds of grasses, Polygonum spp., and crop seeds. They also eat a variety of animal food, apparently more so when breeding.</p><p>This species has been extensively studied and many nests examined. They normally breed in response to the filling of temporary pans by rain because the growth of new emergent vegetation provides a food bonanza. They are monogamous breeders. &#173;However, when conditions are right, this species will have pairs nesting all along a shoreline wherever there is sufficient cover to conceal the nests. These may be as close as 10 metres, although this is unusual. At Voëlvlei we found both Red-billed and Cape Teal nesting along the same stretch of shoreline where there was abundant grass cover. The position of nests can often be determined by watching the males waiting just offshore.</p><p>The female does all the nest-building, selecting a depression under grass or similar cover and, while building, she is usually accompanied by the male. The depression is lined with whatever is available but soft grass was the material most often used in the nests I found at Voëlvlei. While these nests were usually within 10-20 metres of the water, in Zimbabwe I have seen nests more than 100 metres from the water because this was the nearest that thick cover was available. Incubation starts once the full clutch of 7-9 eggs is laid, and the female starts adding down once she starts incubating. This, and the grass lining, is used to cover the eggs when the female leaves the nest to join the male to feed. She usually goes off for food in early morning and late afternoon. The male stays with the female until the ducklings are well grown but leaves before they are able to fly.</p>",

Like most vagrant tropicbirds, this individual didn’t hang around, and the birders who rushed to the area failed to connect with the bird. Since then there have been at least three further records, all seen at sea off the west coast north of Cape Town. All records have been in summer (November-April). They may be under-reported because they tend to remain in warm, oceanic waters far offshore.</p><p>Red-billed Tropicbirds occur patchily throughout the tropical oceans, and are absent from the south-western Indian Ocean, so the birds reaching southern Africa presumably come from the small Atlantic Ocean population.

        "Body_Content": "<p>This large, handsome swallow has a leisurely, graceful flight, featuring long glides and comparatively few wingbeats, often feeding at some six metres above open grassland, which is its favoured habitat. Its varied long, whistled calls, gurgles and chatters set it apart from other archetypal swallows such as the Barn and White-throated, which have rather soft, twittering calls, and construct open cup-shaped nests. The Red-breasted Swallow sounds more like the Greater and Lesser Striped Swallows, and like them, it builds an enclosed nest with an entrance tunnel. Like the similar-looking Mosque Swallow and the two striped swallows, these African swallows spend their non-breeding season at lower latitudes in or close to the Equator.</p><p>Red-breasted Swallows start arriving in Zimbabwe from the middle of July, with the majority of those travelling further south arriving in August. Departure takes place in April and early May. There is strong fidelity to breeding site, and nest preparation gets under way soon after the spring arrival of the migrants, each pair refurbishing their old nest, or constructing a new one.</p><p>Red-breasted Swallows start arriving in Zimbabwe from the middle of July, with the majority of those travelling further south arriving in August. Departure takes place in April and early May. There is strong fidelity to breeding site, and nest preparation gets under way soon after the spring arrival of the migrants, each pair refurbishing their old nest, or constructing a new one.</p><p>The natural nest sites used by Red-breasted Swallows are the roofs of Aardvark tunnels, or the underside of the trunk of a fallen tree. Regional reference works also include a ‘hole in bank’ among the natural nest sites, but this repeated and misleading statement has probably resulted from the text length constraints normally placed on compilers. The original reference, in Chapin’s Birds of the Belgian Congo refers to a cave-size excavation gouged by elephants in a clay bank. The Red-breasted Swallow’s nest was attached to the roof. Chapin’s description includes a sketch, so one can get an idea of the scale of the site. He also mentions that the lower surface of the nest had “been rubbed smooth by animal backs.”</p><p>The walls of Red-breasted Swallow nests are thicker than those of the two striped swallows. If a bird habitually attaches its nest to the roofs of animal burrows or excavations, a stronger construction is likely a necessity – an Aardvark, for example, does not dig a tunnel bigger than it needs, and even if it is no longer in residence, its burrow may be appropriated by other animals such as Warthog and Spotted Hyena. So the swallow’s nest needs to be strong enough to withstand the occasional impact of animal passage. Such concerns are now largely moot, however, as there have been no southern African records of natural nest site use for the past half-century. Instead they use concrete pipe culverts under roadways. In Zimbabwe, 29 pairs of Red-breasted Swallows bred along a 19-kilometre stretch of road that boasted 50 culverts. This swallow has expanded its breeding range over the past 60 years, especially in South Africa, and it seems that this is linked to the increasing road network and concomitant availability of pipes for nesting sites.</p><p>Red-breasted Swallows are often double-brooded, with a second clutch being initiated within two to four weeks after the successful fledging of the first brood. Because of their fidelity to their nests, with the same migrants returning to the same nest for two or more seasons, it has been possible to determine survival estimates for breeding adults from the recapture of ringed birds. The oldest birds recorded have only lived five to six years (similar longevities to those estimated for Greater and Lesser Striped Swallows). This is a comparatively short lifespan for an African insectivorous bird, many of which can survive two to three times longer. Nevertheless, the Red-breasted Swallow is evidently a thriving species, so a five-year lifespan is long enough to maintain and increase its numbers.</p>",

However, the main areas of occurrence are in the drier areas and grasslands of South Africa, and the Zimbabwe plateau.   Red-capped Larks prefer open grassland or even burnt grassland or areas with scattered small bushes and shrubs. They also move into cultivated lands which have been recently ploughed or which are being heavily grazed with some type of lay crop.</p><p>These birds vary tremendously in the shade of rufous and the amount of rufous on the breast and back.

On the other hand the subspecies from northern Botswana is dark rufous across the entire back and much of the breast and flanks. The crown is rufous with a white line above the eye and a thin black line through the eye. The birds have rufous on the sides of the breast which can extend almost across the breast in dark subspecies. The back, rump and tail are rufous and the wings are also a brown colour. Apart from the desert subspecies, these larks look like very dark birds when they fly.

They forage on the ground as a loose group, but when disturbed the whole flock flies up and moves some distance before settling on the ground again. When the flock lands, the birds may run quite quickly for some distance before stopping to look back to see what’s caused the disturbance. At other times they are incredibly confiding birds and will feed out in front of one and even approach within ten metres if you are out in the open and standing still.</p><p>This species was a winter visitor to the highveld of Zimbabwe, but in recent years, with the huge amount of clearing of woodlands for cultivation and the fact that there are always open lands available in the area, we have found that at least some of the birds stay through the summer. Nevertheless, the numbers usually rise in winter and if an area of grassland is burnt, this species will appear in the area, often in hundreds, if not thousands, of birds.</p><p>They feed on the ground looking for both seeds and insects, especially harvester termite workers and soldiers, working at dawn and dusk. Although seeds appear to be the most important part of their diet, birds feeding nestlings bring in only insects to the chicks.</p><p>The nest is usually built up against a grass tuft. In farming areas it often faces onto a farm road which the birds use to approach the nest. The nest has a type of ‘apron’ of grass in front of it, which is brought in as part of the nest construction.</p><p>The female lays two or three eggs and does all of the incubation, which takes twelve to fifteen days. At this stage the male brings food to the female on the nest.   The chicks leave the nest after about fourteen to sixteen days. It is interesting that this species is able to build a second nest within three weeks of the first chicks fledging, and will then lay a second clutch of eggs.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This widespread robin-chat is abundant in the coastal belt of KwaZulu-Natal, where it occupies the remaining pocket-sized forest patches and lushly wooded parks, even gracing the suburbs of the many coastal resorts where it is a frequent visitor at birdbaths. It is seen most frequently during the balmy, dry winter months, because at that time its numbers are swelled by an influx of up-country visitors. After the onset of summer rains, however, these winter visitors move back inland to the thornveld of the river valleys, where leaf flush of deciduous shrubs in bushy gullies and dongas provides sufficient cover for the birds to establish breeding territories. This pattern of dry-season movement into evergreen forest habitats that also support resident populations, and wet-season dispersal by the migrants to deciduous cover in wooded savannas, seems to occur throughout the species’ range in sub-Saharan Africa and makes its true status in any one area difficult to determine.</p><p>During the post-breeding moult in autumn and the ensuing dry winter season these birds sing very little, although their plaintive and sometimes monotonous ‘see-saw’ contact call can be heard throughout these months. With the advent of spring rains, however, their flute-like songs, which include masterful mimicry of many other birds’ calls, become a characteristic sound of forest and bushveld. The song is commonly delivered from the concealment of the undergrowth, and on cloudy, humid November days, may continue throughout the daylight hours. Neighbouring territory owners vie with each other, all imitating the same call, such as that of a Crowned Eagle, until one of them changes to a European Bee-eater call, whereupon all the others will start mimicking bee-eaters. Individual bird’s repertoires can comprise over 40 mimicked calls.</p><p>During the post-breeding moult in autumn and the ensuing dry winter season these birds sing very little, although their plaintive and sometimes monotonous ‘see-saw’ contact call can be heard throughout these months.

They are especially active just before dusk, after many other birds have already gone to roost. This is a good time to hunt because ground-dwelling insects and spiders are most active at low light levels. In the Chirinda Forest in eastern Zimbabwe, these robin-chats can be found at army-ant swarms, which act as efficient ‘beaters’ of the leaf litter. Ever on the lookout for choice prey, several will attend an ant swarm throughout the day, though they often seem to spend more time chasing one another than feeding.</p><p>Nest sites vary with breeding habitat. In forests, a hollow stump top is favoured, but in bushveld habitat many nests are placed in cracks and hollows in the earthen walls of gullies. About 5% of nests are built on the ground, very well concealed by grass or herbaceous growth. Nest predators are diverse and numerous, especially in lowland forests, so there is a high failure rate, and replacement nests are commonplace. Most eggs of this robin-chat are highly glossed dark chocolate brown, some are immaculate olive green, and others are olive green, patchily overlaid with brown. Immaculate blue clutches also occur, but these are rare. This is the only robin-chat for which four-egg clutches have been recorded (the normal robin-chat clutch comprises 2-3 eggs).</p><p>The juvenile is mottled brown and buff above and below, with an orange and black tail like the adult.

The call readily lends itself to onomatopoeic word formation in a variety of southern African languages, for example ‘Piet-my-vrou’ in Afrikaans or ‘phezu-kom-kono’ in isiZulu.</p><p>On their arrival from north of the Equator, Red-chested Cuckoos call day and night to establish their breeding territories and attract mates. Although they are vocally conspicuous, they are difficult to see, and this is possibly because they are brood parasites which are mobbed by their host species (mainly robin-chats and thrushes) in whose nests they lay their eggs.</p><p>On their arrival from north of the Equator, Red-chested Cuckoos call day and night to establish their breeding territories and attract mates. Although they are vocally conspicuous, they are difficult to see, and this is possibly because they are brood parasites which are mobbed by their host species (mainly robin-chats and thrushes) in whose nests they lay their eggs.</p><p>This species is a ‘generalist’ brood parasite, with a wide range of hosts. It is regarded as a ‘non-matcher’ since the egg frequently does not closely match the host’s eggs. It is interesting to speculate on why this should be. Many of the infrequent hosts that are parasitised are the result of egg-dumping, where the female cuckoo is ‘caught short’ and simply lays her egg in any available nest – in these instances, there is no selection pressure to develop matching eggs. However, with the major hosts, the robin-chats, the situation is quite different – there must be a strong advantage to the cuckoo to lay matching eggs. A close look at this hypothesis shows it to be true, with an interesting exception. The range of rich colours of Red-chested Cuckoo eggs exactly conforms to the range of typical robin-chat eggs, such as those of the Chorister and other African congenerics. However, the Cape Robin-Chat, which is the most common host, uncharacteristically has white eggs spotted with pink! A possible explanation for this anomaly is that the Cape Robin-Chat may be a fairly recent host of the Red-chested Cuckoo – it has been estimated that achieving a match with a new host’s eggs can take as much as 600 years.</p><p>Potential host species clearly recognise the adult cuckoos as a threat and make it difficult for them to access their nests. However, the female cuckoo is often able to sneak in unseen, and has been recorded removing one of the host’s eggs and laying a single one of its own, in less than five seconds! There may also be a second strategy at play here – it is well known that the Red-chested Cuckoo in flight resembles a small sparrowhawk, and it has been hypothesised that this serves to prevent the cuckoo being mobbed by the hosts. Experiments have shown that the barring on the chest is important in this regard. The sudden appearance of a ‘hawk’ may be one of the best ways of frightening the host off its nest or out of the area for long enough for the cuckoo to lay its single egg.</p><p>The sight of a little Cape Wagtail or Robin-Chat slaving away diligently feeding a huge cuckoo chick makes us wonder why it cannot see how different the chick is. The cuckoo chick seems to have evolved in such a way that its appearance and behaviour overstimulate the host’s reaction, making it irresistible. So enticing is the open gape of a cuckoo nestling that, in some cuckoo species, there are records of other unrelated birds (in addition to the foster parents) also feeding them. A bird may be flying home, carrying food for its own young, when it sees the large super-gape of a young cuckoo – it is diverted to the chick where it drops into the cuckoo’s mouth the food that had been destined for its own young!</p><p>From the above, it can be seen that the Red-chested Cuckoo has one of the most fascinating – if not outright bizarre – life histories of any bird. Proof, once again, that ‘the truth is stranger than fiction’.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Red-crested Bustard is a poorly named bird. Most birders will wait a lifetime but never get even a glimpse of the fabled ornament from which the species derives its name, despite spotting hundreds of these birds. The crest, present only in males, is normally hidden below the plain grey feathers of the crown. It is erected, crowned-crane-like, only during the peak frenzy of courtship, which these shy birds only rarely share with the casual human observer.</p><p>The plumage of the male differs in other ways from that of the female. His foreneck is also plain grey, whereas both crown and foreneck are mottled brown in the female, and he has two distinct white panels on either side of his upper chest, while the female shows a uniform white band across this entire area. Both sexes, though, show the diagnostic chevron-shaped markings on the upperparts. An observer should pay attention to the nitty-gritty of such distinguishing features in small bustards, which, to a surprising degree, are regularly confused with one another. Particular care must be taken not to confuse Red-crested Bustards with the females of the Northern Black Bustard.</p><p>The plumage of the male differs in other ways from that of the female.

An observer should pay attention to the nitty-gritty of such distinguishing features in small bustards, which, to a surprising degree, are regularly confused with one another. Particular care must be taken not to confuse Red-crested Bustards with the females of the Northern Black Bustard.</p><p>In many ways the taxonomic position of the Red-crested Bustard was once similar to that of the White-bellied Bustard currently. The Red-crested was originally seen as a widespread African species with three subspecies, one each in southern, East and West Africa. These three races are all now considered separate species, rendering our form as a virtual southern African endemic.</p><p>As reflected in the Afrikaans name, this is the most woodland associated of the southern African bustards, although in the southern Kalahari it inhabits virtually treeless grassy dune fields. There is little evidence for any migratory movements in this bustard, and it seems sedentary in its habits.</p><p>This species does not form permanent pair bonds and the male takes no part in parental activities. As a result, it has an arresting aerial display, prompted also by the closed nature of its habitat, and is highly vocal throughout the breeding season, both features presumably designed to attract as many females as possible. In the aerial display he rises vertically above the canopy layer and then suddenly stalls as if hitting an invisible ceiling and tumbles as precipitously back to earth. No matter how many times you see it, it still elicits a ‘what-on-earth-was-that?’ reaction.</p><p>The call has the same striking impact on the ear as the aerial display has on the eye. It starts off as a slowly accelerating series of ventriloquial clicks that imperceptibly evolve into an endless series of piping notes that increase in volume and pace to an ear-splitting crescendo before falling away again. It is often quite simply the dominant sound of many southern Africa woodlands throughout the spring and early summer. As I once learnt the hard way, the male also sometimes utters a series of ‘wuka-wuka-wuka’ notes that can easily be confused with the call of the Yellow-billed Hornbill.</p><p>My most haunting memory of this species stems from when a colleague and I were surveying raptors in the Springbokpan area of what is now Limpopo Province. We flushed a Red-crested Bustard and as it flew off a pair of Pale Chanting Goshawks hunting in tandem opportunistically pursued and tackled it on the wing. The mortally injured bustard fell to earth and we were able to pick it up still alive, with the two raptors waiting impatiently perched on nearby trees. I remember being struck by the intricate beauty of its vermiculated plumage and the glistening brown delicacy of its eyes. And I still feel the pang of remorse when we placed it back on the ground, walked away and abandoned it to its fate.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>A familiar garden bird in most of its southern African range, the Red-eyed Dove has a high tolerance of habitat transformation, and indeed seems to have benefited from land-use changes. The species is widespread in Africa south of the Sahel. In southern Africa, these birds are found mainly in the north-east, east and south, avoiding the arid parts of Namibia south of Ovamboland, the Kalahari Basin and the western Karoo. Over the last century the species’ range in southern Africa has expanded, especially in Gauteng, Lesotho, parts of the Free State, the southern Karoo and Western Cape. The availability of surface water, croplands and gardens all seem to have played a role in this range expansion.</p><p>The birds occur naturally in well-developed woodlands, and riverine and gallery forests, but now also make use of alien plantations and thickets. In the Western Cape they are more frequent in eucalyptus and pine plantations than in thickets of Rooikrans Acacia cyclops and Port Jackson Willow A. saligna. In Zimbabwe, their use of pine plantations has allowed them to move into higher elevations than before. Red-eyed Doves, in common with most other dove species, drink water regularly, and thus the provision of surface water, mainly for domestic livestock, has allowed the spread of birds into areas that were formerly too arid.</p><p>The birds occur naturally in well-developed woodlands, and riverine and gallery forests, but now also make use of alien plantations and thickets.

Red-eyed Doves, in common with most other dove species, drink water regularly, and thus the provision of surface water, mainly for domestic livestock, has allowed the spread of birds into areas that were formerly too arid.</p><p>Red-eyed Doves forage on the ground, frequently under trees, often where there is leaf litter. Their food is mainly the dry seeds of grasses and trees, and some small, juicy fruits. Few of the seeds eaten and identified are of native plants – most are of cereal crops such as maize, millet, sorghum, cowpeas and sunflowers. They also eat groundnuts (Arachis species), and seeds of the alien Castor Oil Bush Ricinus communis, crotons or fever berries (Croton species), Rooikrans and other alien Acacias. Despite eating a wide range of crop seeds, Red-eyed Doves are not considered agricultural problem birds because most of the seeds they eat have fallen from the plants or are spillage from grain carriers. By contrast to the seed components of their diet, most of the fruits that they eat are of native plants. These include the small fruits of Pigeonwood Trema orientalis, White Ironwood Vepris lanceolata and silky barks (Maytenus species), as well as the fruits of some alien trees, including Belhambra Phytolacca octandra, Cherry-pie Lantana camara and Mulberry Morus alba. Red-eyed Doves can swallow large food items such as whole groundnuts complete with shell, and Fever-berry Croton megalobotrys seeds.</p><p>Red-eyed Doves are monogamous and mate for life. They are solitary nesters, with territories defended by the males. Courtship display follows a similar pattern to other doves and pigeons, with a steep upward flight and glide at a low angle, sometimes with wingflaps. The nest is built by the female, using materials brought by the male. It is a fairly substantial platform of twigs, sometimes with leaves attached, with a shallow central depression that may be lined with grass or other fine materials. The nest is usually placed on a horizontal fork, 3-4 metres above ground. Disused nests of other bird species, including crows, thrushes and egrets, are regularly used. Both sexes incubate and feed the nestlings.&#9;</p>",

It is a musical ‘tree-ree-ree’, most often given in flight, and has been likened by some to the call of the Common Greenshank, although perhaps a good imagination is required to hear the resemblance. This bird has a wide distribution, from Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola to the southern coast of South Africa. In southern Africa it only avoids the high-lying grassy Drakensberg and much of the arid Namib Desert in Namibia, but it does penetrate the desert where it can follow the tree-lined dry riverbeds.</p><p>This mousebird is most often associated with tall bushes and trees, and the planting of alien trees around farmsteads in bleak landscapes must have allowed it to expand its range into the semi-arid interior.

On Red Stone Hills farms near Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo it is at times the dominant bird, descending on the orchards and vineyards in large numbers, much to the despair of the local farmers. It is a resident but with nomadic tendencies in response to available fruit and, in arid areas, water. (It needs to drink regularly). Unlike most birds, the mousebirds can suck water into the mouth so the Red-faced Mousebird does not need to spend long at the water’s edge where it is exposed to avian predators. It is usually found in groups of 5–10 birds but where food is abundant, parties of up to 40 have been observed.</p><p>In common with the other local mousebirds, the Speckled and the White-backed, it is a frequent dust-bather, and it also shares with them the regular habit of sunbathing, and regardless of the prevailing temperature, the tendency to sleep in clusters.</p><p>The nest is built by both sexes, occasionally assisted by a helper. It is an untidy basin-shaped structure usually placed about 3 m above the ground (exceptionally up to 8 m) in a thickly foliaged tree or large bush. The Mediterranean Cypress Cupressus sempervirens, often planted in graveyards,is a favourite choice. For many years Red-faced Mousebirds have bred in the alien Pin Oaks Quercus palustris that line the busy main street of Somerset West, where they tolerate the constant roar of passing vehicles and hordes of pedestrians. Unlike the nests of other mousebird species, the base of the nest is constructed of dry twigs and it is not lined with green leaves. Sheep’s wool is sometimes used for lining when this is available. At a nest found near Three Sisters in the central Great Karoo, lining was still being added to the nest after incubation had started. It usually nests solitarily but sometimes several nests are located less than 30 metres apart. Breeding has been noted in all months but in the south-western Western Cape there is a distinct peak in spring and early summer.</p><p>What is the origin of the name ‘mousebird’?   Several bird books state that the mouse-like manner in which it creeps through the vegetation has given rise to the name. Perhaps, but one wonders if the fur-like feathers on the breast and belly, so reminiscent of a small rodent’s coat, prompted the original name?</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Red-fronted Tinkerbird (which used to be called a Tinker Barbet because of its pinging call which sounds like a tinker hitting an anvil) is a bird which is found along the KwaZulu-Natal coastal areas from Swaziland south to somewhere near Port Elizabeth. The first Red-fronted Tinkerbird I ever saw had a yellow front, which caused considerable confusion because I was well south of the known distribution of the Yellow-fronted Tinkerbird. However, experience has shown that birds with red feathers may often have the red as an orange or yellow colour.</p><p>These small birds are very easy to overlook unless they are calling. Although the calls of the tinkerbirds are very similar, the speed varies, and in fact the Red- and Yellow-fronted birds do not overlap so there can be no confusion here. The birds will sit and call in the canopy without moving at all and are, therefore, quite difficult to locate because the call has a ventriloquial effect. The birds are recorded as giving about 120 metallic pings a minute, and this may continue for some minutes at a time.</p><p>These small birds are very easy to overlook unless they are calling.

The birds are recorded as giving about 120 metallic pings a minute, and this may continue for some minutes at a time.</p><p>Although the Red-fronted Tinkerbird is usually recorded in pairs or family parties, it will readily join the mixed-species bird parties which forage through the woodland where it lives. When joining these parties the birds may be found at almost any level in the woodland but are often recorded lower down the trees than some of the other bird party species. It is interesting that this species has a rather heavier and more pyramidal-shaped bill than the yellow-fronted species, and has been recorded as hammering at wood to get at insects. The birds do not normally feed like woodpeckers by digging in dead wood, but the bill is strong enough to excavate the nest hole in a piece of dead wood. The nest entrance is small –  about the size of a R5 coin – but the nest inside the branch is considerably wider – up to 75mm, especially at the bottom. The bird normally lays three pure white, elliptical eggs which hatch after approximately 14 days.</p><p>While insects are an important part of their diet, these birds make extensive use of fruit and also feed in a variety of fruiting trees. The tinkerbirds eat all those fig species which bear fruit less than 15 mm in diameter. While figs, like the Natal Fig Ficus natalensis, which produces small, round fruit 5–10 mm in size, are particularly favoured by this species, they will eat any fruit which occurs in their woodland. It is interesting watching one of these small birds trying to repel others of the same species coming to an enormous fig tree to eat. The fact that there is so much food that not even a flock of Red-fronted Tinkerbirds could possibly consume all the figs does not seem to make any difference.</p><p>The tinkerbirds are very important for the dispersal of the seeds of the mistletoespecies. These parasitic plants flower in autumn and winter, producing fruit when most other trees do not have fruit. The birds come to feed on these ‘bushes’ hanging in the tree. They pop the skin to get the flesh, which is swallowed and the seed then regurgitated¸ but because the seed is sticky, it often adheres to the bird’s bill. The bird may then fly off and wipe its bill on another branch or tree, leaving the seed stuck to the tree. There it germinates and its roots penetrate the living branch of the host tree. The tree sometimes becomes so infested with the mistletoe that it may even cause the tree to die.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The saying ‘as daft as a coot’ may be something of an oxymoron for these adaptable and successful waterbirds. A quick search of the ‘oracle’ – the internet – to find the origin of this expression was revealing. It apparently refers to the coot’s ‘funny’ walk, reluctance to fly and not very impressive diving ability! Does this add up to a daft bird, or is it a reflection of the worthlessness of attributing human values to animal behaviour and appearances? On one website, a redeeming (though seemingly unlikely) feature for the bird was found: “The coot is not as daft as people might think – it can recognise and count its eggs”! The coot is thus not just another nameless, faceless bird species – it is part of our language and culture. Many people have a rather jaundiced view of it, so let’s put the record straight.</p><p>There are 11 coot species worldwide, only one of which – the Red-knobbed Coot – occurs in southern Africa. It is widely distributed except in low rainfall areas lacking open water, and is the most numerous and frequently reported rallid in our region. Numbers at individual wetlands vary tremendously, with up to 27&#160;000 reported from Barberspan and 30&#160;000 from De Hoop Vlei at various times. The wide fluctuation in numbers is due to their being nomadic, and they opportunistically move short distances (&lt;200 kilometres) in response to rainfall. This enables them to quickly colonise new water bodies, as evidenced by recent range expansions to include artificial impoundments in the Western Cape and parts of Zimbabwe. Quite inexplicably, the Red-knobbed Coot is almost entirely absent from the Okavango Delta, although it breeds prolifically at nearby Lake Ngami.</p><p>There are 11 coot species worldwide, only one of which – the Red-knobbed Coot – occurs in southern Africa.

Quite inexplicably, the Red-knobbed Coot is almost entirely absent from the Okavango Delta, although it breeds prolifically at nearby Lake Ngami.</p><p>The Red-knobbed Coot has a catholic diet, and this also contributes to its wide habitat tolerance and distribution. It eats mainly aquatic plants, but derives most of its energy and nutrients from the small animals living on these plants. It also takes aquatic invertebrates and has even been recorded feeding on carrion (a dead flamingo). Coots spend most of their time swimming and feeding in open water, but when emerging to loaf on mudflats, they indeed exhibit their ‘funny walk’. This is probably due to the long, lobed toes, and the legs being situated far back on the body, both effective adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, but which are less useful on land. The birds are often seen running, flapping and splashing along the water’s surface, without taking off, and this may be construed to be a reluctance to fly. However, it is more likely that this is an aggressive display to conspecifics, and may be a territorial advertisement performed in the vicinity of the nest during breeding.</p><p>The coot has an extraordinary breeding system. The process starts fairly normally with courtship and pair formation. The pair of red knobs on top of the white frontal shield in both sexes swells, becoming conspicuous. During construction of the floating nest, the pair may be assisted by helpers, but this is not always the case, so the coot is classed as a facultative co-operative breeder. The helpers, which are usually young from a previous brood, also co-operate during chick rearing – they benefit indirectly from this arrangement since they share their parents’ genetic make-up and that of the new brood. Quite unusually, coots often suffer high levels of brood parasitism by conspecifics, where egg-dumping in other coots’ nests takes place. This has negative consequences for the perpetuation of the host’s genes, and so evolution has favoured individuals that can count and recognise their own eggs and offspring. Thus coots are not as daft as one might think.</p>",

Here they form part of a trio of raptors which regularly hunt the thousands of granivorous birds – mainly doves, sandgrouse and a variety of sparrows and finches – that come daily to drink at a network of artificial water points. Flocks of finches or doves usually stage in Camelthorn trees around the water holes before plucking up the courage to come down to water. These flocks are periodically targeted by Gabar Goshawks Melierax gabar – that force them out of the trees and into the open, and Lanner Falcons Falco biarmicus – that drive them from the open back into the trees.

Unlike their bigger cousins, they are not built for high flying and vertical diving, but somehow Red-necks seem able to generate velocity on the flat. Pairs typically arrive together on a waterhole raid, in a sinuous, high-velocity blur, weaving between the thorn trees in a confusing rush of grey and white. On one particularly memorable occasion, I watched a strike such as this by a Red-neck pair, from my vehicle, parked next to the Kwang waterhole, north of Nossob camp. Unusually, the falcons had focused on the drinking area itself, and a flock of hundreds of Red-headed Finches Amadina erythrocephala had burst away from the reservoir directly towards me. The terror was plain to see in their beady little eyes, as they poured just over the surface of the windshield, hugging the contours of the vehicle in their desperate bid to escape!</p><p>The Red-necked Falcon is not common anywhere, but possibly achieves its highest breeding densities in the moist palm savanna areas of northern Botswana. It is generally sedentary, with monogamous pairs defending breeding territories year-round, although it has shown an ability to temporarily colonise and breed in areas outside of its normal breeding distribution when conditions are particularly favourable. It feeds on birds – usually small passerines, but up to the size of Streptopelia doves or sandgrouse, and rodents, and will take prey both aerially and on the ground. It breeds in the usurped or disused nests of other species – mainly crows – or in depressions between the fronds of Hyphaene or Borassus palms. Up to four eggs are laid in late winter or spring, and most young fledge in early to midsummer.</p>",

There is also a separate population, of the nominate race, in the Kunene River valley of northern Namibia.</p><p>They are usually secretive, skulking in dense cover and moist habitats, often on the edges of forests or in riparian thickets and marsh edges. Occasionally, they feed in nearby cultivated land, where they may be seen together with Swainson’s Spurfowl in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Zimbabwe. Although mostly uncommon, they are fairly common in the highlands of eastern Zimbabwe, and in the thornveld and montane forests of the Eastern Cape. The lucky birder will come upon them feeding or dust-bathing in an opening or on the edge of a track.</p><p>Red-necked Spurfowl are most often encountered in pairs or small coveys of up to six birds. They are reluctant to flush, preferring to run into dense cover when disturbed, but when they do flush, they fly fast and will often perch in a tree. The call is a harsh ‘krr krr krr korWA, korWA, korWA’, usually given at dawn and dusk; although very similar to the call of Swainson’s Spurfowl, it is more regular in volume.</p><p>The diet consists mostly of small tubers, bulbs, roots, seeds, fruits and other vegetable matter during winter, and insects, termites and molluscs such as snails during summer. They will also take waste farming grains such as maize, sorghum and cereals.</p><p>Breeding in Zimbabwe and northern South Africa is during late summer (January and March), while further south it is earlier (November to January). The nest, lined with grass and feathers, is constructed by the female, and is often placed in dense grass at the base of a tree or bush. The clutch of 3-7 eggs is incubated by the female for 23 days, while the male fiercely guards the nest. Chicks can fly at 10 days and are almost fully grown at 3-4 months. Males do not assist with care of their offspring.</p><p>Red-necked Spurfowls are vulnerable to habitat modification and fragmentation, in particular the destruction of forest and woodland edges by burning and cultivation. Although local variations in population size are mostly in response to forest edge and general habitat changes, this species also responds to droughts by moving from a dry to moister areas. Historical accounts highlight the disappearance of this species from the western limits of its range in the Western Cape, where it was once abundant at least as far west as Wellington and Swellendam. Today, they persist only in the safety of a nature reserve at Grootvadersbos. The present-day distribution of the species is patchy, especially in the Eastern Cape, where it may have suffered local extinctions. In the Zimbabwe highlands, numbers have decreased due to clearing of suitable habitat for agriculture. In these cleared areas, Red-necked Spurfowls have been replaced by Swainson’s Spurfowls.</p>",

However, vagrants tend to occur more commonly at inland wetlands than its smaller relative. In non-breeding plumage it is best distinguished from the Red-necked Phalarope by its more uniform upperparts. At close range its broad, spade-like bill is diagnostic.

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the largest southern African francolin. It is similar to Shelley’s and Orange River Francolins, but has more red on its wings. In southern Africa, Red-winged Francolins are found in the highlands of Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern Free State and the Eastern Cape, with patchy populations as far south as Grootvadersbos, near Swellendam in the Western Cape. They thrive in rank habitats, usually on deeper soils and at lower altitudes than Grey-winged Francolins along the Drakensberg escarpment. In the western parts of their range they inhabit open, rocky, montane grasslands, generally in wetter conditions than those preferred by Orange River Francolin. They are more sensitive to burning and grazing of grasslands than other grassland francolins. In heavily grazed and frequently burnt grasslands, they are restricted to wetland fringes and rocky outcrops. In high-quality habitat, by contrast, and particularly in protected areas, they use more of the available area and occur in larger coveys. Here, home ranges extend over 7-14 hectares and are non-overlapping.</p><p>Small coveys of 4-8 birds are rarely flushed without the aid of pointing dogs, but are commonly heard calling from hilltops early on misty mornings and sometimes at dusk. When they do flush, it is usually at one’s feet, exploding from the grass with a flurry of wings. The escape flight normally ends in a long glide before the bird drops into dense cover, seldom to flush again. If flushed more than once, they then tend to sit so tight that one could pick them up from under the grass. In these instances, they will dig like a rodent in the grass to attempt escape, and have even been known to enter subterranean water channels in this way. The distinctive high-pitched whistling call is rendered as ‘chee-chee-chee-chee kla-CHEE-choo’, accelerating into repeated ‘klik-a-chee-choo, klik-a-chee-choo’ phrases.</p><p>Small coveys of 4-8 birds are rarely flushed without the aid of pointing dogs, but are commonly heard calling from hilltops early on misty mornings and sometimes at dusk.

Unlike Grey-winged Francolins, which feed more selectively on smaller, highly nutritious corms and bulbs, especially of sedges, Red-winged Francolins feed on larger, relatively nutrient-poor iris and lily bulbs. Their heavy bills are effective digging tools for excavating large bulbs and corms, even from near-frozen soil. Like other francolins, their diet is supplemented with insects during summer.</p><p>Peak breeding is during midsummer in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga, following early summer rains, and during October in the Western Cape. Nests are often placed close to wetland edges within two- to three-year-old grass, where cover and insects are plentiful. The nest is a shallow scrape between grass tufts lined with live and dead grass. The clutch of 5-8 eggs is incubated by the female for 22 days. Hatching success is usually above 80%, but nestling survival over the first four weeks of life can be as low as 36%. The hatchlings are precocial and are cared for by both parents.</p><p>A healthy Red-winged Francolin population is a strong indicator of healthy highland grassland, which itself is a threatened habitat, particularly sensitive to even moderate overgrazing and the injudicious use of fire: Red-winged Francolins are particularly sensitive to annual burning. Other major threats to these grasslands are expanding forestry, and the damming and draining of wetlands. There are numerous examples in southern Africa both of local decreases in numbers of Red-winged Francolins and of areas where they are absent from apparently suitable habitat. The local extinction or near-extinction of Red-winged Francolin in the former Transkei and Ciskei is the result of severe overgrazing and annual burning of the grasslands. The current management policy of biennial burning and light grazing by wild herbivores in the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park in KwaZulu-Natal has provided one of the most important sanctuaries for Red-winged Francolins in southern Africa.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The smallest of southern Africa’s five cormorants is also known as the Long-tailed Cormorant because its tail is relatively longer than other cormorants’. This, together with its short bill and small size, distinguishes it from all other species except the closely related Crowned Cormorant. Fortunately, Reed Cormorants largely avoid marine habitats where the two species overlap, even commuting over the sea between roosting and feeding sites. However, they venture into the sea in tropical areas where Crowned Cormorants do not occur.</p><p>Reed Cormorants are common throughout most of their range, occurring at a wide variety of wetland habitats from lakes and dams to rivers and small pools. They are not threatened, and have benefited from the creation of dams. Like many waterbirds, they are partly migratory or nomadic, moving to take advantage of seasonal wetlands. Ringed birds have moved more than 1 000 kilometres from South Africa to Zambia. Even in areas with perennial wetlands they alter their feeding movements periodically, presumably in relation to local changes in food availability.</p><p>Reed Cormorants are common throughout most of their range, occurring at a wide variety of wetland habitats from lakes and dams to rivers and small pools.

Ringed birds have moved more than 1 000 kilometres from South Africa to Zambia. Even in areas with perennial wetlands they alter their feeding movements periodically, presumably in relation to local changes in food availability.</p><p>Like all cormorants, they have partially wettable plumage that reduces their buoyancy when diving, by limiting the amount of air trapped in their plumage. This saves energy while diving, but reduces their insulation, so they don’t remain in the water for long. On returning to shore, they often open their wings on an exposed perch. Initially interpreted as drying their wings, this is now thought to serve mainly to help the bird warm up. If the sun is shining, they orientate their backs to the sun and raise their back feathers to allow the sun to shine directly onto their skin. This also helps to warm their stomach contents, speeding up digestion.</p><p>Reed Cormorants typically feed in shallow water less than 2-3 metres deep, although sometimes up to 10 metres deep. The problem of buoyancy is greatest in shallow water because the air trapped in the plumage is compressed as birds dive deeper. Their long, rigid tail probably helps to counter buoyancy when feeding in shallow water. When held angled slightly upwards, it creates a downward force as the bird swims through the water with its large webbed feet. Dives are short; seldom lasting more than 40 seconds.</p><p>Foraging occurs singly or in flocks, when the cormorants dive together, often driving fish into shallow water. Such group foraging efforts attract egrets, Hamerkops, gulls and Pied Kingfishers. Reed Cormorants also join feeding groups of Great White Pelicans, occasionally snatching small fish that escape as the pelicans drain their pouches. Fish and frogs dominate their diet, but they also take invertebrates and even some aquatic plants. Large prey is brought to the surface where it is manoeuvred to swallow head first. This creates a dilemma – they mustn’t drop the prey, but the longer they grapple with it, the greater the risk that another bird will attempt to steal it. Gulls often steal from Reed Cormorants, but ibises and even other cormorants also try their luck.</p><p>Breeding typically occurs colonially, often together with herons, egrets, ibises, darters and other cormorants. They breed in trees, dense reed beds, cliffs and islands – anywhere where they can reduce the risk of predation. Clutch size averages 3-4 eggs in most of southern Africa, but only 2-3 eggs in the Western Cape. The chicks hatch naked and blind, but grow rapidly. When they are three weeks old they can leap out of the nest if disturbed, later climbing back to the nest. They fledge at roughly five weeks old, but continue to receive at least some food from their parents for several weeks after fledging.</p>",

The back is a very dark grey and the undertail coverts are white. They occur in family groups of three to eight birds which forage through the woodlands in which they occur. It is interesting that I have seen these birds joining up with flocks of White-crested Helmet-Shrikes and also the mixed-species bird parties which are so typical of the non-breeding season in the brachystegia woodlands of Zimbabwe. They seldom spend a long time with these mixed bird parties, however, as the group seem to prefer to be on their own.</p><p>The Retz’s Helmet-Shrike occurs from the extreme north of KwaZulu-Natal to the eastern part of South Africa, Mozambique, the whole of Zimbabwe and north-eastern and northern Botswana, with a small extension into Namibia. They don’t appear to be able to utilise the urban areas the way the White-crested species have done and are seldom seen here, even in areas where the surrounding woodlands have plenty of this species.</p><p>The Retz’s Helmet-Shrike occurs from the extreme north of KwaZulu-Natal to the eastern part of South Africa, Mozambique, the whole of Zimbabwe and north-eastern and northern Botswana, with a small extension into Namibia.

They do, however, have a variety of different calls, none of which are individually loud but when the flock calls in chorus, the volume is more evident.  The group chorus consists of a number of high-pitched whistles ‘tweeerr-r-r-r’ and also quite a lot of bill snapping.</p><p>It is noticeable that they move into a fairly tight flock moving from one tree to the next. One of the most interesting aspects of this particular species is their aggression towards certain birds of prey. In particular they are always the first birds to arrive when a Pearl-spotted Owl starts calling. Carl Vernon described how a stuffed owl elicited exactly the same reaction from this species. Considering the birds are fairly slow-moving, one would have thought that they would be placing themselves at risk mobbing an active predator like a small owl.</p><p>Once again these are group co-operative breeders with all the birds in the group helping to feed the chicks produced by the dominant female. It has been noted that all the members of the group help with the building of the nest, each bird first placing its contribution in the nest and turning around inside the cup to shape the nest and then flying off to allow the next bird to come in and do the same. The birds use a lot of spider web to bind the nest together, and a certain amount of spider web is also put on the outside of the nest.</p><p>Once the eggs hatch, all members of the group help to feed and to look after the chicks which will spend about three weeks in the nest. Thereafter the chicks move away with the group and will continue to be fed by the group for some two to three months. Towards the beginning of the following breeding season many young birds will leave their natal group and move off to form or join other groups in the area.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is one of the more widespread and familiar raptors in our region. It used to be considered as a race of the Common Kestrel F. tinnunculus, but recent analysis of plumages, measurements and genetics within the ‘red kestrel’ group (a complex of species and subspecies which collectively covers much of the globe) all point to it being a separate, uniquely southern African species. At a glance, it is a richly, brick-red coloured bird with a grey head cap, about the size of a pigeon, with longish wings and tail, and quite a dumpy body. The sexes are only marginally different in appearance, and the telltale features (browner heads and heavier barring on the rump and upper tail in females) are not always easy to see in the field, or even completely reliable.</p><p>‘Rockies’ can occur just about anywhere. They favour open, dry habitats and, as their common name suggests, they probably do best in rocky places. They have also adapted well to rural and urban development, and thrive in farmlands, suburbs and even industrial parks. They are typically seen perched on top of a roadside telephone pole, either basking in the early morning sun, actively perch-hunting, or merely sitting fluffed up and relaxed, enjoying the aftermath of a good meal.</p><p>‘Rockies’ can occur just about anywhere.

They are typically seen perched on top of a roadside telephone pole, either basking in the early morning sun, actively perch-hunting, or merely sitting fluffed up and relaxed, enjoying the aftermath of a good meal.</p><p>The Rock Kestrel is an accomplished flyer. Its slight build and relatively soft, loose feathering are ideally suited to close control, and it is its ability to fly very slowly that sets it apart as a hunter. It is rivalled only by the Black-shouldered Kite Elanus caeruleus among the southern African raptor fauna in its ability to truly hover, holding itself high and still in the air solely by means of the power and attitude of its rapidly beating wings, rather than just by passive dependence on updraughts to ‘wind-hover’. Active hovering allows kestrels to exploit hunting opportunities that may not be available to many of their competitors, but it is extremely tiring, and is usually reserved for optimal situations only, where the targeted prey are fat and juicy, and the likely returns on energy expenditure are high.</p><p>Rock Kestrels are essentially cliff-nesters, but they aren’t that fussy about cliff quality – breeding pairs may set up shop on anything from a small outcropping to a soaring, vertical buttress. Eggs (usually 3-4) are laid in a simple scrape on the sandy floor of a deeply sheltered recess. They are also quite at home on man-made structures, including quarries, road cuttings, and all sorts of buildings, from rural outhouses to downtown skyscrapers, and will also settle in disused stick nests (usually those of crows) built in trees or telephone or power poles. Nests are generally spaced at least a couple of kilometres apart, but where suitable sites are scarce and food is abundant; pairs may aggregate almost to the point of colonialism.</p><p>Even when breeding at high densities, Rock Kestrel pairs occupy exclusive nesting territories, and defend them fiercely against other kestrels, and virtually anything else that might threaten their security. The strident manner with which they heckle and drive off much bigger and more dangerous birds than themselves is testimony to their feisty nature, and belies their almost ‘cute and cuddly’ appearance. This is a remarkably adaptable species, and it is not a difficult bird to see. But with its predatory edge and flying prowess, the big-hearted Rock Kestrel can bring a touch of drama and class to an otherwise humdrum spell of birding, and it occupies a special place in the region’s community of ‘common’ birds.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Although technically a ‘songbird’, the Rock Martin is not noticeably vociferous, nor is it, with its mousey-brown colouration, one of the most conspicuous of our swallows. Nevertheless, it is widespread and with us throughout the year. It associates with human habitation, and quite often builds its nest under lean-to roofs of busy places such as farm stalls or restaurant verandas. The nest is usually plastered against a vertical wall, supported by a protruding truss or pole. I have seen a nest positioned above the jutting door lintel of a stone-walled cottage, and the martins were adept at slipping off the nest and gliding silently away along the wall, unnoticed, when anybody emerged from within.</p><p>In rural areas some Rock Martins still use natural breeding sites, attaching their nests to rock walls under the shelter of overhangs. They may well have shared such sites with early man as the Common House Martin is thought to have done in Eurasia, and developed their association with human dwellings in this way. Rock Martins have evidently expanded into some parts of southern Africa within historical times, occupying flat, featureless plains far from the rugged, cliff-strewn landscape that they usually prefer, utilising isolated buildings for nesting sites.</p><p>In rural areas some Rock Martins still use natural breeding sites, attaching their nests to rock walls under the shelter of overhangs.

Rock Martins have evidently expanded into some parts of southern Africa within historical times, occupying flat, featureless plains far from the rugged, cliff-strewn landscape that they usually prefer, utilising isolated buildings for nesting sites.</p><p>They do not commonly frequent some of the larger urban areas, possibly because small flying insects (such as aphids) are apt to be scarce above urban concrete. Cape Town is an exception, because the towering sandstone cliffs of Table Mountain make it a Rock Martin’s delight, and around the Company Gardens there is an abundance of sites on imposing buildings, on which these martins can rest and roost. The Parliament buildings, in particular, seem to be a favoured place to sleep, for in winter scores of Rock Martins roost in rows on its sheltered ledges.</p><p>These winter flocks break up in early spring as the breeding pairs resort to their personal nesting sites. The same nest tends to be used year after year, which suggests an enduring pair bond. If the nest has been destroyed during winter, or has been usurped by some other species, such as a Little Swift, the martins will find another site and build a new nest. The birds reinforce the mud walls with vegetable fibres or fine twigs and, like good bricklayers, they apply only so much mud each day so that the weight of the new, moist layer does not exceed its adhesion. Completing the task may take anything from three to seven weeks, depending in part on the availability of damp mud of the right consistency. This constraint may explain why Rock Martins (and other swallows that build nests from mud pellets) are scarce or absent in large urban centres, despite the availability of potential nesting sites, for mud is not easily come by in paved areas.</p><p>Both male and female undertake incubation of the two or three eggs. Incubation change-over is accomplished very smoothly, often with a magician-like sleight of wing, with the arriving and departing mates seeming to be part of one fluid movement. The newly hatched chicks are closely brooded by the adults in shifts for the first week, while the partner brings in enough food to feed each chick at roughly five-minute intervals. The fledglings are ready to leave the nest after about four weeks. Once they have left the nest the young birds can sometimes be seen perched with their parents on nearby telephone lines, but Rock Martins are well named and usually prefer to perch quietly and still on rocks or ledges where their brownish colouration blends well with the background and provides effective concealment.</p>",

Occasional overwintering birds have been found in drought years.</p><p>Over the remainder of its tropical range it is variably resident to migratory. It is not known where our birds go during the summer floods but it is likely that they move to the Congo basin where they would be masked by the larger, more sedentary populations. Although recorded earlier on the Lusitu River in Mozambique, it would appear from more recent atlassing that it no longer occurs there. All other southern populations seem to have disappeared, probably due to the silting of rivers causing their rock habitat to become buried, which habitat needs to be surrounded by fast flowing water to protect them from land-based predators. Even on the Zambezi there are several different populations occurring only where suitable habitat is found, and there may be long stretches in between where birds are absent. With the flooding of a large stretch of the Zambezi by Lake Kariba, much habitat must have been lost, and dam-building must forever remain as a potential hazard for this species. Today the best sites at which to find this bird are those on the Caprivi or upstream of the Victoria Falls, as the other sites downstream are only accessible by canoe. Occasional vagrants occur on farm dams. Four birds were once recorded at the main Harare airport, on the Zimbabwean Highveld, with extreme records to southern Botswana and Mpumalanga Province.</p><p>The central and southern African populations are estimated in the range of 25&#160;000 to 100&#160;000 birds! This high figure is based to a great extent on the large amount of rock exposed along the extensive reaches of the Congo River where they are very common, occurring from almost sea level to the mountains in the east. The West African population is much larger and differs in having a brownish collar as against the white collar (hence the older name of White-collared) of our birds. The total southern African population is probably not much more than 1 800 birds, this number including many non-breeders which probably only enter the breeding population from two years of age. Most breeding takes place during September and October when water levels are at their lowest and with the least chance of flash floods.</p><p>The generation of hydro-electric power on the middle Zambezi has created another problem in that electricity demands vary during the day hence the amount of water released through the turbines varies throughout a 24-hour period and at weekends. This in turn creates a ‘tidal’ effect along the river and especially in the rocky gorges where water is more concentrated. Not only are those birds nesting on rock outcrops affected but also those species that are the sandbank nesters.</p>",

Breeding during the winter and spring months on only two or three of South Africa’s offshore islands, the majority on Bird Island, it has been difficult to follow the vacillations of this bird and to understand why the regional population appears so unstable. Numbers breeding in South Africa in any one year fluctuate from about 70-80 pairs to as many as 300 pairs. Breeding success is also very variable, depending on weather conditions, food resources and predation. A significant proportion of the young reared each year have been ringed but only about 7% have been proven to return into the breeding population in subsequent years. So where do the remainder go? It would appear that our birds form part of the fringe of the large Madagascan popu&#173;lation and that there may be movement between the different breeding colonies each year, with only a small proportion returning to the same breeding islands in successive breeding seasons. Unlike the well-studied populations of the north Atlantic, it seems that some adults in both South Africa and on the Seychelles may not breed every year.</p><p>Our southernmost birds show intermediate genetic characteristics to the populations of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans on the one hand and the North Atlantic on the other. It is likely that the two populations – now separated – overlapped during a previous ice age and then parted company as the ice caps retreated, leaving a relict population that occurs today from Tanzania south through Madagascar to South Africa. Interestingly, these winter-breeding birds show closer affinities to those of the north Atlantic than to other populations in the Indian Ocean. There is another population in coastal Kenya and Somalia that extends eastwards to the Seychelles: these birds differ in plumage from the more southerly birds. A third western Indian Ocean population breeds in the austral summer on shoals to the north of Mauritius. These latter birds occasionally wander westwards to KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, where they are out of synchrony with local birds in both the timing of moult and the acquisition of breeding plumage.</p><p>Our southernmost birds show intermediate genetic characteristics to the populations of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans on the one hand and the North Atlantic on the other.

However, a careful look through tern flocks will often reveal the presence of one or more Roseate Terns, even well to the west or east of their breeding range. The Roseate Tern is slightly smaller and slimmer than Common Tern, has distinctly paler upperparts and a slimmer, clearly decurved bill. The very pale pink of the underparts can sometimes be seen, this changing to pale terracotta during summer when birds are moulting. This alone can draw one’s attention to the bird. The young have variably marked upperparts, but these are moulted out within a couple of months of fledging, after which the birds look similar to non-breeding adults.</p><p>The numbers of Roseate Terns that remain in the region during the summer months are not known, but it is thought that a proportion of the population leaves the area entirely, only returning in June or July. It is possible, however, that these are thinly scattered along the coast from KwaZulu-Natal in the east to Cape Columbine in the west. The large majority remain in Algoa Bay and St Francis Bays during the non-breeding period, when they are most readily found at Cape Recife, outside Port Elizabeth.</p>",

Furthermore, much of this habitat is either already destroyed or under threat of degradation or destruction from a range of agricultural activities and from wetland drainage. Because of this loss or potential loss of habitat, the Rosy-throated Longclaw is classified as Near-threatened.</p><p>Rosy-throated Longclaws are usually found in pairs and sometimes in small family groups. They are not the easiest of birds to spot, because they do not flush readily at one’s approach, preferring to crouch and hide or scuttle off beneath the grass. When one is startled into flight by the approach of an intruder it does not fly very far before dropping to the ground and running off unseen into the grass.</p><p>Rosy-throated Longclaws are usually found in pairs and sometimes in small family groups.

When one is startled into flight by the approach of an intruder it does not fly very far before dropping to the ground and running off unseen into the grass.</p><p>A singing male Rosy-throated Longclaw is sometimes more approachable as he is apt to mount some low vantage point from which to advertise his presence. The height of preferred song posts appears to vary regionally. In some areas a small termite mound, lower than the general height of the surrounding grass, is favoured; in other regions these birds may perch on top of a fence post or on the tops of low trees or bushes that are less than two metres high.</p><p>The commonly used call is variously transcribed as ‘wee-chew, wee-chew’, or ‘cheet-err’, and these calls are usually uttered from the ground. Unlike the other longclaw species, the Rosy-throated seldom calls in flight, except during the summer months when it utters its melodious song. At such times the singing male is said to fly so high that he is difficult to detect with the naked human eye, but rivals obviously see him clearly enough, as males sometimes indulge in aerial combat.</p><p>Like other members of their family, Rosy-throated Longclaws nest on the ground, concealing their nest in the hollow centre of an old grass stool well overhung by neighbouring grass tussocks. The female appears to do most of the nest construction and incubation of the 2-3 eggs. The male helps with the provisioning of the chicks for their 16-day nestling period. When approaching the nest with food for the young, these longclaws may walk part of the way on tops of the bent-over grass blades, distributing their weight with the elongated hind claw. When closer to the nest they usually drop down to the ground and walk the rest of the way under cover of the grass. When the nestlings fledge they are scarcely able to fly, and look rather weird with their very short tail feathers and long legs, but if either parent gives an alarm call they crouch down and lie very still.</p><p>If an observer approaches the nesting area, the male may commence a distraction display, flying jerkily just above the grass in an attempt to lure the intruder away from the vicinity. This sort of behaviour is rare in passerine birds, but is practised by other longclaw species and by some wagtails.</p>",

The Rosy-faced Lovebird’s peach-pink face, emerald-green body and azure-blue rump render it as attractive as any in the genus. Lovebirds are extremely social and take their name from their charming partiality for mutual preening. Flock members will also regularly and apparently spontaneously feed one another by regurgitation.</p><p>The Rosy-faced Lovebird is near-endemic to southern Africa, extending from the arid far Northern Cape, through the parched reaches of Namibia, to the deserts of southern Angola (where a separate subspecies occurs). Despite its association with aridity, it needs access to surface water, and these birds drink frequently. It has doubtless benefited immensely from the plethora of artificial water points so characteristic of the stock-farming areas that comprise most of its range. The delicate appearance of this diminutive character seems best suited for life in bountiful tropical-forest settings rather than the stark desert environment of its actual home. Somehow this ostensibly fragile little parrot always seems out of place in these unforgiving landscapes of sun-baked rock, sand and lonely desert trees.

It can be a crop pest, and one study documented its penchant for sunflower seeds. Bizarrely, and similarly in contrast to its cutesy image, it is not averse to tucking into the dung of large herbivores such as cattle and horses. Radio-tracking studies show that when hard-pressed in winter, this lovebird will range at least 4.5 km from its nest in search of localised food patches.</p><p>Rosy-faced Lovebirds usually nest colonially. Their breeding sites are typically situated in cavities in rock faces, or in the massive nest structures of Sociable Weavers, although they will also use the nests of White-browed Sparrow-Weavers and Red-billed Buffalo-Weavers. In addition, they exploit nesting recesses associated with buildings and other human structures, such as bridges, windmills, and electrical and telephone infrastructure. I remember seeing them flying in and out of the eaves of chalets at Augrabies Falls National Park. Success seems enhanced at these artificial sites, likely due to reduced predation. The Boomslang Dispholidus typus is one confirmed nest raider. Along the exacting coast of Namibia, the species seems locally commensal in the seaboard towns of Walvis Bay, Lüderitz and Oranjemund. One fascinating habit in some lovebirds (and a few other parrots) is that they transport the vegetation they use to line their nest cavities by tucking it into their body plumage. In Rosy-faced Lovebirds this material, comprising bark strips, grass and leaves, is inserted into their rump and lower back feathers. Lovebirds are unusual (but not unique) among parrots in the practice of this rudimentary nest-building behaviour.</p><p>Once, when checking Sociable Weaver nests in Camel Thorns Acacia erioloba for Pygmy Falcons near Kenhardt in the Northern Cape, I came across Rosy-faced Lovebirds that were likely breeding in these structures. This was surprising as Kenhardt seemed beyond the known range at that time. A further surprise was a Verreaux’s Eagle nest with a chick in one of the Camel Thorns, a most unusual site for this raptor. The juxtaposition of striking encounters with two so dissimilar birds has forever fused, and coloured, my reminiscences of both.</p>",

The type specimen was collected in 1904 at Wakkerstroom in Mpumalanga Province, and the bird’s association with this village has continued ever since. Austin Roberts discovered the first nest here in 1913 and several postgraduate studies on the bird have been conducted around Wakkerstroom since then, with the result that it is now a rather well-known, if elusive, bird. On the basis of its very restricted global range it is red-listed as a Vulnerable species.</p><p>The bird is much like a large cisticola, with a plump body, disproportionately long legs and a spindly tail. It is resident, occurs solitarily, or in pairs while breeding, is insectivorous, and forages by walking briskly between grass tufts, gleaning small insects from the grass and ground. It favours areas with a short, dense grass cover but it is not easily spotted on the ground. In midsummer, however, the males perform an aerial display and they are then much more detectable, flying up and circling in the air, perhaps 30-50 m above the ground, uttering a distinctive squeaky song, a far-carrying ‘witch-ee-wee’ or variations of this, at about five- to six-second intervals. The performance can last for up to 30 minutes before the bird descends in a steep dive back to the ground and is lost to view.</p><p>The bird is much like a large cisticola, with a plump body, disproportionately long legs and a spindly tail.

        "Body_Content": "<p>With their boldly-patterned plumage, Ruddy Turnstones are one of the easiest waders to identify, and one of the most charismatic. As their common name suggests, they use their short, wedge-shaped bill to flick over seaweed, dung and small stones to locate prey. They are extremely versatile foragers, taking a wide diversity of prey, but individuals often specialise on a particular prey type. For example the crop of one Turnstone collected on Marcus Island was full of seabird ticks, and another full of sea spiders (pycnogonids). They also steal food from other waders and are not averse to eating carrion – one in Alaska was even seen feeding from a human corpse.</p><p>Given their dietary flexibility, it is perhaps surprising that they are largely confined to the coast. Small numbers occur at inland wetlands throughout southern Africa, but most are birds on passage, and they seldom remain for long. On the coast they are usually found on rocky shores, dancing nimbly over the intertidal zone in pursuit of food, hence the attractive German name Steinwälzer. Their dark upperparts typically blend well with the rocks, and their presence is often only revealed when they take flight, when their white striped wings and back are conspicuous. On mixed rocky and sandy shores they often form loose flocks with Sanderlings and Curlew Sandpipers.</p><p>Given their dietary flexibility, it is perhaps surprising that they are largely confined to the coast.

On mixed rocky and sandy shores they often form loose flocks with Sanderlings and Curlew Sandpipers.</p><p>Ruddy Turnstones breed along Arctic coastlines, and winter over a broad latitudinal range from the UK to southern South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The first adults reach the southern African coast in late August, with most arriving in September and early October. Ringing recoveries show that our visitors come from over half of their polar range, from 90°W in Ellesmere Island in northern Canada to 110-120°E in Siberia.</p><p>Birds from Canada, Greenland and perhaps Scandinavia migrate through Europe and along the west African coastline, mainly wintering as far south as Namibia. Birds from western Russia probably migrate through the Baltic Sea, flying across Europe and Africa to reach their winter quarters on the south and west coasts. The easternmost birds pass through the Black and Caspian seas and then down the east coast of Africa. That considerable numbers overfly Africa is indicated by the regular occurrence of birds at inland wetlands during the southward migration, with several thousand adult birds once recorded on Zambia’s Kafue Flats in late September.</p><p>The Turnstones spend a relaxing new year on the southern African coast. Ringing recoveries show that individuals usually return to the same site each year. Thereafter, many adults head up the west coast to fatten up on the rich food resources of the Benguela coast. From February onwards they become increasingly frenetic, foraging day and night, adding 50% to their body mass over the pre-migration period. Birds from across the breeding range occur together at this stage, heading north along the coast from late March through April. Some follow the west coast all the way to Europe, whereas others head inland from the Gulf of Guinea direct to the central Mediterranean. Most juveniles overwinter, as do a few second winter birds.</p><p>Based on counts in the 1980s, southern Africa supports an estimated 39 000 Ruddy Turnstones each summer. However, there have been changes in their abundance in different regions over the last few decades. Numbers at Walvis Bay, Namibia, appear to have increased in recent years, whereas those in the Western Cape have decreased by almost 60%, with decreases more marked on the south coast than on the west coast. Further surveys are required to see if the regional population as a whole has decreased, or whether the regional trends reflect different population trajectories for birds breeding in different parts of the Arctic.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Ruff are one of the commonest Palaearctic waders to visit freshwater habitats throughout southern Africa. They typically occur in small flocks, which often join together to roost at night, when thousands may gather at favoured sites (typically characterised by large, open areas of mud or shallow water). When feeding, they exploit a wide range of habitats, and are equally at home picking prey from muddy banks, probing into the mud in shallow water, or picking prey from the water surface while swimming like phalaropes. They also sometimes venture away from water, feeding in short grass and fallow fields.</p><p>Ruffs breed from western Europe to the Chukotka Peninsula in eastern Siberia, and most winter in Africa, with smaller numbers in Europe, the Middle East and India, and regular vagrants reaching Australia. There is a degree of partitioning of the African wintering grounds between different segments of the population. Birds from Europe winter on the floodplains of the major river systems of West Africa, those from western Siberia mostly occur in East Africa, and the most easterly breeding popu&#173;lations visit southern Africa. This makes the birds reaching our region one of the longest-distance migrants in the world, travelling more than 16&#160;000 km each way. The total population is estimated at about 2-3 million birds, of which 50 to 200 thousand visit southern Africa.</p><p>Ruffs breed from western Europe to the Chukotka Peninsula in eastern Siberia, and most winter in Africa, with smaller numbers in Europe, the Middle East and India, and regular vagrants reaching Australia.

The total population is estimated at about 2-3 million birds, of which 50 to 200 thousand visit southern Africa.</p><p>There is strong sexual dimorphism, with the males much larger than the females. The difference is so marked that it is easy to see in the field. In breeding plumage the males are adorned with variably coloured/patterned neck ruffs and topknots, hence the common name. Unfortunately this extravagant plumage is only acquired after they leave our area in February and is mostly lost by the time they return in August.</p><p>At the breeding grounds, the males arrive before the females and set up ‘leks’ or display areas where they gather in groups to try to attract the females’ attention. The females can make direct comparisons between males, and choose the ‘sexiest’ male with which to mate. This results in a few males monopolising most breeding opportunities which drives the selection for specific characters such as their large size and foppish plumage. Once mating is complete the females leave the lek and get on with the business of breeding without having anything further to do with the males. Their nest sites may be some considerable distance from the leks.</p><p>Because the males have to return to the breeding grounds first, they tend to winter farther north than the females. Thus there are a decreasing percentage of males in the population the further south one goes, and it appears that most males visiting southern Africa are first- and second-year birds. On their northern migration, the males often gather to the south of their tundra breeding sites with large concentrations occurring on the Lena and Olenek Rivers. It is here that the local hunters may take quite a heavy toll of males in particular.</p><p>After mating, the males and non-breeding and failed-breeding females start to move west across a broad front, some even reaching Europe before turning south for Africa, but most cross the Caspian and Black Sea regions before heading down the Nile valley. The earliest arrivals reach southern Africa at the end of the first week of August. The young of the year start to arrive in September but most arrive in November-December. Males depart mainly in February and females from late March to early May. Small numbers of first-year birds may overwinter, mainly females, but occasionally larger flocks remain, with records of up to 3&#160;000 birds in some winters.</p>",

The female differs from the male by having an overall more sooty coloration and a narrow, pale stripe down the throat. At the onset of the breeding cycle the legs, bill and cere flush briefly to a glowing pink, reverting back to yellow once incubation gets underway.</p><p>The Rufous-bellied Heron is a dark-plumaged bird and, at a glance, could be mistaken for a Black Heron or a Slaty Egret.

They are rather unobtrusive birds and, unless flushed, are easily overlooked. When they do fly up they generally fly some distance before dropping back into concealing vegetation. Their hunting technique is typical of other small herons. They either still-hunt, standing in one place alertly watching for any movement in the water below, or they walk slowly forward with neck extended and head tilted, ready to strike when prey is sighted.</p><p>One of the outlying dots on the distribution maps pinpoint the floodplain of the Nyl River in Limpopo Province, and this is probably one of the most likely places to find the bird within South Africa. Its occurrence here is erratic, which is only partly explained by the irregularity of flooding. There are years when flooding occurs and yet Rufous-bellied Herons go unrecorded.</p><p>One particular season on the Nyl stands out for me: the summer of 1965/66 followed four successive drought years when the floodplain remained wholly dry. The drought broke in early 1966, when the heavens opened and many thousands of hectares were inundated, attracting waterbirds of all sorts. Many heron species moved in en masse and among them were a sprinkling of Rufous-bellied Herons.</p><p>Following the flooding, breeding got under way quickly for Dwarf Bitterns and Squacco Herons, many of them building their nests in the temporarily flooded thorn trees. Rufous-bellied Herons took longer to initiate breeding but I did find and monitor five of their nests, some of these placed within a few metres of either an active Squacco Heron or Dwarf Bittern nest. Each laid a four-egg clutch, but of these 20 eggs fewer than ten produced young. I ascertained that the incubation period was 21-22 days, a fact subsequently confirmed by studies from the Okavango, and that the nestlings scrambled off their nests from a young age, only to return when a parent arrived with food. Both sexes incubated and both fed the nestlings.</p><p>As the summer progressed into autumn so the floodplain matured and became densely overgrown and, by late May, although there was still an abundance of water in the system, Rufous-bellied Herons moved off and weren’t seen again until another flood, years later.</p>",

Although also found to the north of our region in southern Zambia and Angola, it is largely confined to the central and western parts of southern Africa, where it is a breeding summer migrant. It occupies terrain largely shunned by other nightjar species in southern Africa – the vast, semi-arid interior and treeless plains of the dry west, avoiding the moister eastern areas of Mozambique, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. It favours open, mixed woodland in Limpopo and North West Provinces, Kalahari woodland and scrub in Botswana and Namibia, and Karoo semi-desert in the Northern and Western Cape. In Zimbabwe it frequents miombo woodland in a narrow altitudinal range from 1&#160;000 – 1&#160;600 metres. This nightjar is absent from the true Namib Desert and is highly localised in the Western Cape coastal regions.</p><p>Although occurring widely across our region in summer, this trans-Equatorial migrant is almost entirely absent in the winter months. Most of the birds spend April to August mainly in Cameroon, but also in Nigeria, South Sudan and the southern DRC. Small numbers overwinter in southern Africa, particularly in north-western Zimbabwe. In September the nightjars return to their breeding grounds in southern Africa.</p><p>Although occurring widely across our region in summer, this trans-Equatorial migrant is almost entirely absent in the winter months.

In September the nightjars return to their breeding grounds in southern Africa.</p><p>Like other nightjars in our region, it is crepuscular in habits, feeding in the twilight of dawn and dusk, as well as on moonlit nights. Beetles, moths, termites and other insects form the bulk of the prey. Still-hunting from the ground or a perch is the usual mode of foraging, with the nightjars making sallies to catch passing insects. In the early evening, however, hunting may take place on the wing in continuous flight. At times numbers of these nightjars may gather at artificially-lit water holes to feed on insects attracted to the lights. They drink by skimming the surface of the water like a swallow. During daylight hours they roost under a bush or in tall grass singly or in pairs, where they invariably go undetected.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable feature of this nightjar is its extraordinary, loud churring call, heard especially at dusk and dawn as well as on moonlit nights. It is a mechanical-sounding ‘quorrrrrrrr...’ that has often been likened to the sound of a motorbike, and may last for several minutes without a pause. Other commonly heard calls are an explosive, repeated ‘Q-whoop!’ which may precede the churring call, and single ‘Q’ or ‘chuck’ notes given in flight. Des Jackson, who studied the calling habits of this species, found that birds usually call from the ground, especially gravel roads and tracks – and only occasionally from a perch in a tree. When giving the ‘Q-whoop’ calls, the head is flexed forward and downward and when churring, it is extended, the white throat patches showing prominently.</p><p>Most breeding takes place between September and November, with the birds favouring elevated ground and dry ridges over lower-lying moist areas. Two glossy, pinkish cream eggs are laid on a gravelly substratum, on burnt ground in fire-swept woodland or amongst short, sparse grass. Females incubate and brood the young in the day with males assisting with parental duties at night.</p><p>The Rufous-cheeked Nightjar is closely related to the European Nightjar, and the two species occur together in some areas. They share many plumage features and can be difficult to separate in the field. However, the European Nightjar is a larger bird, with longer wings; it usually has an obvious white wing bar and lacks the tawny-rufous hind-neck collar and salmon wing spots of the Rufous-cheeked Nightjar. European Nightjars seldom, if ever, call in Africa.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Rufous-chested Sparrowhawks have the most restricted range of any accipiter in southern Africa, extending from the wooded suburbs of Cape Town eastwards through the southern and eastern Cape and fringes of the Karoo into the high-lying areas of the eastern highveld. Their fragmented range continues northwards from here into East Africa, following the line of isolated Afromontane blocks that link South Africa and Ethiopia. Although they do much of their hunting in open country, these are birds that were once dependent on Afromontane forest for breeding sites, whereas today they have adapted widely to using copses and plantations of alien trees for this purpose, and their range has extended widely into formerly treeless areas as a result. Virtually all recorded nests today are in stands of eucalypts, pines, poplars or wattles, and many of these nesting sites are small, isolated groves of trees, some in the Karoo and others in the grassland, often surrounded by kilometres of treeless plains.</p><p>Hunting in open country is done mostly by stealth flying, keeping close to the ground, hugging the contours, using vegetation to conceal its approach, then accelerating when prey is flushed and snatching it up in its talons. It is primarily a bird hunter – 98% of its prey comprised birds in one study – and the birds that are commonly caught in this way include pipits, larks, longclaws, chats, cisticolas, waxbills, canaries, sparrows, weavers and others that forage or live on the ground. Hunting sorties are usually conducted within 2 kilometres of the nesting grove but may on occasion extend much further, and the prey caught is typically brought back to the shelter of the trees to consume or pass on to the mate. At times Red-breasted Sparrowhawks soar over their nesting areas, and they may then stoop onto prey spotted below. They are opportunistic to the extent that they’ll also dive from a perch to catch something on the ground below, even taking an occasional rodent or lizard in this way.</p><p>Hunting in open country is done mostly by stealth flying, keeping close to the ground, hugging the contours, using vegetation to conceal its approach, then accelerating when prey is flushed and snatching it up in its talons.

The Ovambo and the Red-breasted Sparrowhawks do not overlap in range but instead replace each other in their chosen habitats, the former living in savanna and the latter in the environment described above.</p><p>The bird’s nesting cycle has been studied in detail, and in most respects it resembles that of other accipiters. Pairs reuse the same copses of trees annually, and some of these have been in known use for decades. A new nest is usually built each season, placed in a high vertical fork of a tree, and the female undertakes most of this, building the shallow platform of twigs over the course of 3-8 weeks. In September or October she lays a clutch of three eggs, one per day, and she commences incubation when the clutch is complete. Males play little role in this, and instead hunt and provide her with all her food at this time, bringing in an average three items a day. He calls as he arrives in the nest grove, and she leaves the nest and takes the prey to a favoured perch to eat. The eggs hatch after 34-35 days and, with nestlings to feed, the male increases his delivery rate to five or six items a day, dropping most of these off at the nest. As the young birds mature and then, at about five weeks, leave the nest, so they become increasingly noisy, soliciting food from the parents with loud, whining calls, ‘kieeeeeu’, and versions of this, and letting all and sundry know about their hunger and their presence in the woods.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Rufous-eared Warblers occupy the arid and semi-arid shrubland on plains and slopes in the Karoo and Kalahari, and the shrubby vegetation in dry drainage lines on the edge of the Namib Desert. They tend to prefer shorter shrublands than other warblers such as Grey-backed Cisticolas and Karoo Prinias in this habitat and do not occur in gardens, even those adjacent to their preferred habitat. It could be that the birds have a low tolerance to habitat transformation, or that gardens are simply not a surrogate for shrublands.</p><p>Nevertheless, Rufous-eared Warblers are a common species of arid areas, usually alone or in pairs, sometimes in small family parties, rapidly hopping and bounding mouse-like over the ground between shrubs and bushes, disappearing between shrubs and low down into bushes, and emerging at the top. The species is another of our western arid-zone endemics, and is found from about Spitzkoppe in Namibia southwards to the karroid areas of the Western Cape Province, and east across south-western Botswana to the western parts of the North West Province, western Free State and edge of the Nama Karoo in the Eastern Cape Province. There is an isolated population around Etosha Pan in Namibia, and they do not occur in the Namib Desert itself. The birds are resident, but almost certainly move locally in response to rain or the lack of it, and on our farm the numbers of Rufous-eared Warblers increase and decrease according to environmental conditions.</p><p>Nevertheless, Rufous-eared Warblers are a common species of arid areas, usually alone or in pairs, sometimes in small family parties, rapidly hopping and bounding mouse-like over the ground between shrubs and bushes, disappearing between shrubs and low down into bushes, and emerging at the top.

The birds are resident, but almost certainly move locally in response to rain or the lack of it, and on our farm the numbers of Rufous-eared Warblers increase and decrease according to environmental conditions.</p><p>Rufous-eared Warblers are monogamous and territorial, with large territories and widely spaced nests in the dry Karoo. Territorial boundaries are maintained year-round. Some pairs are co-operative breeders with helpers at the nest – this may depend on rainfall and the primary productive status of the rangeland in which they are nesting – low productivity is thought to promote co-operative breeding because of the difficulty of lone birds finding food. The nest is an untidy oval with a side-top entrance, made of dry grey grass leaves and stems, or strips of grey silky bark from the reed-like Lammerlat Gomphocarpus filifolius. The latter is a highly desirable nest material, and the birds will fly hundreds of metres to get it. Nests are bound with spider web and lined with plant down such as the fluffy seeds of Karoo Rosemary Eriocephalus. The nest site is low down in a shrub, usually about 0.5 metres above ground. A wide range of succulents, woody shrubs and sapling trees are used for nesting.</p><p>Incubation duties are not known, but presumably are shared between the sexes. The nestlings are fed by both parents, mainly on small insects such as grasshoppers and caterpillars. Rufous-eared Warblers are not particularly sensitive to disturbance when nesting, although this may vary between pairs. A nest in the road verge on our farm was successful, raising three chicks, and another nest next to a frequently used path also produced flying young. On the other hand, some nests found being built or at an early egg stage, have been deserted by the birds.</p><p>Foraging and food of the Rufous-eared Warbler is quite well known. The birds forage mainly on the ground at the bases of shrubs and succulents, or low down in shrubs, gleaning food items from stems and leaves. Their food covers a wide range of invertebrates and some fruits. Food items include weevils, caterpillars, beetles (Cassidae, Carabidae), plant hoppers (Cicadellidae), termites, coccids, bugs (Pentatomidae), ants, grasshoppers, spiders and ticks, the fruit pulp and seeds of asparagus, honey-thorns and alien Creeping Saltbush Atriplex semibaccata plants. &#9;</p>",

It is present in various open savanna and grassland types, provided that grass is not too tall or dense, that some open soil is available for foraging, and that there are scattered higher perches from which to sing. It may also be found in recently burned fields, where an abundance of exposed, disorientated or dead insects are an irresistible attraction.</p><p>The Rufous-naped Lark occurs widely in the Afrotropics, and in southern Africa it is unquestionably one of the most common larks and grassland bird species in general.

It may also be found in recently burned fields, where an abundance of exposed, disorientated or dead insects are an irresistible attraction.</p><p>During the summer breeding season, the Rufous-naped Lark’s atmospheric whistled song is inescapable, and several males can often be heard from any one spot. As males typically sing from a prominent perch such as a termite mound, bush, boulder or fence post, the singer is easy to spot with a little scanning, and is frequently very approachable (and photogenic!). They are resident and probably partly territorial throughout the year, but are less frequently recorded in the winter non-breeding season when they are less vocal.</p><p>While singing, the male Rufous-naped Lark is easy to identify thanks to its conspicuously raised spiky, rufous crest. Between song phrases, it will often jump a few centimetres up and briefly rattle its wings. The song consists of a loud, clear and far-carrying whistle of multiple syllables, often rendered as “tseee-tseee’ooo”. Despite the apparent simplicity of this phrase, endless subtle variations are discernible to the practised ear. Rarely, males also sing in flight, giving a sustained, rambling song including much mimicry.</p><p>The pair usually remain in close proximity when foraging. At such times the characteristic crest is lowered and the birds are generally more skulking, and may pose an identification challenge to the uninitiated. Their diet consists of insects, including beetles, bugs, crickets, grasshoppers, mantids, ants, termites, larvae and caterpillars, as well as other small invertebrates like earthworms, millipedes, spiders and solifugids or sunspiders. Some seed is also ingested. Most prey is picked directly from open soil or from vegetation, but is sometimes briefly pursued in flight or exposed by performing shallow excavations using the bill or feet.</p><p>The birds are wisely silent and secretive while breeding is under way, and finding the nest requires detective work and patience. It is placed in a depression between grass tufts, and consists of a cup-shaped base with a circular roof and an entrance on one side. Typical clutches contain two to three heavily mottled eggs that are incubated for about two weeks. Both sexes feed the young, which leave the nest after 10-12 days.</p><p>Five subspecies, of the staggering 23 currently ‘listed for this species’, are represented in southern Africa. The nominate africana occurs along the East Coast from just west of Port Elizabeth northwards into Mozambique. The slightly paler and less richly coloured transvaalensis, as its name implies, occupies the old Transvaal as well as adjacent Botswana and most of Zimbabwe. These two subspecies are separated by a band of lower occurrence in the high-lying sour grasslands of the Drakensberg escarpment. In northern Botswana and the Caprivi, the greyer griscescens subspecies is found, while southern Botswana and Namibia is home to the pinkish, lightly streaked ghansiensis. Finally, the subspecies pallida is restricted to the Etosha Pan region in Namibia.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Sabota Lark is highly variable in plumage, with eight subspecies across its broad southern African range. It is largely endemic to the region, although it extends up the Angolan coast and even has a far-flung endemic race in Cabinda. All forms, however, are united by a conspicuous white eyebrow. It lacks the rufous in the wings so typical of Mirafra larks and the Fawn-coloured Lark. Unlike the latter species, it essentially shuns sandy ground and is more typical of clay soils and rocky areas. The species is largely resident and sedentary throughout its range.</p><p>The Sabota Lark has recently been removed from the genus Mirafra and placed in the resurrected Calendulauda, along with the Fawn-coloured Lark, the various larks in the ‘Karoo Lark’ complex and two species occurring further north in Africa. The utility of this arrangement, however, is perhaps questionable.</p><p>The Sabota Lark has recently been removed from the genus Mirafra and placed in the resurrected Calendulauda, along with the Fawn-coloured Lark, the various larks in the ‘Karoo Lark’ complex and two species occurring further north in Africa. The utility of this arrangement, however, is perhaps questionable.</p><p>The three Sabota Lark subspecies found in the extreme south and west of the range are quite distinct from the other forms. They inhabit barren karroid vegetation with scattered low bushes on hard, stony ground, quite unlike the acacia-dominated woodlands favoured by the others of their kin. They have particularly large and stout beaks and dig forcefully for food in the harsh arid landscapes they inhabit. It has long been argued that these awl-billed birds should be considered a separate species. Initial genetic investigations provide some support for this but more detailed confirmation is required, and there is apparent extensive morphological intergradation between the karroid and woodland forms in the north. Nevertheless, many a bushveld birder familiar with the slender and warm-brown woodland versions of this lark has been completely stumped when faced with the bulky, greyer and formidably armed ‘Bradfield’s Lark’ on their first trip to the open desolate wastes of the Karoo, especially if equally unfamiliar with the similarly western-distributed Large-billed Lark.</p><p>The Sabota Lark is one of the most garrulous members of its family. Its vocalisations include melodious whistles and trills, as well as buzzes, all combined with extensive and elaborate mimicry. It is rivalled locally in the mimicry stakes by only the Melodious Lark and the Cossypha robin-chats. Rick Nuttall listened to one male cycle through 59 vocalisations from 49 bird species in just ten minutes. To walk for any distance through the habitat of this cheeky little fellow is to soon have one take up stance on a low shrub or tree to pour forth an unending and vitriolic scolding in the form of notes stolen from just about every other bird species with which it shares its home.</p><p>This lark achieved a measure of ‘digital-age’ notoriety when Derek Engelbrecht posted camera-trap photos on the internet of a sinister Boomslang sinking its fangs into a well-grown but helpless nestling.</p><p>Sabota Larks feed on the ground, taking invertebrates, seeds and green vegetable matter. It is attracted to burnt ground as quickly as within the hour. Drinking was only recorded for the first time as recently as 2009 by Derek Engelbrecht involving one of the Karoo races.</p><p>Nests are constructed on the ground and may have a domed roof if not covered by overhanging vegetation. The clutch is 2-4 eggs. Nestlings are fed by both parents. A bird disturbed while incubating may perform a distraction display. Both Carl Vernon and Gordon Maclean suggested that this species mimics the alarm calls of other birds when in distress itself, e.g. the latter found that one bird troubled near the nest mimicked the anxiety call of the Double-banded Courser and advocated “this may be an example of imitation in which the context of the imitated call has been retained”.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Saddle-billed Stork is in trouble in southern Africa. Aerial surveys of the Okavango Delta, its stronghold in the region, show a population of only 800 to 1 100 birds, with a suggestion that numbers may be declining. This is alarming – at over 10 000 square kilometres in extent, the Okavango could reasonably be expected to support a much larger population. This species is so conspicuous from the air that aerial surveys are accurate assessments of the numbers of birds in an area. However, in most parts of southern Africa the birds are spread very thinly over the country because of the limited suitable clean water habitat.</p><p>In part, the small population size relates to the species’ solitary habit – it occurs in pairs and small groups, and a flock of 37, such as was recorded at Lake Ngami in northern Botswana recently, is exceptional. Consequently, numbers throughout the remainder of the subregion are also relatively low. However, in most areas, populations are not only small, but declining. For example, the storks’ plight has been well publicised in the Kruger National Park, where numbers fell to a mere 40 individuals in 2010, due to degradation of the large rivers flowing through the park. In neighbouring Swaziland, which admittedly does not have much suitable habitat, Saddle-billed Storks are now regarded as locally extinct.</p><p>In part, the small population size relates to the species’ solitary habit – it occurs in pairs and small groups, and a flock of 37, such as was recorded at Lake Ngami in northern Botswana recently, is exceptional.

In neighbouring Swaziland, which admittedly does not have much suitable habitat, Saddle-billed Storks are now regarded as locally extinct.</p><p>In Namibia, the species is also thinly spread, with an estimated maximum of 200 birds, some of which are ‘shared’ with northern Botswana along the Kwando-Linyanti river system (about 100 individuals) and the Chobe-Zambezi (25 to 30 birds). These rivers provide good habitat for the storks, and the fact that there are only four breeding records for the species in Namibia must (hopefully) be due to under-reporting. The protected areas in the Zambezi Region are definitely important for the long-term survival of Saddle-billed Storks. The status of the Saddle-billed Stork in southern Mozambique is poorly known, but there are thought to be no more than 30 pairs. In Zimbabwe, the situation is slightly more encouraging, with about 500 pairs concentrated along the Zambezi and other large rivers, and growing numbers of storks associated with man-made water impoundments in areas where they did not occur previously.</p><p>In order to understand the basis for these declines, it is necessary to know something about the life history of the species. Saddle-billed Storks are large, colourful birds which catch fish and frogs by patiently standing and waiting for any unsuspecting prey item to venture nearby. To thrive, they need healthy wetlands and naturally functioning river systems with an abundance of aquatic life. As is typical of large birds, the Saddle-billed Stork’s reproductive rate is low. They take several years to reach sexual maturity and to form pair bonds. They construct enormous platform nests on top of large riverine trees in which to lay their eggs and rear their young. Interestingly, the stork has a relatively large clutch size of up to four eggs, but unless optimal habitat exists for the offspring, mortality rates can be high among dispersing immatures.</p><p>Habitat degradation and the impacts of water regulation are common threats to storks throughout southern Africa, and these issues need to be addressed in the interest of the well-being of humans as well as these charismatic birds. What is good for birds is invariably good for people too, and we cannot afford to ignore the clear warning signals from this conspicuous indicator species.</p>",

The main wintering area is off the west coast of South America, but some come round Cape Horn through the Drake Passage into the south-west Atlantic, and an adult was recently found ashore on Gough Island, where it dwarfed the local Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatrosses.

The status of the small, relict population breeding farther east at St Paul Island in the temperate Indian Ocean is uncertain.

In southern Africa, stranded Salvin’s Prions have been recorded from the Western Cape to southern Mozambique, but until recently there were few, if any, well-substantiated sightings at sea. However, they are now known to be fairly common in the Agulhas Retroflection south of South Africa, at least in autumn, and small flocks have been photographed inside the 200 nautical mile limit of territorial waters. The population on Marion Island was affected by feral cat predation, but these were eradicated in the early 1990s.

At high tide they retreat to dune slacks or nearby wetlands to spend their time preening and sleeping. Unfortunately, this sight is becoming less common, at least locally in southern Africa. Sanderling numbers in the Western Cape have decreased by 90% in the last 30 years. The main reason for this dramatic change appears to be a decrease in numbers rather than a change in their migration routes or wintering areas.</p><p>Sanderlings are one of the world’s great travellers, breeding on the high Arctic tundra with a near circumpolar distribution. During the non-breeding season they disperse to shorelines around the world, reaching southern South America, South Africa and Australia, although some remain as far north as California and Scotland. The birds visiting southern Africa come from two populations. Most come from the Siberian population, east to at least the Taymyr Peninsula and possibly as far east as the Lena River, whereas smaller numbers derive from the north-east Canadian-Greenland population. This latter population may only disperse as far south as Namibia, where there has been a recent spate of sightings of individually marked birds from Greenland and points along that population’s migration route. Some of this population also winter in Western Europe.</p><p>Sanderlings are one of the world’s great travellers, breeding on the high Arctic tundra with a near circumpolar distribution.

Evidence from ringed birds suggest that some east coast migrants reach the Western Cape and Namibia. They may undertake a loop migration, with birds fattening up on the west coast prior to migrating north again. In fact, ringing recoveries suggest that few, if any, birds, use the east coast route on the northward migration.</p><p>Migrants arrive from early September until late November, with young birds arriving later. They disperse widely around the coasts of the region, but prior to fattening for the return migration many birds move to favoured foraging sites on the west coast. At Walvis Bay, numbers increase considerably from late January, reaching densities of up to four birds per metre of beach over hundreds of metres. Departure takes place in April-May, but most first-year birds remain for their first austral winter. The total number visiting southern Africa in the 1980s was about 85&#160;000, a substantial proportion of the global population of some 270&#160;000 birds.</p>",

Few of the young of the year reach us before February or March, having loitered at sites ranging from West Africa south to Angola. Once in southern Africa this species remains extremely mobile and moves around the coast as far east as southern Mozambique. The areas of major concentration differ annually, with no real pattern being evident. Peak numbers may occur in Namibia one year, yet in other years in the Western or Eastern Cape. These movements are likely to be food related. Movement around the coastline can be rapid – a bird ringed in the Eastern Cape one January was recovered 850 km away in northern KwaZulu-Natal eighteen days later. Although spread out around the coastline, the bird favours more sheltered embayments such as Walvis Bay, Sandwich Harbour, False Bay, St Francis Bay and Nelson Mandela Bay, as well as some of the larger river mouths.</p><p>Feeding takes place mainly inshore, usually within a couple of kilometres of the coastline, although birds may, on occasion, move further offshore, especially when favoured prey such as anchovy are available. Some birds will also feed a few kilometres up larger estuaries, mainly on mullet, and there is one record of a bird at a farm dam in the Western Cape. Feeding frenzies, with other terns involved, may also be witnessed at the mouths of rivers when large shoals of mullet are on the move.</p><p>Feeding takes place mainly inshore, usually within a couple of kilometres of the coastline, although birds may, on occasion, move further offshore, especially when favoured prey such as anchovy are available.

Feeding frenzies, with other terns involved, may also be witnessed at the mouths of rivers when large shoals of mullet are on the move.</p><p>Because of its mobility, estimating the numbers reaching our shores is difficult. It is likely that about 10-15&#160;000 birds visit in a good year, and probably less than 10&#160;000 birds in a poor year. This is only a small proportion of the estimated 200&#160;000 plus birds occurring in Western Europe. Other populations breed around the Black and Caspian Seas but do not normally visit us (although there are single ring recoveries from each of these localities): these birds winter in the Mediterranean and north-west Indian Ocean respectively. Other races breed in North and South America. A couple of ringed North American birds have been recorded in Europe, but none has been found in Africa.</p><p>Migration patterns are difficult to discern because the birds migrate in small groups, either during the day or at night, and at considerable altitude. Fluctuating daily numbers at any site certainly give the impression of continuous movement. At Lambert’s Bay, a migratory stopover site where birds only spend a short time, southward moving birds in October arrived from about 22h00 hours, indicating that they had probably left earlier from the Orange River mouth. On northward migration, at the same site, parties would arrive then rest for a short time in the morning, possibly having left earlier that morning from further south at St Helena Bay, a popular night-time roost site during northward migration. The earlier moving birds carry a smaller migratory fat load than those leaving later in the season, indicating that the latter are in a greater hurry and fly longer distances at each hop along the coast.</p><p>All adults have departed by early April but small numbers of immatures remain through the austral winter with occasional concentrations of up to 250 along the west coast. Very few youngsters remain on the east and south coasts. Ring recoveries indicate that most of the birds remaining behind in winter are one or two years old, but some are as much as five years old.</p>",

Juvenile birds have a horn-coloured bill, and the moustache stripes are not yet obvious.  Usually in small groups of up to 20 birds, they perch prominently on small trees, with their high-pitched contact calls drawing attention to their presence. Roosting together is a life-saver on the cold winter nights of the arid interior of southern Africa. Yet despite up to a dozen birds gathering in specially-constructed roost nests of dry grass, birds occasionally die during unseasonal cold snaps.  They sometimes also roost in unoccupied Sociable Weaver nests. In arid savannas from Tanzania north and westwards, the Scaly-feathered Finch has a sister species, the Speckle-fronted Weaver S. frontalis, in which the moustachial stripes are broken up by white spots, and the crown pattern is different.</p><p>The Scaly-feathered Finch is typical of dry acacia veld, avoiding broad-leaved woodlands where these occur alongside acacia savanna. Thus in areas like the Mountain Zebra National Park, they are common in the open dry grasslands with scattered thorn trees to the north, but absent from the mountains and more densely vegetated valleys of the southern sector. It is one of the desert-adapted bird species that can produce its own water even on a diet of dry seeds, and has no need to drink for weeks on end.  Wild-caught birds survived more than 60 days without access to water, although they soon gained weight when given access to water. Small seeds are collected chiefly on the ground, but they also eat insects such as termites when they are available. They are very ‘busy’ feeders with the birds moving around relatively quickly as they search for seeds.

This suggests that they may form long-term pair bonds, which has been reported in captive birds. Yet we know little of their pair formation or survival under natural conditions. As in the sparrow-weavers, the nest is built of long grass stems which are bent, but not woven or knotted together. The nest chamber is warmly lined with grass heads, often green when first placed in the nest. The entrance is at the side, often projecting like a spout, and the rather bulky structure is typically placed in the thin outer branches of a thorn tree. Despite this, many nests seem to be destroyed by predators. Occasionally the birds occupy an old weaver nest, or may roof over the cup nest of another species. When breeding, a nest is occupied by a single pair, and although only the female incubates the eggs, both adults share feeding the young.</p>",

The reason for the low capture rate of these birds in mist nets is that they spend much of their time at higher levels in or just below the forest canopy.</p><p>Guiding behaviour has not been observed in Scaly-throated Honeyguides, and it would be hard, even for a very able-bodied human, to follow one of these honeyguides any distance in their preferred habitat. However, they are alleged to monitor Greater Honeyguides when one of those birds is leading a person to a bees’ nest. Because a Scaly-throated Honeyguide is likely to know the location of any bees’ nest within its normal home range (which is likely to be several square kilometres in extent), the purpose of such behaviour is surely not to locate the bees’ nest, but rather to be present if the guiding leads to the successful plundering of honeycomb.</p><p>It is the beeswax, as well as the bee brood, that is the attraction for honeyguides, as demonstrated recently by a resident of Gillitts, KwaZulu-Natal, who has been putting beeswax into his garden bird-food tray for two years. As a result, he has the three local honeyguides (Greater, Lesser and Scaly-throated) regularly visiting his feeder. Most animals are unable to digest wax, but honeyguides host specialised bacteria of the species Micrococcus cerolyticus in their stomachs, which digests the wax for the honeyguide. Of course they also take other forms of food, primarily insects such as caterpillars, beetles, flies and aphids. Wax is presumably a special treat whenever they can get it.</p><p>Like the other honeyguides, the Scaly-throated is a brood parasite of woodpeckers and barbets, with the forest-dwelling Olive Woodpecker being an oft-used host. Recent photographs taken near Pafuri show one of these honeyguides being fed by a female Bennett’s Woodpecker, a species not previously recorded as a host. &#9;</p>",

To the north it ranges to Eritrea and across West Africa to Senegal. It is locally common in the east, becoming thinly distributed in the west.</p><p>In Zimbabwe it is widespread and common, especially on the Masho&#173;naland highveld, but tends to be scarce or absent on the Kalahari Sandveld, and in drier areas of the south and southwest and many of the Eastern Districts, although in the latter it may be encroaching in areas where habitat alteration suits its requirements.

They have also benefited from the variety of indigenous and exotic trees and bushes that have been planted in urban and rural gardens.</p><p>During the winter months there is much local nomadic movement of highveld birds and also some degree of easterly movement of birds from drier areas in the west. In years of extreme drought, as in 1987, birds irrupted from the west over much of Zimbabwe in mid/late winter and specimens of the Namibian race, saturatior, were captured at one ringing site. In normal to dry years most of the small Namibian population is absent during the winter, but they do not seem to travel as far as Zimbabwe and they probably mix with the scattered Botswana populations which are concentrated along drainage lines. The normal winter wanderings of this species are unpredictable; ringed Zimbabwean birds have been recovered from 25 to 360 kilometres from the aforementioned ringing site.</p><p>Like the southern Amethyst Sunbird, this sunbird is often closely associated with man during its breeding season and may even hang its nest from suitable sites around the outside of the house. As with most, if not all sunbirds, breeding duties appear to be the domain of the female, from nest-building through incubation to rearing of the young, although the male will assist in feeding the chicks and fledglings.</p><p>Problems arise with identification of females and young between these two closely related species where the two overlap in range. The first characteristic to look for is the bastard wing or alula, which in this species is partly or wholly white, but is totally brown in the Amethyst Sunbird. Always be careful with throat colour as at certain light angles the plum-coloured throat of the Amethyst may appear red, although never as bright a scarlet nor as extensive as in the present species. The supercilium of the Amethyst extends backwards from above the eye whilst that of the Scarlet-chested is complete from the bill to well behind the eye. The males of both species assume the throat colouration of the adult while still in otherwise juvenile plumage, but complete moult into adult plumage takes place from the latter part of their first year into early second year.</p>",

Indeed one almost expects a Sclater’s Lark to hop into view in one of these images as the first life form discovered on our celestial neighbour. It is little wonder that these larks have been characterised as ‘hatched in hell’ on soils that can reach a blistering 50°C in the full glare of summer.</p><p>The most distinct features of this lark are its heavy, pale and slightly upturned bill, giving it a big-headed appearance, and the black teardrop marking below the eye. It shares this robust beak with the Large-billed Lark and the thick-billed forms of the Sabota Lark, which also use these powerful tools to chisel out food from this hard-baked, boulder-strewn landscape.

Sclater’s Lark also flips over stones with its beak when searching for insects. A favourite food is the seeds of the Eight-day Grass Enneapogon desvauxii, which this species seems particularly reliant on.</p><p>The breeding habits of Sclater’s Lark have attracted the attention of many observers. Phil Hockey and Ian Sinclair provided the first published description of a nest found in Bushmanland in 1980. Peter Steyn and Nico Myburgh followed up this initial discovery and studied many nests in the Brandvlei region. Penn Lloyd is the most recent student drawn to the challenges presented by this bird.</p><p>Breeding typically occurs in winter. This is the driest time of the year but it is when harvester termites, the favourite prey provisioned to chicks, are most active during the day. Small pebbles, over 250 in one instance, are used to build the apron around the nest. Nests are positioned on bare ground well away from any vegetation. This is apparently to reduce the risk of predation from medium-sized mammals, such as mongooses and polecats, which apparently have become more common in commercial stock-farming areas where larger predators have been mostly eradicated.</p><p>Unique to the genus, indeed larks generally, only a single egg is laid. The reason for this has been the subject of conjecture. The egg does not seem disproportionately large relative to the size of the adult. Nor does it have an incubation period different to that of other Spizocorys larks, and the resultant chick leaves the nest at about the same age as its congeners. It may simply reflect the general impoverishment of its setting, such that there are at best resources for only a single offspring at a time. Alternatively, it might be related to the need to shade the chick from direct sunlight for long periods in the exposed nest positions chosen, which limits the amount of food that can be brought in. Or possibly it is a retort to high predation rates on nests, allowing quicker renesting after such losses. Finally, it could just be a strategy that facilitates the fastest response to highly ephemerally suitable breeding conditions prompted by localised rainfall. The answer remains elusive.</p><p>The recently hatched chick closely resembles a cluster of dried grass seeds, and pebbles may be placed in the nest cup at hatching to further help camouflage it. A brooding adult may sit so tight over the chick that a human observer can touch it. On one occasion at Brandvlei, a local deluge (16 mm in nine minutes) completely destroyed all the nests with eggs and young.</p><p>Sclater’s Larks drink regularly, at least daily, and their nests therefore need to be constructed within commuting distance of water, which at Brandvlei was within 800 m. Artificial watering points in the Karoo have doubtless benefited the species in this regard.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Secretarybird is probably the most renowned and unusual raptor occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and it is quite unlike any other bird of prey in the world. It is the sole member of its own family, Sagittaridae, and is crane-like in appearance, standing about 1.3 m tall, with long legs, a long neck and a long tail – only its eagle-like bill, and much of its behaviour, give away its Accipitriforme lineage. Its unusualness has captured public imagination too, for it appears regularly on the postage stamps of African countries, and two nations, including South Africa, have incorporated it into their coats of arms.</p><p>How the bird came to be called a Secretarybird is often attributed to the spray of feathers protruding behind its head resembling quill pens stuck in the wig of a nineteenth-century clerk. This may be so, but a more compelling explanation of its origin is from the French word secretaire which is derived from Arabic saqu ettair meaning ‘hunter bird’.</p><p>How the bird came to be called a Secretarybird is often attributed to the spray of feathers protruding behind its head resembling quill pens stuck in the wig of a nineteenth-century clerk. This may be so, but a more compelling explanation of its origin is from the French word secretaire which is derived from Arabic saqu ettair meaning ‘hunter bird’.</p><p>One’s usual encounter with a Secretarybird is to see it walking purposefully across the veld, its head, and especially the ‘tassel’ of feathers on the nape, rising and falling with each step. Walking in this way; steadily at two or three kilometres an hour, it may cover 20 or 30 kilometres per day. At intervals the bird’s pace may quicken, or it may pause to investigate a spot on the ground more closely. If the object of interest is something relatively inert like a grasshopper or nestling bird it leans forward and snatches it up in its bill, then swallows it. Or it might perform a small dance, using its feet to immobilise a rodent or lizard that has fled into a grass tuft. Larger prey, especially snakes, may need prolonged foot-stamping before being rendered edible, and they too are swallowed whole. Its diet comprises virtually any live prey that it can overpower and swallow, but grasshoppers and rodents, not snakes as folklore would suggest, make up the bulk.</p><p>Secretarybirds favour open country with not too many trees around to hamper their mobility. In fact, provided there are occasional trees or bushes to provide suitable sites for nesting and roosting, these birds fare best in open grasslands, and the mesic grasslands of the eastern highveld are where the birds occur most commonly. They also range across the savanna belt, frequenting plains away from hills and mountains and where tree density is not too high, and they extend widely but sparsely into the arid Karoo. There is widespread evidence of their numbers having declined, and for this reason they’ve recently been added to the international red data list as a Vulnerable species. Causes of the decline are attributed to habitat loss, poisoning and hunting.</p><p>It is during the course of the breeding cycle that Secretarybirds reveal their bird of prey roots. As part of courtship one or both members of the pair soar high in the air, much resembling an eagle or vulture, and one or both birds then perform an eagle-like penduluming display in which the bird makes a shallow dive, then veers upward, stalls, and dives again, repeating this, and at intervals uttering a hoarse croak. It is one of the few times that these birds are ever heard making a sound.</p><p>Pairs defend large territories, usually about 50-100 square kilometres in extent, from which other Secretarybirds are excluded, and they have one or a few favoured nesting and/or roosting trees to which they return each night. Nest trees are invariably densely branched and foliaged, and a large shallow platform of sticks is built on top, open to the elements, and sometimes covering the entire crown of the tree. In semi-arid areas the nest may only be two or three metres off the ground, but it can be much higher in wetter areas. Both sexes build the nest and both add a thick lining of dry grass to the cup before the clutch of two or three large, plain white eggs is laid.</p><p>Another eagle-like trait is that the incubation is done largely by the female and she is fed at intervals on the nest by the male. Food is brought to the female and later to the nestlings in the crop, and it is disgorged onto the floor of the nest. Respective incubation and nestling periods are about 43 and about 85 days, and fledged young may remain as a family group for several months after fledging. Once the young disperse they may wander widely; one ringed being recovered four months later 1500 kilometres away.</p>",

Similarly, more musical males have less blood parasites. In turn, females choose to mate with males that have more complex songs; such males also obtain mates at earlier dates in the breeding season than their competitors.

However, distinguishing warbler songs is challenging. Sedge Warblers’ songs are recognisable by their hurried tempo, varied structure and buzzy tone. They sing most intensely just before returning to their Palaearctic breeding grounds; at other times, they can be located by their creaking or scolding calls.</p><p>Sedge Warblers breed in the northern summer in Europe and central Asia, and spend the non-breeding season in sub-Saharan Africa. They arrive in southern Africa mainly in late November and December. Here they undergo a complete moult, taking some 60-70 days between January and early April. Many arrive before the main rains, when habitat availability is limited, but disperse more widely later in summer. Their March or April departure back to the breeding grounds is abrupt and synchronised across the region.</p><p>This species shows a preference for short, emergent vegetation, favouring ephemeral grasses, sedges, weeds and herbaceous plants growing in shallow water or on mud. It is fond of flooded grasslands, seasonal vleis, floodplains and the margins of pans, lakes, dams and sewage settling ponds, but is less prone to enter extensive reed beds than other warblers. Sedge Warblers may also forage in shrubbery and weeds at the waterside, while transient birds may be found in drier vegetation away from water.</p><p>The Sedge Warbler spends more time in the open than its congeners, and sometimes hops about on floating vegetation or exposed mud in search of insects, spiders and other small invertebrates. Most foraging is done at dusk and dawn when lower temperatures make their prey more lethargic. They are quick to exploit local concentrations of food, especially to fatten up before migration; impressive numbers gather at concentrations of aphids or midges, for example.</p><p>With an estimated global population of more than 20 million, the Sedge Warbler is not considered threatened. However, severe decreases in parts of their European breeding range have been noted. These are likely attributable to droughts in the Sahel region of Africa, expansion of the Sahara desert (a major migration obstacle) and continued loss of wetlands. The yearly mortality rate for adults has been calculated at 50-87%, and 75-90% for first-year birds, and the maximum recorded age is ten years.&#9;</p>",

They are seldom found far from scrubby thickets in open woodlands, often where rounded boulders and balancing rocks occur.</p><p>Senegal Coucals are not strong flyers but are remarkably agile on the ground. In flight they appear to be unbalanced and have to flap quite hard to keep themselves airborne. Watching them in the woodland, they often run up a tree and then glide down to the next bush. In our garden they used to spend most of the day on the ground under overhanging vegetation, particularly thicker bushes, where they hunted for food on the ground. At the first sign of danger the coucals would hop up into the bush and silently disappear. They fed on insects and probably also earthworms if they were on the surface. They are mobbed by small birds because they are well known as predators of small birds’ eggs and chicks. However, because they usually keep to deep cover, other birds do not normally spot them.</p><p>Senegal Coucals use coarse grass to build a fairly large ball-shaped nest with an entrance on the side. This nest could be almost anywhere from thick bush to an open tree. There is often a perch adjacent to the nest which the adults use when entering or leaving the nest. When the chicks are large, they come to the nest entrance and are fed by the adult from this adjacent perch. We noticed that despite the visibility of the nest when placed in a tree, the adults were usually successful in rearing chicks. This is presumably because of special adaptations of the chicks for survival. If the nest is approached, the chicks hiss and growl rather like a snake or a small dog. If one puts one’s hand into the nest the chicks turn around and send out a jet of foul-smelling excreta which is remarkably difficult to remove. One cannot imagine a predator eating a chick which has just doused it with the foul-smelling liquid that they eject! Carl Vernon records that when danger threatens, the chicks leave the nest long before they can fly. They are able to do this because their legs are already well developed and they can run away through the grass if necessary, returning to the nest once danger has passed. &#9;</p>",

There is a separate population that occurs at a few sites from western Nigeria to Senegal. This is a dry-land wader that makes considerable seasonal movements within its range. This makes it difficult to estimate population sizes, but the global population is thought to number fewer than 70&#160;000 birds.</p><p>In southern Africa, most Senegal Lapwings occur at altitudes below 300 m, although some wander to higher altitudes during the dry season. They favour open woodlands, savanna and short grasslands, ground cleared for cultivation, farmland, pastures, sports fields and airfields as well as open ground close to large lakes and rivers. They particularly favour areas that have been burnt or heavily grazed, including such areas in woodlands. They move considerable distances in search of these habitats, making their occurrence rather unpredictable. Usually found singly or in family parties, more rarely they gather in groups of up to 20 individuals. The species is thought to be decreasing in southern Africa due to destruction of its woodland habitat for agriculture.</p><p>In southern Africa, most Senegal Lapwings occur at altitudes below 300 m, although some wander to higher altitudes during the dry season.

In flight, the Senegal Lapwing has a white trailing edge to the wing, whereas the larger Black-winged Lapwing has a white wing-bar. The other differences are slight and variable dependent on age and sex, but the Black-winged has relatively short legs, a greyer head and breast, and more white on the forehead of the adult.</p><p>In some parts of its range the Senegal Lapwing is highly migratory, but in southern Africa it tends to be nomadic or locally migratory. It does, occasionally, wander extensively, hence a record from Hwange National Park in western Zimbabwe. In KwaZulu-Natal it arrives in late winter to breed, departing in December or January as the grass becomes too tall. It is a regular non-breeding summer visitor to Kruger National Park, where it also breeds. In Zimbabwe it may be found year-round although it tends to be most common late in the dry season.</p><p>Senegal Lapwings normally breed in small, loose colonies, occasionally singly. Three or four eggs are laid in a slight scrape or ungulate hoofprint, with clutches being largest in years of high rainfall. Most incubation is done by the female, but the male plays an increasing role as temperatures rise. The male also maintains a small territory around the nest and warns of any impending danger. If a neighbouring male trespasses he is repelled by the territory owner, running at the intruder with feathers raised and neck slightly retracted. Once the chicks hatch they are cared for by both parents.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Sentinel Rock Thrush is one of many southern African endemic birds about which surprisingly little is known. It is the commonest rock thrush in the eastern highlands of Lesotho and adjacent Drakensberg north to southern Mpumalanga, but is patchy and local elsewhere in its range, usually being outnumbered by the larger and more robust Cape Rock Thrush. In areas where they occur together it is not at all clear how these species differ ecologically, if at all. In the Cape at least, Sentinel Rock Thrushes appear to reside in an area for a year or two then disappear, whereas Cape Rock Thrushes tend to be more predictable, long-term residents.</p><p>Sentinel Rock Thrushes are structurally most similar to the Short-toed Rock Thrush, and separation of the two species has to be done with care where their ranges overlap locally in the North West Province, Gauteng and Mpumalanga, especially as males of the pretoriae subspecies of Short-toed Rock Thrush in this area have the pale crown greatly reduced or absent, compared to the nominate form illustrated in most field guides.</p><p>Sentinel Rock Thrushes are structurally most similar to the Short-toed Rock Thrush, and separation of the two species has to be done with care where their ranges overlap locally in the North West Province, Gauteng and Mpumalanga, especially as males of the pretoriae subspecies of Short-toed Rock Thrush in this area have the pale crown greatly reduced or absent, compared to the nominate form illustrated in most field guides.</p><p>Sentinel Rock Thrushes are monogamous and territorial, with males advertising their location from elevated song posts. Historically these have mainly been rocks or termite mounds, but they happily use man-made structures, including telephone poles. At the height of the mating season they also call in short song flights, fluttering about 10 metres into the air then descending to a favoured perch, singing throughout. Their songs are less stereotyped than those of the Cape Rock Thrush, which can be a useful way to differentiate the two species from a distance.</p><p>Once a pair bond is established, the female builds the nest, while the male (in typical male fashion) encourages her with yet more singing. The nest is a bulky affair of roots and fibrous vegetation, built under a stone on the ground or in a rock crevice, with the same site often being used in successive years. The two sexes of Sentinel Rock Thrushes typically are quite distinct, but this is not always the case. One breeding pair that raised a chick seemingly comprised two ‘males’. On closer inspection, one was a bit dowdier than the other, with slight mottling on the orange breast, and was assumed to be the female</p><p>Once the nest is complete, the female lays two or three pale blue eggs that only she incubates. The chicks hatch after about two weeks, and remain in the nest, being fed predominantly by the female for a further two and a half weeks. After fledging, the young remain in the vicinity of the nest for several more weeks, being fed sporadically by at least the female, before finally dispersing. Their movements are poorly understood. Some birds in the east of the range move to lower elevations in winter, but others remain on the heights of the Drakensberg year-round. Elsewhere, individuals appear to wander occasionally, and not just young birds. Adult males have turned up in the West Coast National Park, well outside their normal range. Two subspecies of Sentinel Rock Thrush have been described, with the Drakensberg one being restricted to the mountains.</p><p>Numbers of Sentinel Rock Thrushes appear to have decreased in the west of their range over the last couple of decades, but the reasons for this decrease are unknown. It was never a common bird on the Cape Peninsula, and its decline there, if indeed it has decreased, is nowhere near as marked as that exhibited by the Cape Rock Thrush. It remains common in the core of its range and is not considered threatened.</p>",

However, they are inconspicuous in non-breeding plumage, and thus the apparent po&#173;pulation fluctuations in many areas, presumably related to movements during the dry season, are poorly understood since the birds can be easily overlooked in mixed flocks of whydahs and other small seedeaters. This species drinks when water is available, but seems able to go without access to water for long periods. Combined with the Vidua technique of scratching up buried seeds, this pre-adapts it for life in the arid sector of southern Africa.</p><p>Male Shaft-tailed Whydahs sing from a high (typically above four metres) call site, and defend the immediate area against other males. Favoured call sites may be used in successive years, and are quickly occupied by other birds if the incumbent is removed or dies. The song includes chattering whydah elements, and mimicry of its primary brood host, the Violet-eared Waxbill (in Namibia some males mimic songs of the Black-faced Waxbill). Neighbouring males may be less than 100 m apart, and they share the same song types, which show regional variation or ‘song dialects’. Tail length seems to be a key element in male success, and in natural populations this appears to depend primarily on the date and stage of plumage development in individual birds, as there is not a great deal of individual variation in the lengths of full-grown tails. When a female perches within a male’s territory, he hovers above her for several minutes, jerking his tail, or perches nearby, fluttering his wings.</p><p>Male Shaft-tailed Whydahs sing from a high (typically above four metres) call site, and defend the immediate area against other males.

Even though female Shaft-tailed Whydahs often remove and eat a host egg, some observers have seen the brood parasite enter an occupied nest, and apparently lay their egg without interference from the incubating waxbill. More than one female may lay in the same nest. Each female lays eggs daily in batches of 3-4 eggs, equivalent to a clutch for other birds, but can lay several clutches, each separated by a few days’ rest. The parasite and host young are often raised successfully together. The main host species is the Violet-eared Waxbill, with the whydah nestlings matching the mouth markings of this species, while in Namibia the Black-faced Waxbill is the regular host for some individual whydahs, and in South Africa the Blue Waxbill has also been parasitised. Hybrids with indigobirds have been recorded; breeding males are entirely black-plumaged, with the characteristic long tail feathers of the Shaft-tailed Whydah, causing confusion with the East African Steel-blue Whydah V. hypocherina. Since male whydahs and indigobirds often display to other species, hybridisation presumably results from females accepting the advances of a male of another species.</p>",

They are seldom abundant, probably due to habitat quality, because the same coveys persist in precisely the same areas year after year without exploiting the intervening landscape.</p><p>They prefer open grasslands, wooded savannas, thornveld and open miombo and mopane woodlands, often on stony terrain or among rocky outcrops. The habitat separation between them, Red-winged Francolin and Orange River Francolin, is distinct. Shelley’s Francolins prefer taller sweetveld in the east, whereas Red-winged Francolins inhabit shorter sourveld and Orange River Francolins occur in the drier, tall, sparse grasslands of western southern Africa. Shelley’s Francolins also often occur alongside Coqui and Crested Francolins, and Swainson’s and Natal Spurfowls.</p><p>Shelley’s Francolins are usually found in pairs or small coveys of 6-8 birds, which sit tight when approached. However, they will also run through grasslands to avoid being flushed. Coveys are localised and probably territorial. Where the home range includes wetlands, they will often use these marshes and sponges to roost. Like most other francolins, they tend to fly rather than walk to their overnight roosting sites, thus avoiding being tracked by predators. They are more likely to use the edges of cultivated lands than are Red-winged and Grey-winged Francolins, but, like most francolins, do not regularly use farmlands.</p><p>Their characteristic call comprises two low notes followed by two higher notes, ‘I’ll drink YER BEER’, repeated three or four times, usually from a vantage point such as a termite mound or rock. This call is similar to that of the Orange River Francolin but the spacing of the notes is more deliberate, and the call is slower. They also have a shrill call given when flushed.</p><p>Their feeding behaviour of digging for corms and bulbs with their bill is similar to that of other grassland francolins. The diet is varied, consisting of corms, bulbs, seeds and grains in winter and supplemented with invertebrates during summer.</p><p>They are monogamous, solitary nesters, with the breeding season differing markedly between the northern and southern populations. In South Africa, peak nesting occurs during summer (October to January), while in Zimbabwe breeding is extended, lasting from August to June, with peaks during September and October and during March and April. The nest is a fairly deep scrape in dense grassland or under a bush, well lined with grass and roots. The clutch of 4-5 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 20-22 days and, as in other francolins, the incubating hen sits very tight, particularly late in incubation. The chicks can flutter-fly at 12 days and can fly strongly at five weeks.</p><p>Although this francolin is not threatened in southern Africa, its occurrence is affected by grassland deterioration resulting from continuous grazing by domestic livestock and excessive burning. Fires in these grasslands also destroy both nests and chicks, and expose nesting sites to severe hailstorms.</p>",

It occurs both in Indio-Malaysia and Africa, and the unusual name is derived from shikari, a hunter in Hindu. The bird’s very wide distribution has resulted in several races occurring, those in southern Africa (Accipiter badius polyzonoides) being recognisable by some scattered white spots showing on the adult bird’s upperwing coverts. Shikras are less dimorphic than other accipiters, females being only marginally larger than males – they have proportionately shorter legs and toes than other accipiters – and males, with red eyes, are distinguishable from females with yellow or orange eyes.</p><p>It has been suggested that the local population of Shikras is at least partly migratory, but my own monthly counts of the birds over many years indicate their fairly even presence in all months of the year. They were infrequent visitors to the birdbaths in the garden and this, curiously, was seasonal, being confined to the months March to July. In the farmlands around Nylsvley Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province many homesteads had, until the mid-1980s, mature copses of eucalypts alongside, trees which presumably had been planted in the distant past to provide an at-hand source of building material. These plantations proved a magnetic attraction for nesting accipiters, including Shikras, and over a number of years I systematically monitored the nesting activity in 18-20 such sites.</p><p>It has been suggested that the local population of Shikras is at least partly migratory, but my own monthly counts of the birds over many years indicate their fairly even presence in all months of the year.

These plantations proved a magnetic attraction for nesting accipiters, including Shikras, and over a number of years I systematically monitored the nesting activity in 18-20 such sites.</p><p>Shikras were usually the commonest nesting accipiter, with up to eight pairs nesting in the different copses that I monitored in a season, but Black, Ovambo and Little Sparrowhawks all bred in them as well, the three smaller species often sharing a stand with the Shikras. Shikras began frequenting the vicinity of the future nest early in September when their calling alerted one to their presence, males uttering a metallic, two-syllable ‘kli-vit’ which they repeated at intervals, and females responding with a more plaintive note, ‘teee-uuu’, which they also repeated. Both sexes built the nest and one I took apart, after breeding was over, comprised 602 items, all collected from near the nest and brought to it, one by one. These birds characteristically line their nest with pieces of dry bark, and in this nest nearly a third of the total were pieces of bark. Shikras make a third danger-warning call, a shrill, oft-repeated ‘tu-wi, tu-wi, tu-wi’…. One bird calling this way immediately summoned its mate back to the nest.</p><p>In the mid-1980s, a ‘Working for Water’ programme got underway in the district, and one of the goals of the project was to remove alien trees that were impacting water flow along watercourses. One by one, the copses of eucalypts were felled, and the numbers of breeding accipiters in the area diminished. Some, like the small Shikra probably reverted to nesting in savanna trees, albeit less successfully, but others, like the much larger Black Sparrowhawk, essentially disappeared.</p><p>The Shikra is certainly the least rapacious of the four accipiters listed here and lizards (85) much outnumbered birds (27) in a sample of 119 prey items that I recorded being brought to various nests. The sample also included two mice, four dragonflies, a frog and termites. Their hunting technique is to watch the surroundings from an elevated perch and swoop down when prey is sighted, probably taking most of these items on the ground rather than in flight; lizards sunning themselves on tree trunks are living dangerously when there are Shikras around! Much like other accipiters the male does the bulk of the hunting during the nesting cycle, and he brings prey to his mate at intervals during the day. She, by contrast, remains at or close to the nest and undertakes virtually all of the incubation.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Short-toed Rock Thrush is the only rock thrush found in the mostly arid and semi-arid parts of southern Africa, and its range extends marginally into south-western Angola. In these areas, it is readily identified, but in the east of its range, in the North West Province, Gauteng and Mpumalanga, its range overlaps locally with that of the similar Sentinel Rock Thrush. Great care has to be exercised when separating the two species in this area, because males of the eastern pretoriae subspecies of Short-toed Rock Thrush have the pale crown greatly reduced or absent compared to the nominate form that is illustrated in most field guides. Short-toed Rock Thrushes are smaller bodied than Sentinel Rock Thrushes, with slightly longer tails and appreciably shorter legs. Also, the blue throat of the male does not extend as far onto the breast, and the female typically is paler beneath.</p><p>There has been some debate about the status of the two forms of Short-toed Rock Thrush, with suggestions that the eastern form might represent a separate species. However, the two forms apparently intergrade locally in the Northern Cape and western Free State. What is clear is that the species has a distinctly patchy distribution, with its main base in central Namibia and subsidiary centres in central South Africa and south-east Botswana, but also some outlying populations such as around Beaufort West and along the lower Orange River. The situation is further complicated by post-breeding movements; many birds apparently move to lower ground from the interior to avoid freezing winter temperatures.</p><p>There has been some debate about the status of the two forms of Short-toed Rock Thrush, with suggestions that the eastern form might represent a separate species.

The situation is further complicated by post-breeding movements; many birds apparently move to lower ground from the interior to avoid freezing winter temperatures.</p><p>Short-toed Rock Thrushes are visual foragers, often dropping from a perch or bounding over the ground to catch their prey. In addition to a wide diversity of insects and other invertebrates they also occasionally catch and kill geckos and other small lizards, which are beaten to death on a convenient rock. They can become tame and confiding around farm houses.</p><p>Like other rock thrushes, the male advertises by singing from a prominent perch, often including mimetic elements into its varied song. The female builds the nest, which is a deep, bulky affair, built on or close to the ground, usually under the shelter of an overhanging rock or other protection from above. The nest base is built from coarse twigs or pieces of bark and then covered with finer materials such as grasses in which the deep cup is formed. Quite why they need such a large structure is unclear. It might offer some insulation from the ground, but given the protected microsites they select for their nests, excessive heat or cold are unlikely to be major problems.</p><p>The clutch of two to four (usually three) plain blue or greenish-blue eggs is incubated by the female only. The male remains in close attendance and usually warns her of any approaching threats, whereupon she slips quietly off the nest. The chicks hatch after two weeks, and are fed by both parents. They grow quickly, and leave the nest about two and a half weeks after hatching but remain in the vicinity of the nest, being fed by both parents sporadically for another couple of weeks.</p><p>Short-toed Rock Thrushes used to occur as far east as the Le&#173;bombo Mountains near Bremersdorp in Swaziland, but this population appears to have disappeared. Elsewhere, most populations appear to be reasonably healthy, and it is not considered threatened.</p>",

In Mozambique, it is common and widespread north of the Save River; it occurs sparsely further south, extending to about Inharrime. However, during the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) birders targeting this species had to concentrate their efforts in eastern Zimbabwe. Here it was discovered at a school in Mutare and later in the Chipinge area, on the Katiyo Tea Estate and elsewhere in the eastern highlands.

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Shy Albatross is the largest of the mollymawks, intermediate in size between the great albatrosses and the smaller Thalassarche albatrosses. Its taxonomy is still debated, with anything from one to four species recognised, all of which occur off southern Africa. Most authorities agree that Salvin’s and Chatham Albatrosses are ‘good’ species, but the differences between Tasmania’s nominate Shy Albatross T. c. cauta and New Zealand’s White-capped Albatross T. c. steadi are minor. We treat them as a single species – Shy Albatross – not least because they are indistinguishable in the field. Genetic evidence indicates that Tasmanian birds make up only about 5% of the birds found in southern Africa, which is roughly half the proportion that would be expected if both forms were equally likely to reach the region. Of the many chicks ringed at the three Tasmanian colonies, only birds from one colony, Mewstone Island, have been recorded in southern Africa, and all of these were recovered within a year or two of fledging; it appears that almost all adult birds off southern Africa are New Zealand birds. Indeed, colour-dyed chicks from Tasmania have been recorded off southern Africa within two months of fledging. Satellite-tracking studies, funded in part by celebrity-sponsored bird races, show that birds travel against the prevailing westerlies across the southern Indian Ocean to reach the Cape.</p><p>Shy Albatrosses usually are the easiest albatross to see in the Cape, as they are largely confined to the continental shelf, and often come close to shore where they are visible from land. They are less common farther north, however, and are scarce off Namibia and KwaZulu-Natal. Although they are strongly attracted to fishing vessels, where they scavenge offal and discards, Shy Albatrosses also forage extensively on pelagic schooling fish including Anchovies, Sardines, Round Herrings, Horse Mackerels and Sauries. They sometimes make shallow plunge dives, and can dive down to 8 metres, using their wings and feet to propel them underwater after prey. As the largest species regularly occurring at fishing vessels, they tend to dominate feeding groups, charging over the water to displace smaller species from prey items. This can prove fatal when they scavenge behind longline vessels if they steal baited hooks from deeper-diving White-chinned Petrels.</p><p>Shy Albatrosses usually are the easiest albatross to see in the Cape, as they are largely confined to the continental shelf, and often come close to shore where they are visible from land.

They are also at risk when scavenging behind demersal hake trawlers, because their long wings get entangled in the trawl warps (the wires that tow the net). The force of the water moving past the warps is sufficient to gradually drag them underwater and drown. Fortunately once this problem was identified the industry swiftly adopted measures to exclude birds from the danger zone, and mortality rates decreased dramatically. Despite these causes of unnatural mortality on fishing gear, recent counts of the large New Zealand population suggest that their numbers are stable or even increasing, and unlike most albatrosses, the Shy Albatross is only listed as Near-threatened. A single bird was recently found incubating in the colony of Grey-headed and Indian Yellow-nosed Albatrosses on Prince Edward Island, making it the first breeding record outside Australasia.</p>",

Occupied throughout the year, nests provide shelter from both the extreme heat of summer and the frosty winter nights. On a bleak winter day with an icy wind, Peter Ginn found more than a hundred birds sheltering in a nest with only 30 chambers! One nest, close to a main route in the South African section of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, features in many books and magazine articles and might be the most-photographed bird’s nest on the continent. In this park the birds are very confiding at picnic areas and rest camps. The first published descriptions of the nests date back to the 18th century travels of the French ornithologist Levaillant and the Eng&#173;lish botanist Paterson (collecting succulent plants for Kew Gardens). After pioneering studies by Gordon Maclean, the Sociable Weaver has been the focus of recent research concerned with the co-operative interactions of the colony members.</p><p>The nest is a huge mass of dry grass stems, with the pointed ends projecting downwards. One nest may contain up to 95 individual nest chambers, and can weigh one ton; even large camel thorn trees may be unable to bear the weight, and branches bearing the nest break. Material is added to the nest throughout the year, with new chambers constructed mainly after rain. In treeless areas the provision of telephone poles led to an expansion in the range of Sociable Weavers. The material packed around the wires and insulators led to disruptions in telephone communication when it was wet.  A solution was found, by providing hanging baskets at a lower level, with some ‘seed’ material of dry grass placed in them. Now nests are appearing on electricity pylons.  Fortunately they are then typically below 4&#160;metres, so do not interfere with the cables; nests in trees are 3.5–7&#160;metres above ground.</p><p>The nest is a huge mass of dry grass stems, with the pointed ends projecting downwards.

Providing supplementary food at some colonies stimulated the birds to breed earlier. Although the mating system is monogamous, the pair often doesn’t stay together for more than one breeding attempt. Both sexes incubate the eggs and feed the young, with up to nine other birds (often older siblings) helping to feed the nestlings. Helpers seem to enhance the survival of the chicks when food is scarce. Predation by snakes is a major source of nestling mortality, with Cape Cobras Naja nivea resident in some nest masses, and checking the chambers periodically. Pygmy Falcons are also permanent tenants of many nests, and may occasionally take adults or nestlings, while providing some protection from snakes. Other birds, including Ashy Tits and Rosy-faced Lovebirds, sometimes occupy nest chambers for breeding or roosting, and raptors including vultures, Giant Eagle Owls and Bateleurs sometimes use the roof as a nesting platform.</p><p>Sociable Weavers feed on both seeds and insects, and they drink when water is available but can survive without drinking for extended periods. Most food is collected on the ground, and the birds generally forage within 2&#160;km of their home colony. Most birds remain in their natal colony or move no more than 4&#160;km, often to a colony of similar size although a few individuals have moved up to 30 km. Females are more likely to disperse. Sociable Weavers generally first breed at three years old, and some individuals in well-studied colonies are now more than 11 years old; recently a 16-year-old bird was recaptured at a Northern Cape colony.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Soft-plumaged Petrel is the smallest and arguably the most aerially dynamic of the gadfly petrels found in southern Africa.  Both its common and scientific names attest to its soft body plumage, which is evident in the hand. But it is at sea where it wins most admirers, thanks to its aerial acrobatics. It is normally seen singly or in pairs, soaring steeply up and down, and then suddenly embarking on a series of mad-cap antics, rolling onto its back, jinking and turning while accelerating with deep wing-beats. Such behaviour may deter would-be predators or kleptoparasites such as skuas from harassing the birds. Sometimes one encounters flocks of 10 or more, swirling and dancing over the water.</p><p>Soft-plumaged Petrels breed at an odd suite of islands: Tristan da Cunha and Gough in the central South Atlantic Ocean, the Prince Edwards, Crozets and Kerguelen in the southern Indian Ocean, the Antipodes off New Zealand, and a recently discovered small population on the Maatsuyker Islands off Tasmania. At one stage they were considered to be the same species as birds breeding at the Macaronesian islands in the north-east Atlantic, but these are now known to represent a separate radiation more closely allied to other North Atlantic gadfly petrels. Two subspecies are recognised within Soft-plumaged Petrels: the nominate race from the South Atlantic colonies is paler above than P. m. dubia from the Indian Ocean. Both occur in southern African waters, with a broad area of overlap south of the continent. There is also a rare dark morph. Early observers reported it to be common on Gough Island, but there are no recent records from there. I have personally only encountered it in the south-west Indian Ocean. It superficially resembles a Kerguelen Petrel, but is more slender, with longer wings and tail, and it retains vestiges of a darker ‘M’ shape across its upperparts. Most individuals also have a dark head that contrasts with a paler grey lower breast and belly.</p><p>Soft-plumaged Petrels breed at an odd suite of islands: Tristan da Cunha and Gough in the central South Atlantic Ocean, the Prince Edwards, Crozets and Kerguelen in the southern Indian Ocean, the Antipodes off New Zealand, and a recently discovered small population on the Maatsuyker Islands off Tasmania.

However, they occur year-round in oceanic waters south of 36ºS, typically favouring cooler waters (&lt;18ºC) than those preferred by Great-winged Petrels. They are scarce in calm weather over the continental shelf, but move onto the shelf in reasonable numbers in stormy weather, when they can even be seen from land. They feed mainly on squid, but also scavenge scraps from vessels provided there are few other birds in attendance.</p><p>Soft-plumaged Petrels breed in burrows and are completely nocturnal at their breeding islands, where their calls are one of the characteristic night sounds. In flight, they give a mournful, ghostly wailing ‘ooooooeeeee’, ascending in pitch. With hundreds of birds circling and calling at once, it makes for an unforgettable auditory experience. Sometimes two or more birds display in the air, flying in close formation, adding yipping calls to their repertoire. They give a quite different call from their burrows: a strident ‘ti-di-di-dee-dee-deeeeee’.</p><p>Introduced predators have affected populations at several breeding islands, including South Africa’s Marion Island. The largest population breeds on Gough Island, where House Mice Mus musculus are killing the chicks of many seabird species. Despite this, the population exceeds a million pairs and is not considered to be globally threatened.</p>",

Its kin are all sombre-looking, olive-coloured, forest-dwelling birds, many of them difficult to identify even in the hand, and often impossible to separate in the shadowy forest environment unless they call. The only visible distinguishing feature of the Sombre Greenbul is the ivory colour of its eye, and even this is missing in the juvenile bird, which has a brown eye.</p><p>But, like most dull-coloured forest birds, what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in voice. It isn’t one of Africa’s great songsters, but its whistled territorial advertisement is an unmistakable refrain, easily rendered in words as ‘Willie! Willie! Come-an-have-a fight. Scarrrrrrrrreddd!’. The ‘Willie’ whistles are loud and far-carrying, and in KwaZulu-Natal have earned it the colloquial names of Bush Willie or i-Wili. As with many wide-ranging birds, the call varies geographically. In the Western Cape, for example, there is often only one initial ‘Willie’ note, and the slurred ending is missing.</p><p>But, like most dull-coloured forest birds, what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in voice.

In the Western Cape, for example, there is often only one initial ‘Willie’ note, and the slurred ending is missing.</p><p>Sombre Greenbuls are covert birds that seldom show themselves, but when the breeding season gets under way, the males perch in exposed positions to advertise themselves and their territories. In the bush-clump woodland of river valleys in KwaZulu-Natal I have seen three such birds, each perched on the top of a bush, all within a 15 m diameter circle, challenging one another vociferously and all totally indifferent to my close approach.</p><p>Most of the time, however, the Sombre Greenbul seldom emerges from the foliage, (except in the early-morning sun of a cold day) and solitary males uttering their loud ‘Willie’ refrain usually do so from the depths of a bush or tree crown. One of the best places to get a good view of one is at a well-sited garden birdbath (one that has a leafy overhang above it), for they are regular drinkers, and are attracted to gardens that have fruiting trees. The bulk of their diet is made up of pea-sized drupes and berries, many of which are not nearly as juicy as larger fruits such as loquats and plums, so these greenbuls regularly visit gardens where ‘gourmet’ fruits are grown. In spite of this, they don’t have a bad name for damaging fruit, mainly because of their covert habits and nondescript appearance, and also because damage to fruit is usually blamed on their more demonstrative cousins, Cape and Dark-capped Bulbuls.</p><p>Insects are also part of the diet and probably make up most of the food supplied to nestlings. Sombre Greenbuls often hawk flying prey such as termite alates (flying ants), emerging from the cover of a bush to sally up and snatch an insect before diving back into cover again. They also eat small snails, leaves of succulent plants such as Senecio species, and nectar from aloe flowers. Reliance on fruit is paramount, however, and year–round residence by a Sombre Bulbul is a good indicator of continuous fruit availability in the area.</p><p>Although these greenbuls regularly visit water to drink, bathing is much less common, and to term it ‘bathing’ is almost an exaggeration. A bird will hop into a birdbath for only a split second before hopping out again and shivering its feathers rapidly when safely on a dry perch. This sequence may be repeated a few times, with only its belly feathers and tail becoming wetted. ‘Bathing’ in damp foliage has also been recorded, and on hot days these birds may make use of a water sprinkler that is wetting a bush or tree.</p>",

At their breeding grounds, they undertake much of their courtship in the air, giving their evocative calls and performing synchronised flights in an exquisite aerial ballet. On land they are extremely clumsy, so they breed on cliffs and ridges where they can land and take off directly at their nest sites. Both species are rare in southern African waters, with the more northerly breeding Sooty Albatross more common, occurring regularly in oceanic waters south of the continent. During severe storms they may be driven farther north, with vagrants reaching southern Mozambique. In the major seabird wreck of August 1984 one ended up on the ledge of a building in suburban Cape Town. Sooty Albatrosses breed at south temperate and sub-Antarctic islands in the South Atlantic and south Indian Oceans, overlapping with Light-mantled Albatrosses at the Prince Edwards, Crozets and Kerguelen. Their numbers have decreased in recent decades, mainly due to accidental mortality on fishing gear, and they are listed as Endangered.</p>",

They are particularly common in shelf waters, but also occur at low densities in oceanic waters. They have a vast range globally, ranging from Antarctica to the high latitudes of the north Atlantic and north Pacific Oceans; they are absent only from the tropical Indian Ocean. Their breeding grounds are on islands off south-east Australia, New Zealand, Cape Horn and the Falklands, with a few pairs on Tristan da Cunha. From these colonies they migrate across the Equator into the north Pacific and, to a lesser extent, the north Atlantic, as well as dispersing throughout the Southern Oceans. Several lines of evidence suggest that most Sooty Shearwaters off southern Africa are immatures or non-breeders, including the timing of moult (which is earlier than among breeding birds). Although they are most abundant in winter, most strandings occur in late summer, when birds are in heavy moult and their flight capability is compromised.</p><p>Like several other large shearwaters, Sooty Shearwaters are mainly brown, and they could be confused with White-chinned and even Great-winged Petrels. However, the combination of silvery underwings and a long slender, dark grey bill is diagnostic. From a distance, they are easily told from petrels by their straight wings and stiff flight action. Like most shearwaters, they alternate long glides with rapid bursts of flapping flight. As the wind speed increases, however, their flapping decreases, and in gales they soar as well as any petrel. They are often found in flocks, and frequently fly in lines during light winds, reminiscent of Cape Cormorants (although their flight action is quite different).</p><p>Like several other large shearwaters, Sooty Shearwaters are mainly brown, and they could be confused with White-chinned and even Great-winged Petrels.

They also catch prey by surface-seizing and surface plunge-diving. During deeper dives they zigzag during the initial period of descent, apparently to shake as much air from the plumage as possible, thereby reducing their buoyancy. Off southern Africa, their main prey is small fish, especially Anchovies, Lightfish and Lanternfish. They often feed in association with other predators, including Cape Fur Seals, dolphins and tunas, and large flocks up to 10 000 strong gather to feed together. They also scavenge discards at fishing vessels, but tend to avoid the dense scrum right behind a vessel. Instead, they use their diving ability to swim down, under the main flock, to obtain scraps that have sunk below the reach of other species.</p><p>Historically, large numbers of Sooty Shearwaters were caught for food by fishermen in southern Africa; fortunately this practice has now largely ceased. Large numbers are still killed either accidentally or deliberately by fisheries elsewhere in the world, and there is a legal harvest of chicks called muttonbirds’in some parts of New Zealand, despite local decreases in many populations. Introduced predators and human disturbance are significant impacts at some colonies, and it is speculated that changes in marine circulation patterns in the Pacific may also be contributing to population decreases. As a result, the species was recently listed as Near-threatened despite having a total population that still numbers in the millions.</p>",

Its iridescent all-black plumage is tinted with blue and purple, and the shoulders have a rich bronze sheen which gleams in the sunlight. The body feathering stops abruptly just below the throat and nape, ending in an odd-looking Victorian ruff that results in the head appearing smaller than it is. Adult birds have wrinkled white throats and faces, capped by a second unusual-looking feature, a waxy red-coloured cap much like a cyclist’s helmet; the bird’s name is derived from this. Because of their appearance, they are also known in farming areas where they occur by the Afrikaans name of ‘wildekalkoen’  (‘wild turkey’). The Sotho name is ‘mokhotlo’ and a village in Lesotho, Mokhotlong, is so named for their presence there.</p><p>Southern Bald Ibises are resident and largely sedentary, and live in open grasslands where the rainfall mostly exceeds 700 mm per annum.

Both are shorter-legged than other ibises; this is linked to their choice of habitat. They are not wading birds, but instead live in treeless grasslands, spending much of their time walking, scanning the ground for insects. Our southern species is dependent on areas where the grass is short, and during their breeding cycle (July to November) they are particularly dependent on recently burnt ground, often flying in to burnt areas within hours of a fire and systematically working it; the birds moving forward in a line, individuals spaced a metre or two apart, searching for and picking up casualties from the fire, or pausing in places to probe the ground for buried insects.</p><p>Gregarious at all stages of their life, they nest colonially, and at night roost in flocks which range out during the day into the surrounding country to forage. Roosting and breeding sites are mostly on ledges on rock faces, often located in a ravine at the head of a valley. Some such sites are attractively set alongside waterfalls, others are on open escarpment cliffs or, occasionally, on the vertical walls of disused opencast mines. Many sites have been in use for decades, and a few have a recorded occupation extending over more than a century. Outside of the breeding season the birds are less tied to cliffs, and some then roost in dead trees, usually over water. Breeding starts unusually early, with pairs establishing sites and building nests from mid-July onwards and egg-laying extends through August to October. Occasional pairs nest solitarily, but most breed in groups of about 5-25 pairs, their nests spaced at intervals of a metre or two along the least accessible ledges available.</p><p>Early nesting coincides with the peak period for veld fires in the grasslands as these provide the birds with high food yields and also an opportunity for the fledged young to quickly acquire foraging skills. Foraging birds are dependent year-round, though, on areas of short grass, and they may seek food in grazed pastures or even in harvested maizelands. Overgrazed areas alongside settlements are also an attraction and, if they are not molested, they may become confiding and allow a close approach. &#9;</p>",

It had landed on a thorny Acacia sapling and hung there still, one side caught up on the thorns, the rest forming a pocket of hessian a few inches above the ground. In October a Black Flycatcher built a nest in the pocket and laid her three cream-coloured eggs, strikingly blotched and spotted with chocolate brown. Because one could look down into the cup, it appeared the epitome of hidden treasure that characterises so many bird nests with beautifully patterned eggs.</p><p>Our Southern Black Flycatchers usually opt for a partially hollow stump or tree rot hole in which to build their nest, but because such sites are in short supply, they opportunistically use a wide range of ‘hollows’, ranging from discarded nests of other species to a variety of human artefacts. Of the natural sites, tree holes blackened by bush fires are regularly used, perhaps instinctively, since both the adult bird and the dark-coloured nestlings blend well with the blackened wood surrounds of the nest cavity. They also often build their nest behind peeling bark of eucalypt trees.

A pair nested for a number of years in a rock hollow inside of a large granite boulder in Gosho Park, Marondera, Zimbabwe.</p><p>Southern Black Flycatchers are usually undemonstrative, and observers remarked on their comparative silence as long ago as the 19th century. In this respect they seem similar to the Fiscal Flycatcher, but they can become quite vocal when breeding, and their song is held to be melodic and rather thrush-like.</p><p>They are commonly found in pairs or (after successful breeding) in small family groups. Being perch-and-pounce hunters, they prey mainly on small invertebrates that they see moving on the ground, although they do also hawk flying insects. Being overall black in plumage, they can be confused with the male Black Cuckooshrike or with the Fork-tailed Drongo, and they frequently associate with the latter species. It has been suggested that they may gain some advantage from their resemblance in appearance and flight to the bold and aggressive Fork-tailed Drongos, much as Fiscal Flycatchers resemble (and sometimes aggressively behave like) the Common Fiscal.</p><p>Southern Black Flycatchers need their geographic qualifier because they have a close kin look-alike north of the Equator in Africa. One of the interesting differences in these two nearly identical species is that the northern birds have matt black plumage, whereas on our southern birds the feathers are glossed. This is probably a chance genetic factor that has no obviously advantageous element. One might think that shiny black feathers would be better than matt ones in reflecting hot sunlight, but both species are subject to similar summer heat. Our southern birds (and no doubt the northern ones) counter the disadvantage of their heat-absorbing black feathers by practising what is termed ‘behavioural thermoregulation’ or, more simply, seeking shade.</p><p>They often perch on the shaded lower branches of their tree lookouts, and one in our garden used the white-painted Stevenson Screen whenever the temperature was in the region of 40 degrees Celsius, crouching in the gap between the roof and the thermometer-housing compartment while surveying the lawn. It is noteworthy that there are no published observations of this species bathing, despite their occurrence in larger gardens. It thus seems that their behavioural avoidance of overheating is effective.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Southern Black Tits occur in almost any woodland with broad-leaved trees; at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, for example, they were most abundant in bushwillow (Combretum), Silver Cluster-leaf Terminalia sericea and Burkea Burkea africana woodland, and much less common in woodland dominated by fine-leaved trees such as Acacia. They also occur in the edges of evergreen forest and in miombo (Brachystegia) woodlands, where they are common and a central species in mixed bird parties. Their tolerance to habitat transformation is uncertain, but they do occur in parks, gardens and plantations of alien trees, so they obviously can cope with some changes to their habitat, or they are somewhat opportunistic, making use of whatever habitat provides their specific habitat requirements. One of their criteria for suitable habitat is the availability of cavities and hollows in trees for roosting and nest sites. Southern Black Tits roost in holes in trees and in horizontal and vertical pipes. Their behaviour pre-roosting is similar to other southern African tit species – the birds call long and loudly very near the roost site, then suddenly go quiet before dashing to the site, diving into the roost hole without checking whether it is occupied.</p><p>Southern Black Tits are found from southern Angola east to Zambia and Malawi south to South Africa. Their southern African distribution is northern and eastern, from north-eastern Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and then south in a broad zone along the eastern parts of South Africa to about the Gamtoos River.</p><p>Southern Black Tits are found from southern Angola east to Zambia and Malawi south to South Africa. Their southern African distribution is northern and eastern, from north-eastern Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and then south in a broad zone along the eastern parts of South Africa to about the Gamtoos River.</p><p>Southern Black Tits usually occur in pairs or small groups, typically comprising an adult male, adult female and one or more juveniles, all moving restlessly through the upper canopy of the woodland, calling intermittently. They are territorial, defending their territory mainly in the breeding season. The territory size is related to the group size; a pair defends a territory of about 25 to 30 hectares, a group of three or more defends a larger area, from 36 to 48 hectares. Territorial boundary disputes between neighbouring groups are frequent and highly vocal. Foraging birds peer into any suitable hole in the trees, and forage on branches and foliage in the mid and upper canopy, inspecting crevices in the bark for pupae. Pods of bushwillows and acacias are examined for chalcid wasp larvae or other inhabitants, and, if promising, the pods are picked from the tree, held down with one foot, and pecked open to extract the larva. Termite alates are hawked in the air, but taken back to a perch to be eaten. Earthworms are eaten by the birds on the ground. Other food items include figs, mistletoe fruits which are held down against a branch and picked clean, leaving the seed on the branch. Nectar of aloes is also taken.</p><p>The breeding biology of the Southern Black Tit has been well studied. They breed co-operatively, with up to four birds helping the alpha male and female. Nests are in holes in trees, occasionally (sometimes regularly) in nest boxes. The alpha female lines the cavity with grass, lichens and hair, and undertakes all incubation. She is called from the nest by the alpha male and then fed by him and helpers. Nestlings are fed on spiders, caterpillars, and cerambycid larvae by the alpha male and helpers and after leaving the nest continue to be fed by the group for about two weeks, progressively foraging independently of the group until about seven weeks out of the nest, when they are able to get all their food alone.</p>",

They are not always easy to see because of their favoured foraging sites, but they draw attention to themselves with their loud fluting duets which enable mated birds to keep in contact when out of sight of each other. For example, when one bird calls ‘boo-boo-boo’ its mate responds ‘wheeyoo’. There are many variations of these duets, and each pair tends to have their own distinctive combinations. Sometimes one bird starts ‘hoo-whee’, repeating it at intervals before the other responds with ‘boo-boo-boo’, or vice versa. The ‘boo’ notes are similar in pitch and loudness to the call of the African Hoopoe, but the interpolation of ‘wheeyoo’ calls lets one know that it is the bush-shrike that is calling.</p>",

Birds from the Zambezi Region and Okavango region are larger than the two populations on the eastern coastal plain. Males first acquire full breeding plumage when two years old. In summer the birds do not seem to move far from the wetlands where they breed, and consequently are vulnerable to the destruction of these wetlands; there is some evidence for recent population declines in Botswana and southern Mozambique. During the non-breeding season they forage extensively in trees outside the wetlands, and appear to take many insects at this time of year, whereas seeds, berries and nectar are included in their summer diet. They typically form small flocks, fewer than 20 birds, and seldom associate with other weavers. A ringing study in Malawi estimated the annual survival of Southern Brown-throated Weavers at 70%, with the oldest birds at least 13 years old.</p><p>Southern Brown-throated Weavers breed colonially in wetlands, with up to several hundred birds in a colony. They usually occupy reed beds, often in association with Southern Red Bishops and Thick-billed Weavers. However, along the upper Zambezi they also build in isolated small colonies in trees overhanging the water of the river. Within their colonies, males defend small territories and are polygynous, mating with up to three females. Each male builds up to 12 nests in a season. The nests are oval structures woven from strips of grass, reed or papyrus with an entrance from the underside and no entrance tunnel. They are attached to several stems of reeds or other vegetation growing in the water, but occasionally nest in trees. Before laying, the female lines the nest with grass or reed seedheads. The female does all the incubation and feeding of the nestlings. In Malawi, at least some females lay a second clutch in a new nest later in the breeding season. This species seems to be sensitive to disturbance, abandoning their nests after they were checked during a study. Adults have been seen attacking Dideric Cuckoos at colonies, so it is likely that they are occasional hosts to this brood parasite.</p><p>Southern Brown-throated Weavers breed colonially in wetlands, with up to several hundred birds in a colony.

There are few birds more beautiful than this bee-eater, which, together with its northern cousin M. nubicus, is arguably the most striking in a family renowned for resplendent colours. Its appearance is matched by a vivacious, almost jaunty disposition, so that a sighting of this bird takes one’s breath away.</p><p>Now imagine several thousand Carmine Bee-eaters darting hither and thither, bright colours flashing and melodious bell-like calls filling the air. This is the spectacle at one of their breeding colonies in their core breeding area in southern Africa, along the major tropical rivers – the Zambezi, Okavango, Kwando and Linyanti. Most colonies are in high sandbanks, but in Botswana, where river banks are in short supply, they resort to burrowing in flat sandy soil, and using nearby trees as perches – turning them red.</p><p>Now imagine several thousand Carmine Bee-eaters darting hither and thither, bright colours flashing and melodious bell-like calls filling the air.

Most colonies are in high sandbanks, but in Botswana, where river banks are in short supply, they resort to burrowing in flat sandy soil, and using nearby trees as perches – turning them red.</p><p>Carmine Bee-eaters return to their traditional breeding sites, from their non-breeding range farther north in south-central Africa, every year around August. There is overt competition for prime sites at the onset of breeding, and courtship adds to the organised chaos as birds renew pair bonds by courtship feeding. The species is apparently monogamous, and both sexes excavate the nest tunnel; their scimitar-like beaks become noticeably worn during this time. Most tunnels are one to two metres long, but one of 3.7 metres has been recorded. Where they breed on flat ground, the tunnels slope down at a shallow angle. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid, so the chicks hatch a day or two apart, with the result that the last-hatched is considerably smaller than its siblings and is the first to succumb if there is a food shortage. Incubation duty is shared between the sexes in relatively short shifts. The tunnels are well buffered against outside temperature changes, and this no doubt makes incubation less onerous. However, they are not impervious to marauding monitors and mambas, and colonies on flat ground may be raided by jackals and Southern Ground Hornbills; nevertheless, the impacts of natural predation seem to be negligible.</p><p>By December the adults and fledglings disperse en masse away from their breeding sites, moving up to 1&#160;000 kilometres southwards, spreading over Kalahari savanna and broad-leaved woodland. They can be seen hawking insects in typical bee-eater fashion; like some other bee-eaters, they follow large herbivores or even vehicles, using them as beaters to flush their preferred prey of grasshoppers, butterflies, cicadas and dragonflies. They occasionally perch on large mammals, using them as mobile hunting perches that save the bee-eaters energy while inadvertently flushing suitable insect prey. Unlike the Northern Carmine Bee-eater, they seldom perch on Kori Bustards; this association has only been observed in the Savuti and Selinda areas in southern Africa. It is a commensal relationship that benefits the bee-eaters, and it is odd that it should be so area-specific when both species are widespread.</p><p>Although currently numerous, the Southern Carmine Bee-eater has its Achilles heel – there are relatively few breeding sites, and this makes the species vulnerable. All colonies should be recognised as sites of special conservation importance, and are deserving of rigorous protection; some have already been deserted due to exploitation of the chicks for food, while others have been disturbed by tourists and researchers. The colonies can be long-lived (sites in Botswana and Zimbabwe persisting for decades), making protection a viable option to secure the status of this species.</p>",

Its distribution covers a greater range of habitats than that of any other of our southern sunbirds, extending from the semi-aridity of the north-west Northern Cape south to the winter rainfall fynbos, eastwards into both arid and mesic Karoo shrublands, coastal and inland forests, valley bushveld, coastal dune forests, Afromontane forest and forest edge.

In the Western Cape there appears to be a partial movement away from the drier regions from July to December and a partial complementary movement into the south-western Cape from May to November. Movements within the latter area are fairly local. In an Eastern Cape ringing study in the Bathurst division, a small proportion of the population appeared to remain in the general area, but there was a massive influx during the period late July to early October following the presence of very few during the May to early July period. Whether these birds arrived to breed in the extensive valley bushveld of the area or were transients, is not known, although the few subsequent season recaptures of August/September ringed birds showed that these were only present during this period and, therefore, could be considered a completely migratory component. Males also go into a total post-breeding eclipse plumage in which they are almost identical to the females or young. At this time the species is easily overlooked.</p><p>The birds breed whenever there are suitable supplies of both nectar and insects available. The male is highly territorial and spends a lot of time displaying and singing from the tops of bushes in his territory. Despite foraging to the top of the highest tree, the Southern Double-collared Sunbird seldom builds its nest more than 3.5 m above the ground. They tend to select small- to medium-sized bushes on which to hang the nest about two metres above the ground. Like other sunbirds, the female does all the nest construction and incubation. The males help with feeding the chicks. The chicks remain with the adults for up to a month after fledging.</p>",

Its abundance off southern Africa varies greatly between years, being recorded regularly in some years and not at all in others. In 1978 many birds were ‘wrecked’ along our coastline. Similar events occurred in Australia and New Zealand that year, suggesting that factors outside the region were responsible for driving the birds north of their normal range.</p><p>Off southern Africa most fulmars occur among Pintado Petrels, and are easily identified by their much paler upperparts and pink bills with blue-grey nostrils and a dark grey tip. They forage by surface-seizing or shallow dives, and often visit fishing vessels. The breeding population is in excess of a million pairs, and the species is not threatened. However, many colonies depend on Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba, a shrimp-like crustacean that is under pressure from the burgeoning krill fishery, as well as from reduced sea-ice cover resulting from climate change. Juvenile krill spend the winter feeding on algae growing on the bottom of sea ice, so the loss of sea ice reduces krill recruitment, ultimately leading to a shortage of the Fulmar’s primary prey.</p><p>Off southern Africa most fulmars occur among Pintado Petrels, and are easily identified by their much paler upperparts and pink bills with blue-grey nostrils and a dark grey tip.

However, many colonies depend on Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba, a shrimp-like crustacean that is under pressure from the burgeoning krill fishery, as well as from reduced sea-ice cover resulting from climate change. Juvenile krill spend the winter feeding on algae growing on the bottom of sea ice, so the loss of sea ice reduces krill recruitment, ultimately leading to a shortage of the Fulmar’s primary prey.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Giant petrels, the largest of the petrels, are heavily built and often appear lumbering in the air. Males are roughly the same size as a small albatross, but weigh up to twice as much. In the 1960s, John Warham showed that there are two distinct forms differing in plumage pattern, bill colour and in the timing of breeding. At sites where they occur together, Southerns lay about six weeks later than Northerns. The two species also differ in their choice of nest site; Southerns breed on open plains in small colonies, whereas Northerns nest up against rocks, singly or in loose groups. Southerns have a greater breeding range, extending from the Antarctic continent to Gough Island (and formerly to Tristan da Cunha), whereas Northerns have a more modest latitudinal range, from South Georgia and Kerguelen north to New Zealand’s Chatham Islands.</p><p>Giant petrels are unique among petrels in having age-related variation in plumage. Adults become paler with age, and the two species can be separated by a combination of bill-tip colour and plumage pattern: Southerns have whitish heads that contrast with their darker bodies, whereas Northerns are more uniformly grizzled grey. Juveniles are very similar, and their identification rests on subtle differences in bill-tip colour. Only the Southern Giant Petrel has a white morph, variably spotted dark grey. These white morphs comprise up to 15% of birds in some colonies, but are rare or absent in other colonies. They are seldom recorded off southern Africa, usually only in winter.</p><p>Giant petrels are unique among petrels in having age-related variation in plumage.

These white morphs comprise up to 15% of birds in some colonies, but are rare or absent in other colonies. They are seldom recorded off southern Africa, usually only in winter.</p><p>Giant petrels are notorious scavengers, feeding on the carcasses of whales, seals and penguins. However, they are also effective predators, capable of killing penguins. Their massive bills are able to tear open most prey. Given their pugnacious behaviour, they were well known to early seafarers and whalers, who called them ‘Stinkers’, ‘Nellies’ and ‘Boneshakers’. The larger males spend much of their time on land, where they compete to monopolise carcasses. Antagonists threaten each other by approaching with wings spread and drooped, tails cocked and fanned, necks arched, and chin and neck feathers raised, while shaking their heads from side to side and giving a mix of whinnying and neighing calls. The smaller females tend to forage at sea, taking a wide diversity of marine prey; they stand little chance in the competitive melee ashore.</p><p>In southern Africa, Southern Giant Petrels are fairly common in coastal waters year-round. They are most common at fishing vessels around the shelf break. Some come close inshore, especially around seal and seabird colonies, but they rarely come ashore unless there is a ready source of food. Historically, hundreds gathered at whaling stations in Durban and Langebaan, as well as at seal harvesting operations. They are more agile on land than most petrels, and given the opportunity, they gorge themselves on carrion until they can no longer take off. They use scent to locate their prey. Despite their large size, they replace all their primaries annually (albatrosses typically only replace about half of their primaries each year). They manage to do this by starting to moult while breeding, and by replacing more than one feather at once. As a result, they often have large gaps in their primaries.</p><p>The population on Tristan da Cunha was extirpated by exploitation and disturbance in the 19th century, and numbers decreased at many colonies during the 20th century, including at South Africa’s Marion Island. They are susceptible to human disturbance, have suffered as a result of falling numbers of Southern Elephant Seals Mirounga leonina in some areas, and are sometimes killed accidentally on fishing gear. Until recently, the species was listed as Vulnerable, but the overall population is now thought to be relatively stable and it is no longer regarded as threatened.</p>",

The back and upper tail coverts are russet-brown  with a white shoulder bar. It is one of the LBJs (‘Little Brown Jobs’) which could easily be overlooked were it not for its cheerful chirping call ‘chirrip-cheeu-chirirtit, chirrip-cheeu-chirirtit...’ which is used as a contact call between the birds, and is strung together many times, with slight variations, as a song. They also add some mimicked calls in the song. They can be common to very common in some places and quite rare in an apparently similar area nearby.</p><p>The Southern Grey-headed Sparrow is found over most of southern Africa, apart from the very dry western areas of South Africa and Namibia. There are two subspecies which split the area along a north-east/south-west line. They can be found in almost any woodland although they will also move into urban and cultivated areas, provided there are trees and some cover for them. When I moved to George in 2004 we seldom saw any in our garden but their numbers have steadily increased at the bird feeder; today there are birds present as long as there is seed in the feeder. They bring fledged young to the garden from September to April, which is a remarkably long breeding season.</p><p>The Southern Grey-headed Sparrow is found over most of southern Africa, apart from the very dry western areas of South Africa and Namibia.

They bring fledged young to the garden from September to April, which is a remarkably long breeding season.</p><p>Unless breeding when they are in pairs, they are normally found in small flocks feeding on the ground in open areas and whirring up into the nearest tree when disturbed. They are resident in many areas but become nomadic during dry years. At Peterhouse, Marondera, they nested in the school buildings until they were displaced by the House Sparrow Passer domesticus spreading east along the main road and railway. However, once we dissuaded the laundry matron from feeding the latter, they were displaced by the Grey-headed Sparrows, which then occupied all the available nesting holes!</p><p>They feed on both seeds and insects, which are usually sought on the ground. The seeds include those from grass as well as small seeds from bushes and trees. They also eat small fruits from bushes such as Honey-thorn Lycium spp.,and evenfeed on nectar from Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala and some species of aloes. Their bill is not really long enough to reach nectar in these tubular flowers, but they have learned to squeeze the tubular flowers to push the nectar out! They are one of the first birds to notice a termite alate hatch developing, and would initially pick up the alates as they came out of the hole in the ground and subsequently would also catch flying alates.</p><p>Breeding starts when food supplies increase in spring and there is enough food for the females to come into breeding condition. They will continue to breed throughout summer provided there is sufficient food available. They build a nest of thin rootlets lined with vegetable down in a natural hole in a tree or in an abandoned woodpecker or barbet’s nest. They sometimes make use of holes in walls or under eaves where these are available. We had great success with this species using our nest boxes, which we hung up in suitable trees in Gosho Park Environmental Project at Peterhouse. The eggs have a white or light blue background heavily blotched all over with grey or brown spots. The chicks hatch naked and with eyes closed initially, but which soon open and within a few days the chicks start developing fluff and then feathers. They leave the nest after 16 to 19 days and remain with the parents for some weeks after fledging.</p>",

This high threat rating is due to the fact that its numbers and range have declined significantly. It is now confined mainly to the broad-leaved woodlands in the northern and eastern parts of our region.</p><p>This beleaguered species has become a symbol for the savanna biome. It is often referred to as ‘the pick-hammer of the savanna’, in recognition of its habitat preference, and its exceptionally strong bill which it uses like a pick to unearth some of its food. It is carnivorous, with a catholic diet, and will dispatch birds and their eggs, snakes, squirrels, mongooses and even young hares and tortoises, with its formidable beak. Less frequently, it will use its beak to smash house or car windows, a habit which does not endear it to the owners! This is thought to be a response to seeing its reflection, for Ground Hornbills are very territorial and will defend their breeding and feeding areas together as a group. The booming duet, which is a special predawn African bushveld sound, is a territorial advertisement to neighbouring groups. The dialogue between the male and female is so repetitive and persistent that, according to African culture, they are a long-married couple arguing. The English translation lacks the rhythm and cadence of the vernacular but, roughly translated runs like this: Female (slightly higher pitched) “I am going, I am going, I am going to my relatives”, to which the male replies “You can go, you can go, you can go to your relatives”!</p><p>This beleaguered species has become a symbol for the savanna biome.

Each group comprises a dominant breeding pair, accompanied by helpers that are mainly adult males and immatures from previous broods. At the time of the first summer rains, the female lays a clutch of two eggs (1–3) in a large, natural tree cavity, and, during incubation, is fed by her mate and the helpers. After a month and a half, the eggs hatch – asynchronously – because incubation commenced with the first-laid egg. As a rule, only one chick is ever raised per breeding attempt. It has long been speculated that sibling competition or parental neglect, rather than direct aggression, is responsible for the demise of the younger hatchling. This has recently been confirmed by biologists using a webcam to record intimate behaviour within the confines of a hornbill’s nest! The female has even been documented eating her dead chick although this is not always the case, and dried remains are often found in nests.</p><p>There are several records in the literature of Ground Hornbill groups raising two chicks per breeding attempt, but given the behaviour described above, this seems very unlikely. However, recently there has been a documented case of double-brooding in the Ground Hornbill, where a second clutch was laid in one breeding season after fledging the first chick successfully. This may account for two young-of-the-year being seen in Ground Hornbill groups in the past.</p><p>A sound understanding of the behavioural ecology of the Ground Hornbill forms the basis for effective strategies to conserve it. The information on the breeding biology of the species has led to an innovative re-introduction project at Mabula Game Reserve in South Africa, where the redundant, second-hatched chicks are artificially reared to provide the stock for re-establishing new founder populations. Provision of artificial nest boxes could also boost breeding in areas where large trees have been destroyed. Applied research like this is essential if we are ever going to get the Ground Hornbill off the Red List – something we should all be striving for.&#9;</p>",

However, they are now classified as a warbler. Either way, they typically forage up in the leafy canopy of the trees where they occur, and will often fly out to catch flying insects, perhaps those disturbed by the activities of the bird party in the canopy.</p><p>In spring the birds form pairs and become highly territorial, chasing away all other members of their own species. Each territory in the study area of Gosho Park, near Marondera, Zimbabwe, was not particularly large. It always  contained at least one or two large Musasa trees, Brachystegia spiciformis, in one of which the nest was built. The nest was usually placed in an open fork, but we did find some nests built on larger semi-horizontal branches. The nest was not normally in the main canopy but three or four metres below it. It was a cup-shaped nest about 75&#160;mm in diameter with the cup diameter about 50&#160;mm. It was constructed of fine material that looked rather like grass roots or perhaps very fine leaf petioles. The outside of the nest was decorated with the grey lichen growing on the branches of the tree, together with a certain amount of Old Man’s Beard Usnea sp. which also grows on these trees. It is so well camouflaged that from the ground the nest is very difficult to spot. The only thing that gives it away is the slight bulge in the bottom of the fork or on a branch.</p><p>As far as we could see, the female did all the incubation and the brooding of the small chicks, although we were not able to watch any nest for the whole day. The male would come with food and feed her regularly during our observation periods. Once the chicks had hatched the female would take food from the male and then feed the chicks. Once the chicks started getting feathers the female left the nest and helped to find food for them. One unusual observation I made was that on one occasion the male started to settle on the chicks and the female arrived, landed on his back, and chased him off the nest!&#9;</p>",

It has also become common in many suburban areas. In Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, it was only found north of the town in karroid vegetation in the 1980s. A single male, nesting annually at the same site along the railway line, was a pioneer settler in the town from 1988; now Southern Masked Weavers are regular visitors to the garden bird feeder, alongside Cape and Village Weavers. Individual males seem to be faithful to their nesting sites, and one bird was recaptured after 13 years in the same garden in which it had originally been ringed as a breeding bird. However, in Botswana there is a marked exodus of birds from the breeding areas, and there is one record of a South African bird moving more than 450 km. During the non-breeding period Southern Masked Weavers form large roosts, which may hold several thousand birds, and often associate with other seed-eating birds both when foraging and roosting.</p><p>This is not a truly colonial species, with generally fewer than 10 males breeding in the same area. Large gardens typically form the territory of a single male, who may construct up to 52 nests in a single breeding season and attract as many as 12 females, although no more than three are likely to be resident at any one time. While in their breeding territories, males either sleep in a new nest, or perch nearby at night. Males display at the nest, even before the structure is complete, fanning their wings and spreading the tail while singing.</p><p>This is not a truly colonial species, with generally fewer than 10 males breeding in the same area.

They are suspended from the tip of a branch in a tree, or supported by two or more vertical reeds or stems. Internally, the roof of the nest is reinforced by a ceiling of leaves and grass stems, while the floor of the egg chamber remains an open meshwork. If it is accepted by a female, the male adds a short entrance tunnel and the female lines the egg chamber with leaves, grass stems and feathers. Nests not selected by females are usually demolished by the male. However, at the end of the breeding season, unoccupied nests are left intact, and may be taken over by other birds or by mammals such as climbing mice.</p><p>Females undertake all incubation duties, and males seldom contribute to feeding either nestlings or fledglings. Females may lay two or more clutches during a single breeding season.  The Southern Masked Weaver is a regular host of the Dideric Cuckoo, though fewer than 10% of the nests are parasitised. Males attack Dideric Cuckoos that approach a nesting area, and in one case a cuckoo was apparently killed by the weavers. However, they lack an effective defence against nest predators such as snakes, hornbills, raptors or monkeys. About half the occupied nests produce at least one fledgling.</p>",

They occur in the drier areas of the west of Zimbabwe and north-west of South Africa, through the whole of Botswana into the northern half of Namibia. I have always thought of the Pied Babbler as being an acacia species but in fact they do occur in other woodland savannas, including the Commiphora and even the alien mesquite woodlands in Botswana.</p><p>The birds typically occur in flocks which are strongly territorial throughout the year. Groups usually contain five or six birds but they may contain as many as fifteen individuals. These larger flocks are probably the result of an abundance of food in a local patch of woodlands, but some bizarre behaviour of groups kidnapping helpers from other flocks has been reported from studies in Namibia.</p><p>The birds typically occur in flocks which are strongly territorial throughout the year.

These larger flocks are probably the result of an abundance of food in a local patch of woodlands, but some bizarre behaviour of groups kidnapping helpers from other flocks has been reported from studies in Namibia.</p><p>Typical of the babblers, the Pied Babbler has a loud call which is often given as a group. What usually happens is that one bird starts calling then the rest of the flock joins in to create a chorus of ‘cha cha cha …, keeyi keeyi keeyi ….., kawa kawa kawa ….’. When two flocks meet along a territorial boundary the calling birds hold their tails open and droop their wings while quivering their bodies. There is usually no physical interaction and the birds quieten down and move back into their own territories.</p><p>One of the interesting features of this species is that during the middle of the day the birds often line up along a branch to preen one another. This is called allopreening – one bird inviting birds on either side of it to preen, by stretching its head up and pointing its bill skywards. The flock also roosts together on a branch at night.</p><p>Practically all feeding is done on the ground with the birds working their way systematically across an area, looking for food amongst leaves and other plant material, checking animal droppings and even digging in loose soil for insects such as beetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers and termites. Larger grasshoppers and beetles are dismembered before being swallowed. Seeds have been found in their stomach contents, but this is probably not a major food source. The group often posts a bird in a tree to act as a sentry. This duty is rotated through members of the group so that they all get a chance to feed. The Fork-tailed Drongo imitates the alarm call of a Pied Babbler in order to steal prey found by one of the babblers.</p><p>The babblers are typically co-operative breeders, with the whole group building the nest, which is a large mass of thin twigs and coarse grass with a deep cup lined with finer material. Even with the whole group assisting, the nest can take up to three weeks to construct. All the nests I have seen have been in acacia or Buffalo Thorn trees where the thorns provide some protection against possible predators. The birds breed in early to midsummer when insect prey is most readily available. They normally lay three blue eggs that have a very rough surface caused by small surface nodules. This rough surface is thought to provide a means of identifying their eggs should a Levaillant’s Cuckoo lay its smooth blue egg in the babbler’s nest. The eggs hatch after 15-16 days and the young birds spend another two to three weeks in the nest. The plumage of the fledged chicks is plain brown and their white plumage starts developing only about 3-4 weeks later.</p>",

They also have a slight crest on top of the head which has given rise to the name ‘Pointy-headed Pochard’ in Zimbabwe. The female is a lighter brown and lacks the chestnut colouring of the male. She has a white patch at the base of the bill, and a crescent starting behind the eye and extending to the foreneck. She also has the white wing bar.</p><p>This species prefers deep, clear freshwater wetlands with plenty of emergent vegetation. They make extensive use of permanent wetlands, but rapidly appear on temporary pans once these have filled, following good rains. When moulting they gather in flocks of many hundreds on large water bodies, favouring those with some emergent vegetation. If disturbed when flightless they will dive and swim rapidly underwater, often as far as 90 metres, before surfacing. If the disturbance continues, they immediately dive again and then come up with just the head showing.</p><p>Studies of this species on the Kafue Flats in Zambia have shown that they do more than 60% of their feeding underwater. For most of the rest of their feeding they upend (dabble), immersing either the bill, or the bill and head. A large variety of different seeds from water lilies, wild rice, various grass species, as well as water lily rhizomes have been identified as food. They also eat some snails, but these comprise only a minor proportion of their food.</p><p>Like most of our ducks they are monogamous nesters with the males usually deserting the females once the clutch is complete. While they are solitary nesters, where conditions are ideal, there may be so many females all nesting at the same time that the nests may be merely a few metres apart. While the birds prefer to nest in thick emergent vegetation, they also make use of islands with dense grass if these are available. The nests often have a tunnel leading to it so that they are even better concealed!</p><p>Nesting can occur at any time of the year, depending on the rains and water levels in the wetlands. Because of the need for thick cover for the nest, they do not nest immediately a pan fills up but wait for the emergent vegetation to grow well above water level. Like most ducks, they lay large clutches with 8-9 eggs being the average size of the clutch. Although the female does most of the care of the ducklings, males are sometimes present. She will sweep her head from side to side in floating vegetation with the ducklings feeding behind her on the disturbed vegetable matter.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Most birders, and many non-birders are familiar with the hornbill family – the unique, decurved bills are a giveaway. The Southern Red-billed Hornbill, although restricted to the bushveld areas of southern Africa, is well known throughout the subregion by people from all walks of life, because it is a bird with character and a unique lifestyle that has entrenched itself in our culture. In order to understand how and why people ‘connect’ with this bird, it is necessary to know something about its biology and behaviour – and these are fascinating to say the least.</p><p>This is a bird of open woodland and savanna, with a distinct preference for mopane woodland – probably due to the fact that it is a hole nester and Mopane trees have many suitable cavities. During spring, pairs can be seen and heard calling together in preparation for breeding. Hornbill expert, Alan Kemp, divides hornbills of the Tockus genus into ‘head-down cluckers’ and ‘head-up whistlers’, based on their calls and associated displays, and the Southern Red-billed is clearly one of the former with its well-known ‘tocking’ call.</p><p>This is a bird of open woodland and savanna, with a distinct preference for mopane woodland – probably due to the fact that it is a hole nester and Mopane trees have many suitable cavities.

She mates with the male and stores the sperm in a special sperm sac and then enters the nest hole and seals the entrance closed using her own faeces, until only a narrow slit remains. The male provisions the female with insects and other small animals through this opening for the duration of the incubation period and for a few weeks after the chicks have hatched. During this time she moults and replaces her wing and tail feathers, and is totally dependent on the male; death of the male is a significant cause of nesting failure - and also results in the death of the female. Finally, she leaves the nest when her new feathers have grown, making extra space for her growing brood of chicks.</p><p>This nesting behaviour is so unusual that it has led to myths and misconceptions, and is the basis for at least one proverb. A chauvinistic outlook led to the early belief that the male ‘imprisoned’ the female in the nest, but closer observation showed that this is far from the truth. In fact, once the female has sealed herself in, she does not immediately commence egg-laying and moulting of her flight feathers – rather, she waits several days in order to ensure the male’s fidelity. In African culture it is quite clear that the female hornbill has the controlling influence, and it is believed that when sealing the nest entrance, she mixes something with her faeces which irresistibly draws the male back to her. This has led to the nest plug being collected by traditional doctors and prescribed as a remedy for wandering husbands!</p><p>Be that as it may, the relationship between the male and female hornbill is celebrated in an African proverb which, loosely translated, says “The (male) hornbill fends for the nursing mother” – emphasising that it is the man’s role to feed and care for his family. In this way, the Red-billed Hornbill has become more than just another common bird to be taken for granted – it has endeared itself to society at large. Far from being just a comical, head-down clucker, its image even appears on the money of at least one southern African country, a distinctive accolade in view of all the other spectacular competing species. So look out for this little icon with its distinctive flap-glide, undulating flight, when next you are in the bushveld region. &#9;</p>",

This species has taken full advantage of the food and nesting opportunities provided by agriculture, and is considered a pest within the wheat-growing areas of the Western Cape. While feeding young, the Southern Red Bishop also takes many insects, including dragonflies caught on the wing. They even feed on the shoreline, catching sand hoppers and flies in washed-up seaweed.</p><p>Male birds first moult into breeding plumage in their second year, but at the end of their first year groups of subadult males with partly black bills and a few flecks of red and black plumage gather to sing sizzling songs and build incomplete and misshapen nest frames. Catches at roosts show shifts in the sex ratio through the season, with a slight surplus of males at all times, and a major influx of adult males at the start of breeding. Whereas territorial male Southern Red Bishops return to the same colony and often the same site within a reed bed each year for up to five successive seasons, females show little site fidelity, with a much lower return rate, even though there is no clear evidence that they have a shorter life expectancy than the males.  The oldest birds to date were recaptured after more than 12 years; a few had moved more than 100 km from their ringing site.</p><p>Male birds first moult into breeding plumage in their second year, but at the end of their first year groups of subadult males with partly black bills and a few flecks of red and black plumage gather to sing sizzling songs and build incomplete and misshapen nest frames.

The oldest birds to date were recaptured after more than 12 years; a few had moved more than 100 km from their ringing site.</p><p>Sociable in large flocks and roosts when not breeding, Southern Red Bishops are also typically colonial, with hundreds of males in adjoining territories, just big enough to accommodate a series of nests. However, in some areas many males breed in small scattered territories, using clumps of weedy growth in grassland. The threat displays of a male on his territory show a black face mask, surrounded by a ruff of erected red feathers. During regular nest checks at breeding colonies, some males did not fly off the territory, but directed their threat displays at me. At quiet times in the colony neighbours would move to their common boundaries, and exchange threats for a while. Females arriving in the area initiate waves of excited display – short fluffed flights above the territory, with the males resembling black-and-scarlet bumblebees, followed by energetic perched displays, still fully puffed up and swivelling around the reed stems or bouncing up and down. The female inspects the nest critically; success in attracting females is not correlated with any aspect of the male’s display. Old nests are not demolished, but new nests are constructed throughout the season. A successful male may acquire up to eight mates in a season, and some females lay second clutches. Length of time on the territory, and number of nests built, seem to be the best indicators of male success.</p><p>Southern Red Bishop nests are tightly woven with a side entrance under a short porch; the female merely adds a pad of lining material to the bowl of the nest. As in other polygynous species, the male makes no contribution to incubation or feeding the nestlings. However, all males in the colony will attack Dideric Cuckoos, a regular brood parasite. Cuckoos are much less successful at big colonies, where some males are always likely to be in attendance, whereas at small colonies with fewer than 10 males, at times all the territory holders may fly off together to feed, leaving the site unprotected. Old nests are often used by Orange-breasted Waxbills, and also occupied by climbing mice.</p>",

Both species were considered rare vagrants to southern Africa prior to 2000, with only one record of Southern Royal Albatross. This has changed dramatically in the last decade or so, with Southern Royal Albatrosses becoming more common than Northern Royal Albatrosses, and both are now seen over the continental shelf more often than Wandering Albatrosses. Traditionally both species dispersed across the Pacific between their breeding grounds at islands off New Zealand and their wintering areas around southern South America. The increasing abundance of Southern Royal Albatrosses observed off southern Africa and farther south in the African sector of the Southern Ocean suggests that more birds are either continuing downwind from South America to New Zealand, or are dispersing west from New Zealand to Africa. Most Southern Royal Albatrosses breed on Campbell Island, with a much smaller population on the Auckland Islands. They are listed as Vulnerable due to accidental mortality on fishing gear as well as habitat deterioration on Campbell Island linked to the spread of an invasive shrubby plant.</p>",

From the Eastern Cape northwards to the limits of its range in Mpumalanga and Limpopo it also occurs alongside the widespread Black-crowned Tchagra. Redwing shrikes (as they are also called) are difficult birds to get a good look at, but the Southern Tchagra has a noticeably longer beak than the other two species, one third longer than the Black-crowned Tchagra’s beak and two thirds longer than that of the Brown-crowned Tchagra. This feature is not adequately illustrated in field reference guides.</p><p>Why does the Southern Tchagra have a long beak? It must have a use, otherwise it would not have been maintained by natural selection. It presumably has something to do with the bird’s feeding habits, and it has been suggested that a long beak is useful for whisking leaves, something that this bird does a lot when foraging. I have also seen one probing crevices in rough bark at the base of a tree. But the Black-crowned Tchagra also whisks leaves and probes bark, and the Brown-crowned Tchagra probably does so too.</p><p>Why does the Southern Tchagra have a long beak?

I have also seen one probing crevices in rough bark at the base of a tree. But the Black-crowned Tchagra also whisks leaves and probes bark, and the Brown-crowned Tchagra probably does so too.</p><p>All three of these shrikes habitually forage under fairly dense cover, so it is difficult to gather information that might provide answers. The small amount of data on their diets highlight similarities rather than differences; large insects (grasshoppers, crickets, beetles) and their larvae, other arthropods (spiders and millipedes), and small vertebrates predominate. The two larger tchagras, Southern and Black-crowned, also eat small fruits.</p><p>In our Little Karoo village, the Southern Tchagra quite frequently comes foraging in orchards and village gardens. The big attraction in our garden in March is the fruit-loaded African Peach Tree Kiggelaria africana. Its foliage is busy with birds that come to pluck the orange, aril-coated black seeds from the opening fruit capsules. Quite a lot get dropped in the process, and doves and thrushes pick them up under the tree. So does a Southern Tchagra that comes in silently, drops to the ground and starts to whisk dead leaves, looking for seeds that have been missed by other gleaners.</p><p>Southern Tchagras may be more often heard than seen, and that is certainly the case in spring when they display. Flying with ‘fripping’ flight noise up to a height of about four metres, the bird raises its head and crest and planes down again, uttering a whistled ‘trrr-te-te-teeyoo-teeyoo-teeyoo’. The number of syllables varies (it can be as many as 30), and this distinctive song is not always uttered in flight. They also utter some other harsh sounds, variously likened to purring and tearing (transcribed as ‘tzzwehhk-tzzwehhk’). However, they tend to be silent compared to most other bush-shrikes. Finding one of them in the dense vegetation they frequent is, therefore, usually more by accident than intent: If flushed, a tchagra makes for the nearest neighbouring thicket, usually flying less than a metre above the ground. The glimpse of white-tipped blackish-brown tail feathers recall those of the Karoo Scrub-Robin, potentially creating a vestige of doubt about which species it really was.</p><p>Southern Tchagras hide their nests well, and they can be difficult to find if one does not know where to look. Various sites have been described in the literature, but with an average territory size estimated at 4 hectares, locating the nest can be a daunting task.</p>",

They are also found in open grassland with scattered trees that can be used as perches for hunting. Unlike the Magpie Shrike, they do not nest in acacias, but they utilise any other type of tree which offers a suitable natural fork within which the basin-shaped nest can be built.</p><p>Southern White-crowned Shrikes are usually encountered in groups of three to eight birds which move around their territory together, well spread out while hunting, but keeping in touch by calling periodically.

The nest is made of grass held together with spider web, with somewhat finer grass on the inside than on the outside. The nests I found in the Brachystegia around Marondera in Zimbabwe did not have any lichen stuck to the outside of the nest for camouflage, so they were conspicuous. The birds were successful in rearing chicks, however, and the groups could always be found in the same area year after year.</p><p>Once again, all the members of the group come to feed the chicks in the nest, and it was in fact this particular species which alerted me to group-feeding behaviour because I could identify the different members of the group by the brown markings on the upper breast. These markings varied in number as well as shape on the various individuals. Normally this shrike lays three eggs, but because the nest is built to the size of one adult, the chicks start to overflow the size of the nest when they are about two weeks old, and usually by the 17th or 18th day the nest is definitely too small for all of the three nestlings. As a result one of the chicks, presumably the strongest one, will move into the tree above the nest and thereafter will be fed there.</p>",

It is substantially larger than the African Scops Owl, though, (200 g compared with 65 g), and for this and other reasons is placed in a separate genus, Ptilopsis. ‘White-faced’ is an apt name, as the bird’s facial discs are strikingly white, edged on either side by black rims, and these have the combined effect of drawing one’s attention to the birds riveting orange eyes. Another feature of the bird which is only visible when it can be examined in the hand is that it has unusually large ear openings and thus, presumably, has unusually good hearing ability.</p><p>It is an entirely nocturnal species and if encountered during the day the bird draws its feathers in against its body reducing its width so as to appear stick-like; its white face disappears in the process, eyes are closed to narrow slits and ear tufts stand rigidly erect, completing the effect of it appearing like a dead, broken-off branch. Unlike the African Scops Owl, it does not perch against a trunk and it takes to flight more readily than that species if approached, giving the impression of being a large bat as it does so.</p><p>It is an entirely nocturnal species and if encountered during the day the bird draws its feathers in against its body reducing its width so as to appear stick-like; its white face disappears in the process, eyes are closed to narrow slits and ear tufts stand rigidly erect, completing the effect of it appearing like a dead, broken-off branch. Unlike the African Scops Owl, it does not perch against a trunk and it takes to flight more readily than that species if approached, giving the impression of being a large bat as it does so.</p><p>Another unusual feature in this owl’s make-up is that it preys very largely on small nocturnal rodents, especially the Multimammate Mouse (Mastomys sp.), and it does not have the more generalised diet of the other smaller owl species alongside which it is often found. In this respect it is a lot like a nocturnal equivalent of the rodent-specialist diurnal hunter, the Black-shouldered Kite, both being dependent on a food supply that fluctuates greatly from year to year - the Multimammate Mouse is renowned for undergoing periodic population explosions – and both the kite and owl increase locally in numbers when such rodent irruptions occur. Although not yet proven, these little owls probably undergo similar food-related movements to those of the Black-shouldered Kite, accounting for their being common in an area in one year and absent from it in the next.</p><p>Southern White-faced Owls are birds of the savannas and they especially favour thornveld country in the semi-arid areas. They are common, for example, in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, and many of the photographs that have been published of this bird are of a well-known pair that nested for many successive years in the park’s Nossob camp. They are not as vocal as some owl species, calling a few times soon after dark and then intermittently through the night. At a distance just a single note is audible ‘WHooo’, but when heard at close quarters the preceding stuttered notes ‘wh-h-h-WHooo’ become audible, a delightful sound that would not go unnoticed in the quiet of the night.</p><p>The breeding season peaks in early summer but egg-laying can occur at any time of the year. Typically, the clutch is laid on a disused nest platform of twigs, either one originally built by a kite, crow, Grey Go-away-bird, buffalo weaver or Wattled Starling, or the eggs are laid in a hollow or bowl in a tree branch, stump or fork. The consistent feature of the nest sites used by this owl is that it is open above and is not in an enclosed hole. Nesting habits are broadly similar to those of other owls. The usual clutch comprises 2-3 eggs which are plain white; these are incubated by the female who is fed during this time by the male, and the nesting cycle, from laying to fledging, lasts a little over two months.</p>",

I watched one picking seeds out of a rhino midden.&#160;</p><p>Their nesting activities have been well studied. Pairs are monogamous and very territorial when breeding. The male calls from a conspicuous perch to advertise his territory, raising his wings above his back to reveal his conspicuous black and white feather pattern. The female joins him in these displays if she is not already in the nest. During the courtship phase, the male brings food to the female. This presumably provides proof to the female that he is capable of feeding her in the nest!</p><p>The pair starts prospecting the nest holes in their territory, looking for one which would provide the space needed for the female plus two or three chicks.&#160;This species favours holes which have the entrance well below the top – over 80% of the nests examined have enough space above the entrance hole for the female to climb up into the ‘roof’ should danger threaten the nest when she is inside.&#160; The birds need a hole which is at least 20&#160;cm in diameter but prefer to have a hole which is over 40&#160;cm deep. The nest is lined with pieces of bark or bits of dry leaf or small twigs which are brought mainly by the male and deposited in the nest.&#160; After the birds mate, the female seals herself into the nest, leaving only a small slit about 10&#160;mm wide.</p><p>Once in the nest the female drops her flight feathers and lays the first egg five to six days later.&#160; She then lays another 2-3 eggs at two- to three-day intervals so that the chicks hatch asynchronously. This creates a natural size hierarchy among the young, which is maintained throughout their development. Should a food shortage occur, this enables the older and larger chicks to monopolise the limited food, ensuring that at least some chicks survive. However, in exceptionally bad years, females may eat their own chicks to ensure their own survival, as they cannot leave the nest until their flight feathers have regrown.</p><p>When the oldest chick is approximately 20 days old the female emerges from the nest and the chicks immediately reseal the nest entrance. From this point on she helps the male provide food for the chicks in the nest. The chicks reach roughly the same weight as the adults approximately 35 days after hatching, emerging from the nest at any time after about 40 days. The first-hatched chick always emerges first, with the remaining chicks emerging at staggered intervals thereafter. The chicks that emerge first remain in the vicinity of the nest to be fed by the adults until the last chick has left the nest, after which the whole family moves away to forage in the surrounding area.&#160;&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This small swallow has increased its range considerably over the last century because it has learnt to build mud-pellet nests on bridges instead of the original cliff faces. The building of bridges along our major roads has resulted in the birds spreading both south-eastwards and south-westwards into areas where they never originally occurred. It is interesting that there are also two breeding colonies of this species under bridges in the Headlands area on the Zimbabwean plateau. Colonies under bridges vary from less than twenty nests to over nine hundred nests, depending on the roof area and the size of the bridge.</p><p>These birds have somewhat variable plumage but they have a little patch of rufous above the bill which leads into a dark crown that is streaked. The nape, back and wings are blue-black, contrasting with a very noticeable rufous rump. The tail is a blackish-brown and is square at the end. The throat has very heavy speckling, especially just above the breast.</p><p>These birds have somewhat variable plumage but they have a little patch of rufous above the bill which leads into a dark crown that is streaked. The nape, back and wings are blue-black, contrasting with a very noticeable rufous rump. The tail is a blackish-brown and is square at the end. The throat has very heavy speckling, especially just above the breast.</p><p>These swallows are never found far from breeding colonies during the summer months, and the birds have a very distinctive method of hunting. They fly quite slowly into the wind at no great height above the ground, catching flying insects. The whole flock may feed together and, after covering several hundred metres, will fly back with the wind to start the process again.</p><p>Towards the end of summer the birds migrate north and west, and spend our winter in the Congo basin where at least four South African ringed birds have been recovered.</p><p>Numerous detailed studies have been done of this bird, some of which have shown them to be hosts to a number of different ectoparasites which are specific to this species alone. Nearly 50% of birds are also affected by a blood parasite which weakens those infected and makes them less successful breeders.</p><p>The birds build a retort-shaped nest attached to the underside of a bridge, or sometimes under the eaves of a building. Originally these birds built nests on cliffs and were reported to build in crevices where the lateral hole was utilised and sealed by a mud nest. The nest contains between 1&#160;300 and 1&#160;800 mud pellets. Watching the birds build, it is noticeable that they also drop a number of pellets while trying to attach them to the edge of the nest. The birds, therefore, probably do in excess of 2&#160;000 trips to build a nest, without taking into consideration the number of trips to collect the lining!</p><p>Once the mud portion of the nest is completed, the birds line the bowl with fine material, often wool, in areas where there are sheep, but otherwise plant down or feathers, if wool is not available. These nests are quite durable, and many last from one season to the next and are the first utilised when the new breeding season starts. Broken nests are often repaired, otherwise the birds build a new nest if there is space available under the bridge.</p><p>The birds lay from one to four eggs. The eggs take about fifteen days to hatch, and the chicks require about twenty one days growing from small, naked nestlings to fully feathered birds ready to leave the nest. They will return to the nest for a number of nights to sleep, but thereafter the adults start another clutch of eggs and a new brood of chicks. They have proven to be very successful, and the younger birds apparently desert the natal colony and move to nearby colonies or create new colonies under bridges further down the road.</p>",

The largest numbers recorded in recent years have been in the Kalkfontein Dam.</p><p>These birds, like most of our ducks, are subject to widespread movements within their region of occupancy in southern African. The longest known move, as shown by ringing, was just over 1&#160;000 km from the North-West Province to the Western Cape. The birds normally pair off and seek territory in early winter, and these breeding pairs are found scattered over most wetlands at this time of the year, and it is clear that seasonal pans, having been filled by the winter rains, are important for feeding and breeding.</p><p>The birds seem to prefer open shorelines with plenty of shallow water where they can stand in the water away from the land. Like the Egyptian Goose, this species has learnt to feed in croplands and may cause damage in certain areas if the numbers get large enough. It is interesting that although they do not use marine environments, they do make extensive use of the coastal lakes, estuaries and lagoons in the Western Cape.  Unlike many of our ducks, these birds drop their flight feathers in the mid-summer period. Being flightless at this time they spend most of the day in deep water and only come to shore at night to graze on the local grasses.</p><p>The birds are both plant and invertebrate eaters with plant material, particularly seed, being important in winter and spring, and the animal part of the food being more important in late summer and autumn. At this time they also make use of plant material from the water. Young birds and adults both feed extensively on submerged aquatic vegetation, and an adult male may aggressively drive away smaller ducks, such as Cape Shovelers, from the area in which his mate is feeding.</p><p>The birds nest in late summer, through winter and spring, although later in some areas. Normally the nest is placed in an Aardvark (Orycteropus afer)burrow. However, where Aardvark burrows are not available, the birds will also use burrows made by Porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) and Spring Hares (Pedetes capensis). The nest itself is made of vegetable material and lined with numerous downy feathers from the female’s breast. Nest sites are reused year after year, and presumably being down a burrow, the amount of down increases annually. When the eggs hatch the ducklings are walked to the nearest water. I watched newly hatched chicks trying to dive when we approached, but only the head went underwater, leaving their legs flailing the air.</p>",

To avoid the bitter Antarctic winter, it migrates north, with many birds moving across the Equator, especially into the North Pacific Ocean. It occurs in pale, dark and a range of intermediate colour morphs. The pale morphs are readily separated from the slightly larger, bulkier Subantarctic Skua, but the dark morphs are extremely tricky to identify. To make matters worse, they hybridise with Subantarctic Skuas where the two species’ ranges overlap in the Antarctic Peninsula, and ringed hybrid offspring have been seen off the Cape, where they were assumed to be the commoner Subantarctic Skua. If seen well, South Polar Skuas can be recognised by their blackish underwing coverts and slimmer build. They can even resemble a Pomarine Jaeger rather than a large skua. One way they may stand out is by their aggressive behaviour at sea. They have even been observed tackling Wandering Albatrosses, latching onto their tails, to the bemusement of the much larger albatrosses.</p>",

Gardeners, too, are often distressed to see the damage inflicted on buds and young leaves by a foraging party of mousebirds.</p><p>Although preferring more mesic habitats than the other local mousebirds, Speckled Mousebirds sometimes move into semi-arid areas following extensive rains. On the plains between the Swartberg and the Great Escarpment, Speckled Mousebirds are scarce, but after widespread rains fell over the Great Karoo in the early 1980s there was an influx into the Karoo National Park near Beaufort West, with many breeding. Aside from the mousebird, other species such as the Brown-hooded Kingfisher and Lesser Honeyguide also penetrate far into the Karoo when conditions there are favourable. Undoubtedly, the belts of Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo that line the normally dry beds of rivers, such as the Gamka and the Dwyka, act as corridors along which birds can pass through the scrubby plains where the vegetation is unsuitable for them. In the Little Karoo the Speckled Mousebird has been seen to eat the leaves of the honey-thorns Lycium spp., and acacia leaves are great favourites.</p><p>Speckled Mousebirds are usually found in parties of 7–10 birds, but occasionally aggregate in flocks of 40 or more. Groups clamber clumsily through the vegetation, and there is much calling, especially when danger is detected. The loud ‘chee chee chick chick’ call is one of the characteristic sounds of taller scrub, particularly where thorn trees predominate. Suddenly, one bird will fly to a neighbouring bush clump and the rest of the party will tag along, in ‘follow-my-leader’ fashion.</p><p>The nest is cup-shaped and often rather roughly finished, the exterior sometimes being adorned with green twigs of Asparagus species. A nest found at Red Stone Hills near Oudtshoorn was used for two successive clutches – this is unusual in bush-nesting birds. Another nest was built on top of a disused Cape Sparrow nest. The nesting season in the more mesic parts of the Western Cape is usually September to March but in the drier areas Speckled Mousebirds will breed opportunistically at other times of the year in response to rain.</p><p>The Speckled Mousebird used to be the common mousebird in the town of Somerset West near Cape Town, but in recent decades the White-backed Mousebird has become dominant, and the Speckled Mousebird has declined significantly.

The very large number of Speckled Pigeons that feed at ostrich feedlots in the Little Karoo suggests that readily available food at feedlots may also be contributing to the increase in numbers.</p><p>Speckled Pigeons, like the closely related Rock Dove, eat a wide range of foods, mainly seeds of grasses and herbs such as Wild Buckwheat Jagopyrum esculentum, Devil Thorn Tribulus terrestris, pigweeds (Amaranthus spp.) and other ‘field weeds’, and cereal crops including sunflowers, sorghum, wheat and maize. They also eat groundnuts and small fruits, including wild figs (Ficus spp.). Speckled Pigeons feeding on Devil Thorns (Dubbeltjies) sometimes have crops bulging with the seeds, and the very sharp thorns can be felt through the skin of birds in the hand. The birds’ ‘entrepreneurship’ is evidenced in Stellenbosch, where they have learnt to feed on acorns of European Oak Quercus robur that have been crushed by passing traffic.</p><p>The increase in numbers of Speckled Pigeons cannot be explained by an increase in the availability of nest sites. In Prince Albert, for example, many Speckled Pigeons nest in gutters on houses. These sites have been available for a long time but have not been used until fairly recently. Speckled Pigeons also roost on houses, particularly in chimneys with a side-top opening, and can be something of a problem with heaps of droppings (and feathers shed during moult) in the fireplaces below. The birds are noisy too – males call from potential nest sites, and the wing claps in courtship flight are loud and disruptive.</p><p>Traditionally, Speckled Pigeons nest high above ground on ledges on cliffs and in caves, or on a ledge or in a hole in an earth or rocky gulley. Sometimes nests are built in palms, rarely in any other types of tree. However, on predator-free offshore islands the birds also nest in low niches of stone walls, and on shelves or ledges in disused and ruined buildings.</p><p>The courtship display is typical of the pigeon and dove family – the male flies out from a perch, giving two or three wingclaps in short bursts, then glides for a short distance with wings flat, and wingclaps again. The nest is built by both sexes: one bird (probably the male) selects and carries nest material, while the other stays at the nest site, accepts the material and builds the nest. The nest structure is a flimsy platform of twigs and sticks, sometimes with herbs and grasses. Breeding success is relatively high – in one observation two thirds of the eggs hatched, and almost all the hatched eggs produced fledged young. In urban areas they sometimes share roosts and nesting habitats with Rock Doves. Despite this close contact, however, hybridisation between the two is rare.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The slender, pointed bill and retiring habits of the Spectacled Weaver present a striking contrast to the many heavy-billed, colonial weavers. The only time that more than two birds are likely to occur together is while the juveniles are still accompanying their parents in a family party. This species feeds on berries and other soft fruit, but is mainly insectivorous, and also probes the bark and crevices of trees for larger prey, including geckos. On the Pietermaritzburg university campus they are not averse to collecting bread and other scraps discarded by people.</p><p>Through most of the year the pair can be found together, keeping in touch with an attractive, descending ‘tee-tee-tee-tee’ call as they move through woodland and thickets. They also join mixed-species flocks of insectivorous birds in woodland, but do not associate with flocks or roosts of other weavers. Spectacled Weavers have adapted well to densely-vegetated gardens, which often provide them with suitable nest sites, especially palm trees, and nest building material.</p><p>Through most of the year the pair can be found together, keeping in touch with an attractive, descending ‘tee-tee-tee-tee’ call as they move through woodland and thickets.

Spectacled Weavers have adapted well to densely-vegetated gardens, which often provide them with suitable nest sites, especially palm trees, and nest building material.</p><p>The nest is beautifully woven from fine strips of material, frequently taken from palm fronds in gardens. It is suspended from drooping vegetation, often over a gulley or clearing; in gardens bougainvilleas are a favoured site. There is a long, narrow entrance tunnel. Nests are usually solitary, but since the same site may be used in successive seasons and the tightly woven material means that nests can last for a year, there may be old and new nests in close proximity. One nest in the Albany Museum, Grahamstown, is woven from horsehair, probably gathered from a fence somewhere on a farm. In most cases the building of the outer structure is done almost entirely by the male, with the female a mere spectator until the lining of the egg chamber starts.  However, in some pairs the female may make a more significant contribution from an early stage. Young males apparently need to practise their nest-building skills. They may do this by building very long entrance tunnels – up to two metres long! An examination of these tunnels shows how the bird’s weaving skill improves as the tunnel grows.</p><p>Pairs typically remain together for successive seasons. During the breeding period the male approaches the female at the nest site, and elsewhere after a period of separation, with a short, chattering song phrase. Both sexes incubate the eggs, so that the nest is seldom left unoccupied. It is thus not surprising that there are few records of parasitism by the Dideric Cuckoo – one would imagine that the long entrance tunnel might also discourage entry by a somewhat larger bird! Once the chicks hatch, both parents feed the young.</p><p>The adults retain the same plumage year-round, and both sexes have black bills throughout the year. The newly-fledged juveniles have pale horn-coloured bills, a dark brown iris, and lack the dark ‘spectacle’ line through the eye. From one young bird recaptured in my garden, it seems that the dark line through the eye appears first, about a month after leaving the nest, with the iris also changing colour at this time. Three months after its first capture the bill was still brown, not black, and in the hand the iris was not yet completely cream-coloured. It is not clear at what age the dark throat patch of the male bird develops. The oldest Spectacled Weaver in the SAFRING database was recaptured in Malawi more than ten years after ringing, and it is likely that adult birds have good survival prospects.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Spike-heeled Lark is among the most unusual southern Africa members of this family in both appearance and habits. The long down-curved beak is uniquely contrasted with an absurdly short, white-tipped tail. Its typically upright stance countermands the other&#173;wise dumpy profile imparted by its reduced rectrices. The common name is based on its inordinately long, straight hind claw. But it is in its social structure that it is particularly exceptional. This engaging lark lives throughout the year in small family parties, typically of three to six birds but up to ten, which are apparently sedentary and group territorial. Males are markedly larger than females, especially in bill length, and this may be linked to their dietary and perhaps social habits, possibly allowing the sexes to at least partially avoid competition while foraging. The species is largely insectivorous, and Ernest Willoughby found that in the Namib Desert males take a higher proportion of hard-bodied beetles, and females a higher proportion of soft-bodied ants and termites. This lark is not known to drink.</p><p>Peter Steyn was the first to document co-operative breeding in the species based on his observation of three birds feeding chicks in a nest near Brandvlei in the Northern Cape. The only other southern African lark showing such advanced social behaviour is Gray’s Lark; indeed these seem to be the only two lark species worldwide in which co-operative breeding has been recorded. One group member may take on the role of a sentinel watching out for predators, while the remaining flock members forage. The species is also most unusual in occasionally taking refuge in underground burrows to escape predators and extreme heat.</p><p>Peter Steyn was the first to document co-operative breeding in the species based on his observation of three birds feeding chicks in a nest near Brandvlei in the Northern Cape.

One group member may take on the role of a sentinel watching out for predators, while the remaining flock members forage. The species is also most unusual in occasionally taking refuge in underground burrows to escape predators and extreme heat.</p><p>The call of this lark comprises a confiding chuckling trill given jointly by all group members. This call does not carry far and the species also lacks any distinctive aerial display. This means that the Spike-heeled Larks, unlike other sedentary and territorial larks, seem to lack an effective method of advertising their presence over long distances. Encounters with Spike-heeled Larks tend to be close ones.</p><p>This lark is highly variable in appearance across its wide range, which extends from fairly high rainfall grasslands to desert, but always in open country. It is a serious contender as the southern African lark species spanning the greatest range of climatic conditions. It is second only to the Bar-throated Apalis in the number of subspecies present in southern Africa – 11 in all. The palest and greyest birds occur in the north, for example at Etosha and Makgadikgadi, where they are associated with calcrete and whitish sands. The birds occurring on red Kalahari sands and in mesic grassland are more rufous, and the darkest and most heavily marked individuals inhabit the Karoo. It is largely endemic but extends fairly widely into Angola.</p><p>This lark is also unusual in that both sexes seem to assist in nest-building, another feature likely linked to its group-living habits. The nest is a simple undomed cup built on the ground. Gordon Maclean found that in the Kalahari the nests are occasionally adorned with spider web encrusted with sand. Incubation is by the female only but fed by the male and conceivably other members of the group, although this remains to be confirmed.</p><p>On my first encounter with this characterful lark I was crouched over, playing the call of the species on my portable cassette player to confirm the identity of the small family party I’d just heard, when I was suddenly startled as they responded by bouncing up to within metres of me, animatedly and noisily perturbed by the sound of apparent interlopers in their territory. I was mightily impressed at this plucky retaliation; a first impression that lasts to this day.</p>",

The bird’s colours are a mixture of black and off-white, with a streaked head, and the mantle and back are spotted, while the wings and tail are barred. The underparts are buffy-grey with dark bars. It is quite unlike any other bird in our area, and its habit of moving up tree trunks and branches, with a jerky action, is distinctive.</p><p>This species is limited in our region to the well-developed brachystegia woodlands of the Zimbabwean plateau with a few records over the border into Mozambique and one in Botswana. Where well-developed woodlands with continuous canopy occur the bird can be quite common, but in more open woodland it becomes noticeably less common. Because of their size and camouflage they are, however, very easily overlooked when birding in these woodlands.</p><p>This species is limited in our region to the well-developed brachystegia woodlands of the Zimbabwean plateau with a few records over the border into Mozambique and one in Botswana. Where well-developed woodlands with continuous canopy occur the bird can be quite common, but in more open woodland it becomes noticeably less common. Because of their size and camouflage they are, however, very easily overlooked when birding in these woodlands.</p><p>The birds have a very soft, whispering call ‘sweepy-swee-sweepy’ or ‘swip-swip-swip’. This call is often made from the nest, enabling an observer to locate the nest if one is close enough to it to hear the call.</p><p>When feeding, the birds start near the bottom of a tree and work their way up to the top, foraging in the cracks in the bark of the trunk or the branches. They then drop down and, flying close to the ground, go to the base of the next tree and start working their way up that one. The bird’s plumage matches the lichen-coloured branches of the tree, providing the bird with very good camouflage.  After a while the bird will suddenly stop foraging and sit quietly along a branch for five or ten minutes while it digests the insects in the crop, and will then resume foraging. Outside the breeding season they are normally found with mixed-bird foraging parties. In the Marondera area these bird parties can contain eight to nine Spotted Creepers.</p><p>Although the nests are incredibly well camouflaged, being typically a deep cup-shaped structure with a fairly thick wall covered with lichen, they are usually easily spotted because the sitting bird’s head points upwards so that the head and beak outline is clearly visible from the ground. The nest itself may be placed on a hori&#173;zontal branch or more commonly in a wide fork in the tree, not up in the crown, but about halfway between the ground and the canopy.</p><p>Sitting in a hide watching these birds from about two metres, I was interested to see how the changeover from one bird to the other took place. The sitting bird would call its ‘sweepy, sweepy’ call and the other bird would come hopping up the tree trunk towards the nest. Just before the incoming bird reached the nest the sitting bird would either go up the branch above the nest, or fly off the nest to the base of a nearby tree. The incoming bird would then settle on the nest to incubate the eggs or brood the chicks. At no time did I observe both birds at the nest simultaneously, nor did I observe one bird feeding the other on the nest; the sitting bird would always leave to go and feed before its mate arrived at the nest. However, other nests have been observed in which one bird sits and is fed by the other bird. When the chicks are feathered both male and female have to run a shuttle service to bring sufficient small insects with which to feed the young birds. Normally the adults feed rapidly, often every minute or two for about twenty minutes, and then stop feeding for twenty to thirty minutes.</p>",

The group is well represented in Africa, with no less than nine Bubo species occurring here, and it is because of this that Africa is thought to be the ancestral home from which eagle-owls radiated and speciated across Europe, Asia and North America.</p><p>The Spotted Eagle-Owl is sub-Saharan Africa’s stereotype eagle-owl, a common species with a range that extends from Senegal to the Middle East to the southern Cape. It is as at home in deserts as in mesic savannas, and it is the most frequently encountered owl in many areas. As a result it is well known, having been the subject of numerous studies which have shown that, once birds reach adulthood, they are sedentary, pair for life and live year-round in their chosen territories. Where these territories are, and how extensive they are, is very variable, some populations living in desert areas, others in open grasslands where rocky ridges provide cover, others in wooded savanna, and yet others living in suburbia. Equally variable is the bird’s diet, and the range of prey on record as being caught by this species is unmatched. Insects and other arthropods dominate in some areas, small rodents and birds dominate in others, but the prey list includes such variety as a hare, Lanner Falcon, Black-shouldered Kite, tern, francolin, snail, crab, gerbil, fruit bat, termite, cricket, locust, frog, dead fish and even a large poisonous snake.</p><p>The Spotted Eagle-Owl is sub-Saharan Africa’s stereotype eagle-owl, a common species with a range that extends from Senegal to the Middle East to the southern Cape.

It is very much a nocturnal species and at dusk ventures out from its daytime roost, settling on a perch, from which it can survey the surroundings. It relies primarily on seeing or hearing some catchable creature coming within range; if nothing materialises, it moves to a new position. A silent swoop with extended talons does the rest. Such unusual prey items on record as the falcon and kite were probably unsuspecting birds asleep which the owl stumbled upon and could overpower, while terns, swallows and other communal roosting birds are probably approached stealthily in flight and snatched off the ground or off their perches. Spotted Eagle-Owls have been watched hunting moths and beetles attracted at night to floodlights, sometimes pursuing the insects on foot as they drop to the ground. Open roads lined with telephone or fence poles provide ideal hunting terrain, but these are used with often deadly consequences. Many are killed by passing traffic, blinded by approaching car lights when on the ground processing prey, and the extent of such potential mortality has been shown in a sobering report where 26 birds were found dead along 200 kilometres of road in Namibia. Remember to hoot to chase an owl off the road when seen in the headlights of your car.</p><p>As with other owls, Spotted Eagle-Owls often give away their presence by their calling. They make a classic owl sound – a mellow hooting, the male uttering two notes ‘HU, hoooo’ and the female responding in unison with three notes ‘hoo-HU, hoooo’ – the phrase “I don’t give two hoots” could well have come from a female of this species. The classic owl profile is complete when a calling bird is seen at dusk, its erect posture, broad head and prominent ear tufts profiled against the last embers of the daylight. If one watches carefully, each time the bird hoots its throat puffs out to reveal a momentary flash of white feathers, seemingly a visual signal given to accompany the vocal one.</p>",

The Spotted Flycatcher perfectly exemplifies this astounding annual global occurrence. Upon completing their breeding cycle in their vast Palaearctic range, the entire world population migrates to Africa – roughly estimated around 270 million birds. Recoveries of ringed individuals suggest that most of the Spotted Flycatchers that visit South Africa commenced their epic migratory journeys in Britain, Sweden and Finland; an incredible feat for these 15&#160;g travellers – and performed twice a year!</p><p>Most will undertake such marathon round trips only a few times in their short lives, although some record-breaking individuals have reached ages of eleven years. Spotted Flycatchers often return to the same site each year, and are amongst the first migrants to arrive each summer. Their arrival is gradual and protracted across the region: mainly between middle October and November in the far north, but towards the end of November further south. They remain in southern Africa for approximately four months, while moulting their flight feathers over a period of roughly 80 days, and laying down fat reserves for their return journey. Their departure is more rapid and synchronised, usually in late March or the first week of April.</p><p>Most will undertake such marathon round trips only a few times in their short lives, although some record-breaking individuals have reached ages of eleven years.

Their departure is more rapid and synchronised, usually in late March or the first week of April.</p><p>As its name implies, the Spotted Flycatcher is an agile hunter of flying insects; so much so that its name is often used as a verb when referencing its hunting style. Its acrobatic aerial manoeuvres and effective flycatching has long made me ponder the possibility of taming one as an environmentally friendly control for flies and other irksome insects in the kitchen. Not only flies feature in its diet, however, and moths, bugs, beetles, caddis-flies, lacewings, dragonflies, flying ants, winged termites and other airborne arthropods are also taken. The bird readily identifies stinging insects, and will beat bees and wasps against a branch to remove their sting before swallowing them. A smaller proportion of prey, such as caterpillars, mantids and spiders as well as occasional small fruits, are picked up from the ground or gleaned from vegetation. As is the case in many insectivorous and predatory species, the bird regurgitates undigested food in the form of a small pellet.</p><p>Prey is caught, sometimes with an audible bill snap, while flying from one perch to another, or in a circular path back to the same perch. Upon landing, the Spotted Flycatcher is identifiable by its obsessive but brief wing flicking. Open or shaded perches, one to two metres above the ground are favoured, given that they provide a wide view of the surrounding airspace and sufficient space for aerial pursuits. Otherwise the Spotted Flycatcher is not particularly selective, occurring in most habitats with some trees, whether indigenous or alien; in arid regions it is usually restricted to riverine bush, farmyards and gardens. Some 30 million birds are estimated to winter in southern Africa, where they occur at densities of one bird / 1 to 6&#160;ha in optimal habitat.</p><p>With the exception of some subtle streaking on the crown and breast, the Spotted Flycatcher is rather unadorned, and the origin of its common name is derived from the heavily patterned juvenile plumage. Young birds lose their distinctive appearance before reaching southern Africa, but may retain some buff-tipped and pale-margined feathers on their wings. In addition to their nondescript plumage and gentle temperaments, Spotted Flycatchers also have soft, indistinct and easily dismissed vocalisations. Their unrefined squeaky songs are seldom heard in southern Africa, and their calls are not particularly attention-grabbing; listen for a sharp, high wispy sound immediately followed by one or two dry clicks, ‘sseeee-chik-chik’.  &#9;</p>",

At the same time, birds breeding in KwaZulu-Natal undertake a migration to lower altitudes, also converging on the coastal forests. The longer-distance migration between the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal takes place at night, and some of the birds come to grief when they collide with high-rise buildings in Durban, which lie across their flight path. On nights with low cloud, some birds seemingly become disoriented by the glow of the city lights (the ‘lighthouse’ effect) and come to ground without injury, some spending the next day in well-bushed, suburban gardens.

It is widespread in open habitats in southern Africa and has adapted remarkably well to open spaces in an urban environment and will even breed in larger gardens which are pet-free. It occurs in a wide range of habitats with sparse or well-maintained vegetation cover from the driest country in Namibia to moist environments in Zimbabwe but tends to occur in its lowest densities in Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique and southern KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>The nominate capensis occurs across all of our area except in a belt of very arid country from the central Namibian coastal region south-east into the Northern Cape.

This very pale race, damarensis, is not very common, with a total estimated population in the range of 5&#160;000 to 10&#160;000 birds.</p><p>It is possible that numbers have and are increasing with bush clearing. The numbers in urban areas are also increasing. On the other hand it may decline in rural areas where popu&#173;lation and increasing cattle numbers make their habitat untenable. Birds can be quite long-lived, and the record for a wild bird is of one ringed in Port Elizabeth as an adult and found sick 21 years and eight months later. Captive birds have lived for 31-32 years.</p><p>This dikkop is generally sedentary although in the higher rainfall areas of Zambia and Zimbabwe birds leave during the wet season and probably spend this period in Botswana where, in wetter years, it may penetrate deep into the Kalahari Desert. In a two-season ringing study, at Mwaku Pan, in the south-eastern Okavango region of Botswana, birds were found to be nomadic, and few were recaptured during the course of the dry season in a given year and would desert the area almost completely in an extreme drought year. Following a localised thunderstorm the odd ringed birds would return to the pan within a day or two, indicating that they had not ventured too far away. They are probably quite capable of making an overnight flight of at least 100 kilometres. These birds were found, however, to be much lighter than when originally caught, showing the effects of poorer feeding during the drought. At no time did these birds exhibit flocking behaviour as has been recorded in the Eastern Cape, where it was found that these were a greyer coloured winter visitor, probably from the Karoo, with the local birds remaining solitary, in pairs or family groups. Sizeable day-time roosts have been reported elsewhere in the south but it is not known whether these are visitors or local birds.</p><p>Where birds are breeding close to humans and have become habituated to their presence, they will defend their nest or young with an open-winged and tail-spread display that shows off their attractive black-and-white underwing patterning to good effect. This is supposed to make would-be predators think twice about coming too close. They tend to nest in the shade of a bush or tree and lay only two eggs. When the chicks are still quite young they remain within the immediate custody of one parent but as they get older, and more precocious, they may split between the two parents.</p>",

In recent years, there has been a marked range expansion southwards from its historical southern limit in northern Tanzania, with breeding now occurring regularly as far south as Zambia’s Bangweulu Swamps. In parallel with this range expansion, there have been at least five observations of singletons in southern Africa, mostly along the northern border. The first of these was at Kavimbi, northern Botswana, in July 1989, with a second at Mahango Game Reserve in north-east Namibia from March to July 1999.

The males can weigh up to 10&#160;kg while the females are usually half this weight. They are one of three perching ducks found in southern Africa and will perch readily on a large branch. They are essentially black birds with a white leading edge to the wing and a white belly.</p><p>The birds may be found throughout southern Africa outside the two deserts and occur extensively throughout much of Africa, south of the Sahara, apart from the deserts and dense forest of the Equatorial zone. In southern Africa they are resident in the wetter areas such as the Okavango, but are also likely to appear almost anywhere outside the two deserts if rain fills the pans and dams of an area. Judging from the fact that they make extensive use of farm dams, they have probably benefited from man’s activities of building stock dams and, to a lesser extent, large irrigation dams. It has certainly adapted very well to man’s impoundments although its original habitat was considered to be the flood plains of the larger rivers of South Africa.</p><p>The birds may be found throughout southern Africa outside the two deserts and occur extensively throughout much of Africa, south of the Sahara, apart from the deserts and dense forest of the Equatorial zone.

It has certainly adapted very well to man’s impoundments although its original habitat was considered to be the flood plains of the larger rivers of South Africa.</p><p>This species is essentially vegetarian and is able to consume almost all parts of emergent grasses and sedges in natural wetlands. They also forage extensively in cultivated land, and I well remember the destruction wreaked on the stacked groundnuts which were drying in a harvested land in what is today the Nylsvley Nature Reserve. They have probably benefited from the growing of crops like lucerne, as well as the cereal and nut crops.</p><p>The birds are usually monogamous breeders. Because of their large size, this species is essentially a ground nester with the nest being concealed in tall vegetation near wetlands. However, they have been recorded as nesting on the top of the large nests of hamerkops and eagles. They will also apparently nest down aardvark burrows or in very large holes in trees if available. I spent a considerable amount of time watching and photographing a Spur-winged Goose’s nest near Marondera. The nest was in an extensive area of short papyrus about 1 metre high and the nest itself was about 500 metres from the pan but was in an area which flooded during heavy rains although the area was totally dry when the bird was nesting there. Only the female came to the nest and she always approached the nest from the same direction, thus creating a meandering path through the papyrus, which enabled us to find the nest. The nest itself was a hollow in the ground into which the female had placed various bits of grass and papyrus. Mixed with this were very large quantities of her down. Whenever she left the nest she would cover the eggs very carefully with the mixture of down and bits of vegetation so that they were totally invisible from above. If she had not done so the nest and eggs would have been very conspicuous and possibly subject to predation by crows or birds of prey. Normally, after covering the eggs, she would walk slowly away and disappear into the vegetation.</p><p>These birds lose all their flight feathers in winter and will at that time gather in large numbers on the larger bodies of open water. Although they may leave the water at night to graze, it appears that they do comparatively little feeding during this moult, and it has been recorded that they may lose as much as 20% of their body weight during this period.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Squacco Herons are found both in the western Palaearctic (from where the species was described) and across much of sub-Saharan Africa. The Palaearctic population is largely restricted to the warmer latitudes, extending from Spain eastwards to the Persian Gulf region; the bulk of these birds cross the Sahara after breeding to overwinter in western and central Africa. Earlier literature suggested that migrants from the Palaearctic even reached southern Africa, but this has not been confirmed. In the early 1900s the plume trade severely reduced its numbers in the Palaearctic but these have since recovered. Currently, the major threat to the species is loss of its wetland habitat.</p><p>In full breeding plumage they are strikingly attractive birds with an elongated crest and golden-brown plumes on their back, and a golden-yellow neck and chest. Some are darker, almost chestnut, and some acquire a buff wash on the upperwing coverts. The bill, which is usually dull greyish yellow outside the breeding period, becomes cobalt-blue with a black tip, the lores become lime-green, and the normally yellow legs and feet may briefly redden. Outside the breeding period, the warm buff wash is all but lost, and the head, neck and chest revert to a well-streaked brown and pale buff, and the back and mantle to a rather drab brown.</p><p>In full breeding plumage they are strikingly attractive birds with an elongated crest and golden-brown plumes on their back, and a golden-yellow neck and chest.

Outside the breeding period, the warm buff wash is all but lost, and the head, neck and chest revert to a well-streaked brown and pale buff, and the back and mantle to a rather drab brown.</p><p>This is a bird of sedge marshes and seasonally flooded grasslands and its southern African stronghold is probably the vast Okavango and Caprivi wetlands. It is widely but sparsely distributed across the mesic savannas of Botswana, Zimbabwe and northern South Africa, and extends, though perhaps only seasonally, onto the wetlands of the highveld interior.</p><p>The Squacco Heron’s scientific name ralloides alludes to its rail-like appearance and demeanour, but its feeding behaviour is pure heron. The bird either stands or crouches at a spot in flooded grass or sedge, alertly waiting for passing prey, or it stalks very slowly forward, neck extended and head often tilted to one side. At times it will remain rooted to one place but gradually leans ever further forwards, head and neck horizontal, until it seems likely that it will tip over; then a quick stab of the bill and its luckless victim is nabbed. Small fish such as young barbel make up a large part of its diet but, like other herons, it is likely to catch and eat any insect, frog or small mammal that it comes across. And, in places where it hunts alongside other larger heron species, it sometimes loses a hard-won fish to piracy by another larger heron species.</p><p>There are no ringing records to provide evidence that Squacco Herons undertake local or widespread movements but they are likely to do so because numbers at individual wetlands can fluctuate considerably. One such place where its coming and going is very obvious is on the extensive floodplain along the Nyl River in South Africa’s Limpopo Province. When this area floods, usually after good rains in January and February, Squacco Herons arrive in numbers, and in some years they may outnumber almost all other heron species present. Here they fish at culverts along many of the roads traversing the floodplain and, when disturbed, fly up onto fence posts where they can be studied at leisure. While stalking prey in the flooded grass their buff-and-brown-streaked plumage results in their being easily overlooked, but when they take to flight, revealing their white underparts, wings and tail, they are suddenly transformed into an almost all-white, remarkably conspicuous bird.</p><p>Squacco Herons nest colonially in reed beds alongside other herons and egrets in large mixed-species heronries and, as occurs in many other heron species, their plumage becomes brighter, and their bill, cere and legs change colour at the onset of the nesting cycle.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Square-tailed Drongo is a black bird with dark red eyes. It is a bird of the evergreen forests, both montane and lowland, in the eastern part of southern Africa. Because one seldom sees this bird in the sunlight, one does not see the glossy sheen of the plumage which shows up so well in the sun. The female is perhaps less glossy than the male but otherwise they are identical. The birds have a slight notch in the centre of the tail, quite unlike the deep fork in the tail of the Fork-tailed Drongo.</p><p>The first bird one will notice when walking into the forests in the Bvumba mountains in eastern Zimbabwe, is the Square-tailed Drongo. This bird is quite common there and seems to call most of the time, with a single ‘tswing, tswing, tswing’ note repeated several times. Although not as good as the Fork-tailed Drongo, it is in fact quite a good mimic of the typical calls of other birds, but it also has a variety of other calls. The birds are usually found at about the mid level of the trees, but do not hesitate to fly up into the canopy or down lower in order to catch flying insects.</p><p>The first bird one will notice when walking into the forests in the Bvumba mountains in eastern Zimbabwe, is the Square-tailed Drongo.

The birds are usually found at about the mid level of the trees, but do not hesitate to fly up into the canopy or down lower in order to catch flying insects.</p><p>The drongos typically catch insects in flight and will sit on a perch and watch for any type of insect flying past, and will then dart out and snap it up. It is also a regular member of the bird parties which are found in these forests from about January to August. Once again its loud calls and noisy nature draws attention to it and in turn draws attention to the bird party. It would appear that it is territorial throughout the year and that it joins bird parties passing through its territory. We were, therefore, always able to find pairs of Square-tailed Drongos in the same place in the forests.</p><p>Typically, drongos do not hesitate to mob birds of prey and, in particular, snakes. The only time I have seen the Square-tailed Drongo outside of the forest was when a pair was mobbing a boomslang lying warming itself on the top of a bush in a clearing. There are stories of Square-tailed Drongos mobbing birds as large as Crowned Eagles which have flown into their territory within the forest!</p><p>The Square-tailed Drongos build a hammock type nest in a hori&#173;zontal fork in a lateral branch of a tree. The nests we found were all approximately 5-7 metres above the ground. In the Bvumba many birds do not nest in the canopy, even if they forage there, because of predation by the Samango Monkeys. The nest is basin-shaped and is constructed of fine pieces of what appear to be grass roots or leaf petioles which are held together with spider web. The outside of the nest is very carefully covered with pale grey lichen which again is stuck onto the nest with spider web. One of the nests had a certain amount of Old Man’s Beard Usnea sp. woven into the nest. Two eggs form the normal clutch, but sometimes three are laid. The eggs are usually white or a pale cream with a certain amount of speckling of brown and a very dark mauve. If three eggs are laid the chicks overflow the nest as they grow bigger, with the result that the weakest is often shoved out by its two siblings.</p><p>The two pairs we photographed were both completely undeterred by the construction of a scaffold hide about three metres from the nest.</p>",

It is also frequently seen, partly due to an affinity for sitting on roads at night, where it often becomes a traffic casualty. Its prolonged churring call, given especially at dusk and at dawn, is a sure indication of its presence in an area. This call differs from that of the similar-sounding Rufous-cheeked Nightjar by its repeated switching between two pitches, commonly referred to as ‘changing gear’: the latter species churrs in an unvarying monotone.</p><p>This is a striking and brightly marked nightjar with attractive, variegated plumage. However, it is a rather variable species, and even within races there may be considerable plumage differences according to age, sex, stage of moult and individual variation. As a result, it is often confused with other species, notably Fiery-necked, Rufous-cheeked, European and even Swamp Nightjars, sharing some plumage features with all of them. If seen clearly, however, the white of the outer tail feathers (buff in females) extending the full length of the tail, together with the white- or buff-tipped secondaries, are diagnostic. In the hand, the white (male) or buff (female) wing spots are well above the emargination in the outer web of the primaries.</p><p>This is a striking and brightly marked nightjar with attractive, variegated plumage.

The sandy-grey colour of the Botswana race griseoplurus closely matches the sandy soils that predominate over much of that region. The race welwitschii occurs in Namibia and mossambicus is found throughout the remainder of the species’ range in southern Africa. The latter two races are, however, thought by some to be synonymous.</p><p>The habitat favoured by Square-tailed Nightjars is typically open savanna or scrub to semi-desert, with a sandy substratum. They are also found along low-lying rivers with sandy terraces, as well as in altered or degraded areas. In KwaZulu-Natal they also occur on coastal dune scrub and in grassland on the edges of coastal forest.</p><p>During the day these nightjars roost under the cover of grass or scrub, in the shade of a bush or grass tuft, where they rely on their excellent camouflage to escape detection. During spring and early summer they breed in sparsely vegetated, sandy areas or in the burnt grass of vleis, where they lay their clutch of two fairly dark, pink eggs. The blacks and greys of incubating females blend in with the charred stubble of the grass, and they easily escape detection by humans and predators alike.</p><p>At dusk and dawn they feed by hawking insects in flight. In lower light conditions they probably feed by sallying out from a perch in a tree or from the ground in clearings, roads and tracks. Occasionally they hawk insects around bush fires and also feed on insects attracted to lights.</p><p>Migration in this species is complex and poorly known. A population present on the Zimbabwean central plateau in summer probably migrates to lower altitudes in the Zambezi Valley and neighbouring Mozambique in winter. Occasionally, in wet years, they migrate into marginal areas where they do not usually occur, such as central Limpopo, where they have been recorded breeding.</p><p>The tendency of Square-tailed Nightjars (and other nightjar species) to sit on roads at night has not been fully explained, although many theories have been proposed. Sadly, many roadkills inevitably result, and may form the largest single source of mortality in this nightjar. Fortunately, it remains one of our most common and familiar night birds, and thrives in conservation areas where traffic at night is minimal or controlled.&#9;</p>",

The birds are usually seen in pairs, sometimes in small groups that may be family parties, and also occur in mixed-species bird parties – sometimes as many as five Stierling’s Wren-Warblers in the party – but these may be family members joining the party as it passes through their territory. They forage on or near the ground, gleaning small invertebrates from leaves and stems of bushes and small trees.</p><p>The nest of Stierling’s Wren-Warbler is very similar to that of the Barred Wren-Warbler, built in the same way, but usually placed higher above ground, up to six metres. The birds are sensitive to disturbance at the nest, especially by humans, and will readily abandon their nest if the disturbance continues. Incubation period, development and care of the nestlings, or breeding success for this species are unknown.&#9;</p><p>The nest of Stierling’s Wren-Warbler is very similar to that of the Barred Wren-Warbler, built in the same way, but usually placed higher above ground, up to six metres.

It breeds on islands in the north-west Pacific around Japan, migrating south to the seas off Indonesia and northern Australia, occasionally reaching 35ºS. Some birds enter the Indian Ocean, with vagrants wandering as far west as the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa. There are only three records from southern Africa: two off Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, and one off the Cape Peninsula, Western Cape. All three occurred in spring (August-October), before the main exodus of adults from the breeding grounds. It is thus likely that they were immatures or non-breeding birds. They occurred singly, or in flocks of Cory’s Shearwaters. Despite intensive harvesting of chicks historically, and ongoing accidental mortality in fishing gear, the total population is more than three million birds, and the species is not listed as threatened.</p>",

It likes the grass short – knee to waist high – and there must be room at ground level for it to scuttle between the perennial grass tufts. It avoids places which have not been burned during the preceding dry season because it seemingly cannot handle a mat of dry, moribund grass lying on the ground.</p><p>It is its call that advertises its presence, particularly the short, but well spaced (two seconds) hooting call.

They avoid the dry west, and are found from eastern Botswana, over most of Zimbabwe, Limpopo and North West Provinces, and south through Mpumalanga, Swaziland, the eastern Free State, Lesotho, the interior of KwaZulu-Natal and along the coast to the Western Cape Province. Elsewhere, the range is patchy, and the birds occur in mesic savanna woodlands from Mali to Sudan, south to Angola, avoiding the central African forests.</p><p>Streaky-headed Seedeaters are fairly common in most parts of their southern African distribution range, but are nonetheless unobtrusive birds. Their ‘transformation tolerance’, i.e. their ability to nest and feed in transformed habitats such as gardens, alien vegetation and plantations, is very high. For example, at Nylsvley Nature Reserve the birds were common in the gardens but less common, or less noticeable, in the surrounding woodlands. In other parts of the range, for example, the Little and southern Karoo, they are overall less common than in the northern savannas. Colonisation of the extreme south-west of the species’ range has happened mostly since the 1960s. In this area, the birds favour arid, rocky hillsides, especially where there are proteas: in these habitats they occasionally co-occur with the superficially similar Protea Seedeater.</p><p>Streaky-headed Seedeaters are fairly common in most parts of their southern African distribution range, but are nonetheless unobtrusive birds.

Termites and hoverflies are hawked in the air, the bird returning to a perch to eat them. Aloe flowers are slit open to access stamens, and buds are opened to eat the anthers. They strip off the flowers of Red-hot Pokers (Kniphofiaspecies) as they open to get at the nectar, working along the flower with their beaks until the nectar appears. Flowers of many garden plants, including peaches and apricots, are eaten. The birds also open pods of Bitter Aloe Aloe ferox, Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo and alien Cassia species to eat both green and dry seeds. Streaky-headed Seedeaters move into gardens at Prince Albert in spring and summer, and at this time bite open Cape Honeysuckle Tecoma capensis pods to extract young, green seeds. Fruits eaten include hawthorn berries, olives and figs.</p><p>My experience of Streaky-headed Seedeaters on the inland side of the southern Cape Fold Mountains is that their occurrence is decidedly patchy, and they occur in this general area seasonally. When present, they are almost always in pairs, and most frequently seen in gardens. They nest in gardens in the village of Prince Albert, nests typically three to five metres above ground in a variety of sites that include an upright or horizontal fork of a bush or tree or among the leaves of an aloe. The nest is built by the female, accompanied by the male on collecting trips. She builds a cup of grass, dead leaves, twiglets and bark, always binding the materials and nest to its supporting branches with spider web. The nest lining is of soft material, often feathers. Incubation of the eggs is by the female only, fed on the nest by the male. When the chicks hatch, the male brings food to the nest, which is then passed to the female who feeds the nestlings. After leaving the nest, the chicks remain with their parents for some time, begging noisily for food with quivering wings.</p>",

It occurs widely through the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and Australia, and is found in a bewildering range of different plumages, with no less than 30 different subspecies currently recognised. The subspecies represented in Africa, atricapilla, is a greyer bird than many of the other races, some of which have warm buff, cinnamon, or even black underparts.</p><p>With few exceptions, Striated Herons around the world have dark greenish backs and an unruly looking black crown. Our bird has white-and-rufous lines extending down the centre of its otherwise grey breast. The eye is a piercing yellow, and the legs and feet are similarly coloured, colours that briefly change to orange or red at the onset of breeding. One’s first contact with this bird is probably when it has been disturbed, and as it flies off, it gives a characteristic, scolding chowk call. Where it co-occurs with Dwarf Bitterns the two can easily be mistaken for each other in flight, both being of similar size and having entirely dark upperparts.</p><p>With few exceptions, Striated Herons around the world have dark greenish backs and an unruly looking black crown.

Where it co-occurs with Dwarf Bitterns the two can easily be mistaken for each other in flight, both being of similar size and having entirely dark upperparts.</p><p>It is primarily a species of savanna watercourses, but there is a scattering of records extending southwards into the highveld grasslands and along the eastern coastline to southern KwaZulu-Natal (where they regularly occur in mangroves) and rarely into the Eastern Cape. It is resident along both large and small rivers that have a fringe of trees or reeds along their banks. Visitors to the Kruger National Park will encounter it at most places where low-level bridges provide views upstream and downstream, and many of the outstanding photographs of this bird come from here.</p><p>The main prey of Striated Herons is small fish, but they also take a variety of aquatic insects, frogs and whatever other creatures they can catch – even small birds. They have a much-celebrated technique of fishing which has thus far not been recorded as being used by other herons. It involves placing ‘floating bait’ in the water and then ambushing any fish that comes to take it. Bait is usually a small insect or spider but it can be bread, a piece of paper or even a cigarette butt. On the edges of streams the birds drop the bait into the water then move downstream and wait, at the ready, for it to come past. If the bait fails initially, it may be retrieved and dropped again or taken to another position and the exercise repeated. It is not widely used by these herons, although there is some evidence that the technique is more effective than simply waiting for prey to approach.</p><p>Breeding occurs mainly in the mid- to late summer months, after the rains. Green-backed Herons are solitary nesters, building a flimsy, saucer-shaped platform of twigs on a leafy branch overhanging water. These are inconspicuous structures and easily overlooked. At times, the birds nest semi-colonially, especially when recent flooding has expanded the amount of habitat available, and then as many as 15 pairs may breed in adjoining trees that have become temporarily flooded. Unlike many other herons, however, they never breed in mixed-species heronries. The juveniles appear very different to the adults, being dull brown above, spotted with buff and streaked brown and buff below. I once photographed a Southern Ground-Hornbill in Kruger National Park which was carrying a dead bird. Close examination of the photograph revealed that the bird was a juvenile Green-backed Heron. The ground-hornbill had probably spotted the heron’s nest with nestlings as it was walking along the river bank and had flown up to the nest and robbed it.</p>",

It can be found in almost any well-developed woodland but does not occur in very open dry woodland or in forests. It is a common resident of the Miombo woodlands of central Africa and is also found in acacia and Mopane woodlands. They are fairly common in well-developed woodlands which have plenty of food, but pairs may be found in isolated patches of woodland some kilometres from the next pair. It is interesting that they are able to remain in the northern Kalahari woodlands even during the dry months of winter when one might expect food to be in short supply. It is unusual that they call throughout the year, which suggests they are resident and territorial year-round.</p><p>When not calling, Striped Kingfishers are usually first noticed when they drop off a low perch to pounce on food on the ground below. When sitting still, they are easily overlooked as their brown, streaked plumage blends well with the woodland. The birds are found sitting fairly low in the woodland where they can scan the open ground below for insects and small vertebrates such as geckos and lizards. They alight right next to their prey, grabbing it as they land. Hard-shelled prey may be beaten on a branch but most insects and smaller vertebrates are swallowed whole. The bird then immediately returns to a perch to resume hunting, which is often the same perch it has just left.</p><p>When not calling, Striped Kingfishers are usually first noticed when they drop off a low perch to pounce on food on the ground below.

The bird then immediately returns to a perch to resume hunting, which is often the same perch it has just left.</p><p>During the breeding season males become extremely noisy and do a lot of displaying, during which they give their loud call while bobbing, and opening and closing the wings, displaying the strikingly marked underwings. The call is a loud, high-pitched ‘cheer-cherrrrr-r-r-r’, with the trilling ‘cherrr’ descending in pitch. The dark band across the underwing is quite different to other woodland kingfisher species. It is interesting that when one bird or a pair starts to call, other nearby pairs may well join in. Sometimes three or four or more birds will gather together and call, while opening and closing their wings. At this point birds further afield may well start calling until a patch of woodland rings with their calls. Once the birds have started nesting and the female is sitting on eggs, males often give a rather mournful-sounding call, quite different to the cheerful call given during the displays earlier in the season. It almost sounds like he is saying: ‘I’m al-o-o-o-n-ne’.</p><p>The birds nest in a hole in a tree but because of their bill shape they are unable to dig their own holes so must rely on the presence of woodpecker and barbet holes or occasionally on natural holes, particularly those found in mopane trees. Like most hole-nesting species, the birds lay plain, white eggs. The chicks are fed on insects, particularly grasshoppers where these are present, but also on the odd lizard and gecko. When bringing grasshoppers, the long spiked back legs are pulled off before being presented to the chicks. I presume this is because the spikes may get stuck when the insect is swallowed! The chicks remain dependent on the adults for some weeks after leaving the nest hole.&#9;</p>",

Both have a preference for rocky slopes, with Striped Pipit replacing African Rock Pipit in more wooded habitats in the subtropical east and north. Both have unusually musical songs; and both species have bright lemon-yellow to greenish yellow edges to some of their wing feathers, plus yellowish underwing coverts.</p><p>A contributing factor to the Striped Pipit’s magnetism is its picturesque habitat.

It is also associated with miombo and other broad-leaved woodlands, especially along streams and at forest edges.

It avoids the Drakensberg and Lesotho, where African Rock Pipit predominates. Extralimitally, it occurs from Angola, across Zambia and Malawi to southern Kenya and Rwanda and southern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>A pair of Striped Pipits’ occupation of a particular rock outcrop is proclaimed by the male’s powerful but musical song, more reminiscent of a thrush or robin. The song is usually delivered from a prominent boulder or an exposed tree. A softer, more rambling version of this song is sometimes performed when the pair members are in close proximity. This species apparently lacks a regular call note, and is usually silent except when giving its territorial song.</p><p>The cup-shaped nest is constructed primarily with dry grass blades but also incorporates small twigs and leaves, the whole structure sometimes being quite sizeable. Nevertheless, the nest is usually well hidden in a grass tuft or downslope of a rock and is sometimes partly to almost completely concealed by vegetation. Like other pipits, adults sometimes perform a broken-wing display to lure predators away if their young are threatened at the nest.</p>",

For many years leading ornithologists in Europe were most sceptical about records of the age to which our passerines lived. But over the years the local ringing fraternity – those who net birds, put a numbered ring or band on a leg and then release the bird – have built up extensive records of their captures and recaptures. One of the leaders in this field was the late Mrs Dale Hanmer who worked on a few selected sites for some 35 years, during which she must have banded over 50 000 birds. She began in Malawi where her husband ran a big sugar estate and finished with some 20 plus years in the vicinity of Mutare on Zimbabwe’s eastern border. One of the Stripe-cheeked Bulbuls that she ringed early on in Zimbabwe was subsequently caught again on various occasions in the same vicinity where it was first caught and it was last recaptured 19 years and 5 months after the first capture. An Olive Sunbird she handled survived for another 18 years, although it lived quite close to where an African Goshawk nested, and a Yellow-streaked Greenbul passed 17 years. These are all records of birds that have lived in the wild. These may be unusual extremes but the Hanmer records show that our insectivorous birds live much longer than their European counterparts. General life expectancy was nevertheless much less, being just over three years as opposed to 1.4 years in Europe.</p><p>This is one of the most numerous species in the forests of the Mozambique/Zimbabwe border, occurring primarily in the higher montane forests, though some birds go down to lower altitudes in winter. It is primarily a middle canopy fruit eater, distinguished by its substantial size, confident movements and, above all, by its gruff voice. It has a slightly complicated call of 6-7 notes that regu&#173;larly follows the same basic structure. There are about three deliberate introductory notes: ‘Chop, chap, chop’, followed by another three notes all run together ‘chippychip’; a brief pause and finally a little trill ‘purrrr’. Agitation may be voiced by a series of trills, and there will be other extracts and abbreviations from the main call but they have the gruff growling tone.</p><p>This is one of the most numerous species in the forests of the Mozambique/Zimbabwe border, occurring primarily in the higher montane forests, though some birds go down to lower altitudes in winter.

Nests are often placed within a metre or two of paths through the forest.</p><p>In recent years this species has suffered a drastic reduction in its distribution. For once this is not to be attributed to climate change or destruction of habitat. Instead it was initiated by molecular analyses and DNA evidence. How this is to be applied in the field is not immediately clear but the authorities report that there are differences in plumage and voice to support the splits. The milanjensis name used to be applied to a whole population of these stripey-cheeked birds from southern Kenya to the vicinity of Mt Selinda/Chirinda on the Zimbabwe/Mozambique border. Now that name is still applied to the Zimbabwe population and to birds on Gorongosa Mountain in Mozambique and on Mt Mulanje within Malawi. The rest of Malawi and southern Tanzania now has its own form, and then from Iringa north to the Chyulu and Taita Hills of Kenya there is a third species. This is manna from heaven for twitchers who compile lists of birds seen, and the addicts have no hesitation in adding another bird or two to their lists, depending on where they have seen what are now different forms of what was a single species.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Skuas are related to gulls and terns, but tend to be more rapacious, and have a reputation for stealing food from other birds, forcing them to regurgitate after dramatic aerial chases. Like raptors, the female is the larger sex. The Subantarctic Skua is the largest skua in the region, and is unusual in being the only southern African species not to occur in different colour morphs. However, the plumage is still quite variable, with the back feathers, in particular, becoming quite bleached in some adults. They superficially recall a juvenile Kelp Gull, but are much more robust with richer brown plumage and distinctive white primary bases. At close range the thick, knobbly black legs with a wicked, talon-like hind claw are unmistakable. Juveniles are similar to adults, but have more uniform plumage and reduced white primary flashes.</p><p>Subantarctic Skuas have something of a Jekyll and Hyde personality. On their wintering grounds off southern Africa they mostly scavenge scraps at fishing vessels, or snatch prey from the water surface like gulls. However, they occasionally give glimpses&#173; of the more aggressive behaviour they display on their breeding grounds, chasing shearwaters or gannets to force them to regurgitate their prey. They sometimes even kill the odd bird by forcing them underwater and pecking at their heads. Such antics seem second nature in their Antarctic breeding sites, where they are effective predators, feeding mainly on burrow-nesting petrels or penguin eggs and chicks. They even tackle birds as large as themselves, such as White-chinned Petrels. In southern Africa, the best place to witness such audacious antics is at St Croix Island near Port Elizabeth, where small numbers of Subantarctic Skuas gather each year to harass the largest surviving African Penguin colony. They are quick to pounce on any unguarded eggs or chicks, making it essential for anyone visiting the island to be extremely careful not to disturb the penguins. But the skuas are clever and resourceful, and even without human assistance, are adept at robbing penguin nests. Working as a team, one bird will distract the parent on the nest, while another grabs a hapless chick from behind the parent’s back. Another place where you can witness them in action is around Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, just outside southern African waters, where they wait to harass Red-footed Boobies returning to the island to feed their chicks. The boobies stand little chance against the skuas which are powerful and swift in flight. Often several skuas will target a single booby, taking turns to attack, until it eventually regurgitates its hard-won food. But sometimes the prey fights back. There is one gruesome record of a skua dying after it swallowed a large cuttlefish, which ate its way out of the bird’s stomach.</p><p>Subantarctic Skuas have something of a Jekyll and Hyde personality.

Ringing records show that birds from colonies in both the Indian and Atlantic Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean reach southern Africa. The breeding population on South Africa’s Marion Island has almost halved over the last few decades, possibly due to local food shortages. The island’s vast penguin colonies have decreased in recent years, and the population of burrow-nesting petrels seems to have made little recovery following the removal of cats from the island in the early 1990s. Fortunately, the population on adjacent Prince Edward Island appears to be stable, thanks to the island having been spared the ravages of introduced mammals.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This spurfowl is distinguishable from the Red-necked Spurfowl – which also has bare red skin on the throat and around the eyes – by its black, not red legs. Hybridisation between these two closely related species occurs regularly in the wild, and a new ‘species’ of spurfowl described by Austin Roberts in the 1940s (Cooper’s Spurfowl) was later correctly identified as a hybrid between these two species.</p><p>Swainson’s Spurfowls are widespread in southern Africa, having expanded their range into agricultural areas in KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and parts of Zimbabwe. They are also found in a wide range of habitats, being common in most woodland, savanna and tall grassland areas adjacent to cultivation and water, except in the drier parts of Namibia, the Eastern Cape grasslands, the Karoo and fynbos.</p><p>Swainson’s Spurfowls are widespread in southern Africa, having expanded their range into agricultural areas in KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and parts of Zimbabwe. They are also found in a wide range of habitats, being common in most woodland, savanna and tall grassland areas adjacent to cultivation and water, except in the drier parts of Namibia, the Eastern Cape grasslands, the Karoo and fynbos.</p><p>Usually in pairs or small family groups, they are bolder and more conspicuous than the other savanna spurfowls. During the morning and late afternoon, they venture from cover into open ground to feed and dust-bathe. In the heat of the day they rest in the shade of thick bush. They are particularly fond of weedy land edges which are next to tall grass and trees, as well as the banks of rivers and the rank growth of vlei edges. When disturbed, they run into cover or, if surprised far from cover, will fly to the closest cover, from which they are difficult to re-flush, or will perch in a tree. They roost in low trees, and sometimes remain at the roost on wet mornings. The call is a harsh repeated ‘krrraa, krrraa, krrraa’, sometimes rendered as ‘kwahli, kwahli’, descending in pitch and volume. It is similar to that of the Red-necked Spurfowl, but is less even in pitch and volume. Calling is most frequent at dawn and dusk, and calling males perch prominently on a termite mound, fence post or tree stump. They also have a high-pitched, mewing contact call used by separated birds, or between young birds and their parents.</p><p>Their winter diet is seeds, bulbs, tubers, roots, and berries, but they will also take waste grains such as maize, sorghum, barley and cereals. In summer they supplement their protein needs with termites, worms, beetles, grasshoppers, ticks, spiders and small molluscs. They also congregate at livestock feedlots where food is available. They have been somewhat unfairly accused of seedling damage. Although they occasionally eat maize seedlings, the amount taken is less than alleged and they probably dig out seedlings in search of cutworm larva rather than targeting the seedlings themselves as food. Indeed, the number of weed seedlings eaten, coupled with the high intake of cutworms, compensate for any perceived damage. Unusual among spurfowls, coveys often move to water in the late afternoon for a drink before roosting. Water is however not critical, since they flourish in dry areas where water is scarce and out of reach of most of the birds. They sometimes feed at night in open lands at full moon, especially following hot summer days.</p><p>Breeding can occur throughout the year, peaking during late summer and autumn. They are monogamous and territorial. The nest is lined with grass and leaves, and usually well concealed within dense cover. Where dense cover is not available, the middle of a large grass tuft is hollowed out to form a well-concealed, shallow bowl. They also nest among crops or in old lands. The clutch of four to six, sometimes up to eight eggs, is incubated by the female for 21-24 days. Chicks can flutter-fly at 14 days and are almost adult size at three months.</p><p>This successful species is particularly tolerant of human-disturbed habitats. There is evidence that part of their range expansion into KwaZulu-Natal, and more recently into the Northern and Eastern Cape, was assisted by deliberate introductions.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Bee-eaters are all brightly-coloured aerial insectivores specialising in a diet of bees, wasps, dragonflies and other flying insects; they all have the same body shape; and all nest in underground tunnels. The success of this life strategy is evident from the way bee-eaters have diverged to occupy a variety of different ecological niches. However, it does have some constraints which need to be overcome in innovative ways, and these are apparent in the life history of the diminutive Swallow-tailed Bee-eater.</p><p>This species has managed to colonise most of the subregion, including the arid and semi-arid Kalahari where it is a common breeding resident, but in so doing, it has made several adjustments to the standard bee-eater model. It is generally solitary, occurring in pairs or small family groups, constrained by the reduced availability of its insect prey, particularly during the winter months. It makes no sense to flock together if your food is sparsely distributed in the environment – this would lead to needless competition. Many other bee-eaters are gregarious and migratory, the latter being a common strategy for insectivores; in order to be resident year-round in areas like the Kalahari, the Swallow-tailed Bee-eater cannot afford to be too sociable.</p><p>This species has managed to colonise most of the subregion, including the arid and semi-arid Kalahari where it is a common breeding resident, but in so doing, it has made several adjustments to the standard bee-eater model.

Many other bee-eaters are gregarious and migratory, the latter being a common strategy for insectivores; in order to be resident year-round in areas like the Kalahari, the Swallow-tailed Bee-eater cannot afford to be too sociable.</p><p>This aversion to crowds extends to breeding: Swallow-tailed Bee-eaters do not nest in large colonies like many of its migratory cousins which exploit temporarily abundant food supplies, rather it nests solitarily. A major challenge for a tunnel-nesting species in the flat, sandy Kalahari is the apparent paucity of places where a hole can be excavated. However, this species manages to find sufficient suitable sites for this purpose, and in some cases excavates its metre-long tunnel in the roof or sidewall of an Aardvark burrow. It is incongruous to see this colourful bird disappearing into the dark depths underground, but close inspection invariably shows that it is breeding there. Apart from being a well-concealed place for the eggs and young, the temperature and humidity underground are more constant, easing the stresses of parental care in often harsh arid environments. The downside of tunnel-nesting – for all bee-eater species – is that the nest chamber becomes fouled with faeces of the chicks and the regurgitated pellets of indigestible chitinous exoskeletons from their food. Perhaps this is not as bad as it seems from a human perspective; when the fledglings emerge from the nest they are generally in immaculate condition with every feather in place and preened clean.</p><p>Small birds have a larger surface area to volume ratio than large birds, which has important consequences for temperature regulation. In addition, the bee-eater’s elongate shape may facilitate heat loss. While this may be advantageous during the midday heat, it is a serious challenge on a cold winter’s night, especially in the Kalahari where nocturnal temperatures drop dramatically. At night, Swallow-tailed Bee-eaters huddle together in groups on sheltered branches for warmth, and on crisp Kalahari mornings may be seen – with feathers on the back and mantle raised – absorbing the life-giving sunshine.</p><p>In the fickle and variable Kalahari environment, there is little merit in being territorial or even sedentary; Swallow-tailed Bee-eaters are nomadic and move about to take advantage of changing conditions. Their local movements are not well understood, but non-breeding birds appear to move restlessly in search of greener pastures. They are the most widespread of the resident bee-eaters in southern Africa. Thus Swallow-tailed Bee-eaters are physically and behaviourally adapted to coping with the challenges and opportunities provided by their environment. Their success is testament to the success of the basic bee-eater blueprint.</p>",

One occurs in the Zambezi region of Namibia, the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana, and the extreme north-west of Zimbabwe.

The isolated and smaller nominate race C. n. natalensis is endemic to the subregion and occurs in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal and adjacent southern Mozambique.

A less often-heard call is a tremulous “kwa wu wu wu wu”, given in flight or from the ground.</p><p>During the day Swamp Nightjars roost under tussocks in rank grass, often around clumps of Lala Palms. They are highly cryptic at their roosts, but if seen, their dark, boldly spotted appearance with extensive black markings on the upperparts, together with their short, squat shape and typical habitat are diagnostic. When seen up close at night, adult Swamp Nightjars are striking birds with colourful, variegated markings and exceptionally large eyes.</p><p>They are crepuscular and nocturnal, hunting by flying low over their grassland habitat, or settling in clearings or on tracks and on fronds of vegetation from where they will hawk insects. Their eyes face forward and upward, allowing insects to be seen against the evening sky and captured from below. Beetles, moths, termites and a variety of other flying insects comprise their diet.</p><p>The conservation status of the nominate race merits particular attention. The range of this relatively small population contracted markedly in the last century due to loss and fragmentation of its habitat. Agriculture (especially sugar cane farming), afforestation, urban sprawl and coastal property developments, bush encroachment, and wetland drainage and burning have contributed to its decline. On the positive side are the rehabilitation of grasslands and removal of alien trees in conservation areas, especially in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a stronghold of the species in kwaZulu-Natal. &#9;</p>",

In eastern Zimbabwe it is replaced by the closely related Yellow-bellied Waxbill, but there are two isolated populations of Swee Waxbills in the Matobos and on Wedza Mountain. These could be relict populations from a wetter period when forest-type vegetation extended much further west than today. Found mainly in pairs when breeding or small groups when not breeding, this is a quiet bird, regularly retreating to dense cover, and easily overlooked. However, they can become tame and confiding in gardens. When foraging, they often perch on plants and grass stems to reach seeds. They may drink from water droplets on the vegetation. They also take small insects, occasionally catching insects in flight.</p><p>Some local movements seem to occur based on presence or absence of the birds in particular areas. Last recorded on the Cape Peninsula in the 1950s, Swee Waxbills recolonised the area in the 1990’s, suggesting that they are capable of more extensive movements than expected. In the southern Cape, the birds appear in isolated patches of grass in the montane fynbos only when these are in seed, moving on once the seed is finished.</p><p>Some local movements seem to occur based on presence or absence of the birds in particular areas.

They also carry out brief greeting displays after a period of separation, adopting an upright posture. When breeding, they are solitary nesters, and evidently territorial. In courtship, the male bobs and sings while holding a piece of grass or a feather in his bill. Both sexes may adopt a vertical body posture with some feathers ruffled on both the back and the belly. As the male sings, the female responds with contact calls to each song phrase. She then bows, and bill-wipes slowly. While these detailed observations are based on captive birds, there is no reason to assume that their displays differ significantly outside an aviary.</p><p>The nest is placed in vegetation two metres or more above the ground, and is an oval structure with a side entrance near the top, which may be covered by a hood or spout. Nests are usually placed in trees, in the bunches of denser leaves. The nest is built by both sexes, though the male evidently brings the material: coarse dry grass for the outer layer, with an inner lining of grass inflorescences, soft plant down and feathers. Both sexes incubate, although at night observations on aviary birds suggest that the female covers the eggs, while the male roosts alongside. Both sexes also feed the young. Aviary-raised fledglings returned to the nest at night for several days until they became independent. Newly fledged young in the wild were seen begging persistently from the female.</p><p>We lack detailed information on the survival, dispersal or breeding success of wild populations. There is one confirmed record of parasitism by the Pin-tailed Whydah, but illegal capture for the cage-bird trade is probably the main conservation problem in our region.</p>",

The race breeding in Namibia and South Africa spreads out around the coastline as far as southern Angola and southern Mozambique. These sites at the edges of the range are used mostly as nurseries by some of the young during their formative years. In Mozambique, Swift Terns from southern Africa may mix with the much paler East African race, T. b. thalassina. This bird is as pale as a Sandwich Tern, and birders in Mozambique should be aware of its possible occurrence.</p><p>Breeding has been attempted, normally unsuccessfully, by three-year-old birds, but the majority breed for the first time from four to six years of age and some probably not until they are even older. Most Swift Terns in southern Africa breed on offshore islands, mainly in the Western Cape but also in the Eastern Cape and Namibia. However, with the growing population of Swift Terns and disturbance at some island breeding sites, there has been an increasing tendency for birds to breed on the mainland. Mainland breeding has taken place in saltworks at Swakopmund, Velddrif and Algoa Bay, on the roof of a building at Saldanha, within the harbour complexes at Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, and at a sewage works in False Bay. Entire colonies may shift from one breeding island to another from year to year, usually as a result of some form of disturbance such as predation of chicks (e.g. by Great White Pelicans on Dassen Island) or failure of food supplies. Unlike many of the subregion’s other seabirds, numbers of Swift Terns breeding in southern Africa have continued to grow since the early 1990s, and the population may now number close to 20&#160;000 pairs. Once breeding finishes, the adults and their accompanying young disperse quickly and randomly along the coastline, the young probably remaining with their parents for at least three months. The Western Cape birds may move either east or north, mostly northwards nowadays where they mix with the Namibian birds. At the same time, some Namibian-bred birds disperse as far south and east as KwaZulu-Natal. Although the birds spread out all around the coast during the non-breeding season, the greatest numbers remain in the Western Cape</p><p>Ringing studies have shown that small numbers of Swift Terns may live for more than 20 years, with the oldest, to date, at 34 years. The pair bond appears to be strong and even outside the breeding season – adults reinforce this with gifts of food and by performing synchronised flight displays – they even use a comfort call when they return together after being parted for a while.</p><p>Breeding extends from late summer into winter, with the result that it overlaps with the period when visiting Subantarctic Skuas are in local waters. These birds sometimes follow adults into the breeding colonies, as has been observed at Bird Island in Nelson Mandela Bay, causing great consternation among the entire population.</p>",

But a couple of serious droughts in the early 1990s led to a population crash, probably caused by a lack of surface water as streams dried up altogether. Even today, numbers have still not recovered and the birds no longer occur below 1&#160;500 metres in the Bvumba.</p><p>These are birds that take some tracking down.

Well, it’s small. So small in fact that on the big krantzes it prefers, it is confusable with large swifts when it’s on the move!  Actually, it’s about the size of a kestrel, with a very short tail and wide-based, swept-back wings. On superficial inspection, a perched Taita resembles an adult Lanner Falcon, but it is much more squat in build, the grey on its back is much darker, its throat is much whiter, and its head cap is much fuller with a thicker ‘moustache’, and large nape patches extending onto the back of the neck. In flight, the Taita is more easily mistaken for a Peregrine, but it is even more thickset, with a much shorter tail, and shorter, blunt-ended wings. Many authors have referred to this bird’s parrot-like appearance in flight, and it does have the big, round-headed look of a parrot and an amazingly rapid wingbeat as it powers along. But with a bit of wind to hold it aloft, the whirring wings are set straight and flexed, and the Taita switches into overdrive.</p><p>For a bird that flies so fast, so easily and so often, Taita Falcon pairs are remarkably localised in their movements, and can be seen within the close confines of their nest cliffs for much of the day, doing much of their foraging close to home. They generally target small birds (in the 10-30 g weight range) which are taken in high-velocity stoops initiated either from the cliff or from the soar, and often make strikes at birds flying low over the underlying woodland canopy. Hunting bouts are strangely episodic, with multiple strikes made over periods of an hour or two, before lapsing back into relative inactivity.</p><p>The Taita Falcon is distributed down the eastern half of Africa, reputedly from southern Ethiopia to South Africa, and west into Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It occurs very patchily within this range, with fewer than 50 known nest sites, in most cases confined to pockets of fewer than ten pairs located in particular river or mountain systems, and may have disappeared from one or two of these since they were discovered in the late 1900s. It is a poorly known and little understood bird, and barring one or two quite easy spots, it takes a good deal of effort to see it properly. My advice? Make the effort – it’s worth it!</p>",

In southern Africa the species occurs from eastern Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique through north-eastern South Africa to Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal, and from there south and west through the coastal lowlands to the Western Cape. The species’ range in South Africa has expanded westwards in recent decades: the birds were not known west of Knysna in the mid-1960s, but since then have been recorded as far west as the Cape Peninsula. It has been suggested that this expansion in range is linked to the spread of one of their food plants – the alien Castor Oil Bush Ricinus communis – but it may be due to other land-use changes, such as the invasion of previously treeless water courses by alien trees. In the Little Karoo, Tambourine Doves occur in the forested strips along the rivers in Seven Weeks Pass near Ladismith and Meiringspoort Pass near De Rust. In both places Castor Oil Bushes are present, and the birds are sometimes seen at the patches of Castor Oil Bush, but they are frequently seen in native forest patches.</p><p>The species is locally common in parts of the Eastern Cape, and common in KwaZulu-Natal. It is considered rare in areas of Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces, but in my experience is locally common along the Letaba River at Tzaneen. The species is generally scarce and patchy in the Little Karoo, but does occur in the Huisrivier Pass near Calitzdorp, and along the Matjiesrivier at the foot of the Swartberg Mountains.</p><p>The species is locally common in parts of the Eastern Cape, and common in KwaZulu-Natal.

In the latter situation the birds blend into their surroundings very well, and often are not seen until the last moment when they rise with a clatter of wings and speed away in a short, zigzag flight, settling again nearby. Most of their food is made up of seeds of grasses and trees, but small fruits, taken directly from the trees, are also sometimes eaten. Fruits eaten range from the small black fruits of Solanum species to larger fruits of Waterberry Syzygium cordatum and Pigeonwood Trema orientalis. Termites and small snails are also eaten, probably opportunistically.</p><p>Tambourine Doves are monogamous and territorial. The courtship display is not known, but the nest is built by the female using material delivered by the male. She builds a frail saucer of twigs, leaf petioles and roots, lined with rootlets. Nests are placed in the tangled branches of a creeper, bush or tree, sometimes in riverine forest, very occasionally in gardens, and may be up to 10 metres above ground. Nests are sometimes well hidden – at Tzaneen a male repeatedly carried nest material into dense undergrowth adjacent to my house, but I could not find the nest! Two eggs are laid, sometimes only one – creamy white to cream in colour. Incubation is by both sexes, but mainly by the female. Nestlings are fed on ‘pigeon’s milk’ by both parents. The provisioning parent alerts the nestlings of its return with a short call.&#9;</p>",

In some references, including the authoritative handbook The Birds of Africa, the Tawny and Steppe Eagles have been listed as being two races of the same species but current opinion is that these are not conspecific. These two eagles are readily distinguishable in the field, and furthermore Tawny Eagles are breeding residents in southern Africa whereas Steppes are non-breeding summer visitors from the Palaearctic.</p><p>As one of several large, brown-plumaged raptors occurring in the region, distinguishing the Tawny from these others can be quite a challenge for the uninitiated. The dichotomy between species with and without feathered legs is a good starting point - the Aquila eagles, of which the Tawny is one, have feathered tarsi that characterise the true eagles. This feature  distinguishes them from other brown raptors with unfeathered tarsi - Brown Snake Eagle, juveniles of the Bateleur, Black-chested Snake-Eagles, and even the larger buzzards. Its leggings have a particularly shaggy appearance and this, its larger size and heavier bill, set it apart from the similar looking Lesser Spotted Eagle and Wahlberg’s Eagle. What often further confounds identifying Tawny Eagles correctly is their very variable plumage. Tan-coloured or ‘tawny’ birds are the easiest, but some individuals, apparently mostly adult females, are a darker brown with yet darker streaking; others are ginger brown, and yet others are cream-coloured - these often referred to as ‘blondes’. Blondes are thought to be first-year birds and some of them have ginger heads, perhaps revealing a plumage transition in progress.</p><p>As one of several large, brown-plumaged raptors occurring in the region, distinguishing the Tawny from these others can be quite a challenge for the uninitiated.

Blondes are thought to be first-year birds and some of them have ginger heads, perhaps revealing a plumage transition in progress.</p><p>Like most other savanna eagles, Tawny Eagles live year-round in pairs and these maintain permanent territories from which conspecifics are excluded. In prime habitat such territories extend over 5 000 – 7 000 hectares, with about 5-6 kilometres being the average spacing between adjacent nests. But as the habitat becomes marginal so the spacing between neighbours increases and adjacent nests may extend to 20-30 kilometres apart. Although Tawny Eagles are very versatile predators and efficient scavengers and pirates to boot, it is probably prey availability on the ground that ultimately dictates territory size, and areas with good populations of hares, mongooses and squirrels or high densities of gamebirds or reptiles, will support more Tawny Eagles than those where fewer occur.</p><p>The range of food items recorded being taken by Tawny Eagles is formidable, literally ranging from termites to elephant carcasses. A portion of the bird’s food comes from scavenging at carcasses (even those of elephants), which it often shares unwillingly with vultures, a proportion comes from prey that has been pirated from other birds, and aerial tussles between Bateleurs trying to hang onto their food and Tawny Eagles trying to rob them, are a frequent occurrence where the two occur together. Finally, a proportion comes from their own hunting efforts and in this respect Tawny Eagles are no slouches, well capable of catching gamebirds, waterfowl, flamingos, hares, mongooses, monitor lizards and even young antelope.</p><p>Nesting takes place in winter and Tawny Eagles characteristically place their nests on the very top of a tall tree with a 360-degree view. Usually placed atop a large knobthorn or Baobab, in recent years there has been increasing use made of the top crossbars of electricity pylons for this purpose. The nest is a large, flattish platform of sticks about a metre across with a central depression in which the clutch of two eggs is laid, and the nesting cycle, from laying to fledging, lasts about four months. Most of the incubation and chick brooding is done by the female, and  cainism almost invariably eliminates the second-hatched chick from the brood.</p>",

There are two isolated populations in Africa with one in West Africa occurring in a broad belt from the west coast eastwards to the Central African Republic. There is then a broad break in distribution, where they avoid the forested regions, until Ethiopia and south-eastern Sudan, and then occur fairly continuously southwards to southern Africa, part of the Congo and Angola. Birds in this latter-described range are said to form three populations (races), all of which are recorded in our region. However, as there is much variation in the plumages of birds and owing to their highly nomadic and locally migratory behaviour, the different populations tend to admix. This complicates the issue and it is more likely that there is only clinal variation with the palest birds breeding in the more arid areas and the darkest birds in the moister regions. They are also considered fairly sedentary in West Africa, with only local wanderings and short seasonal movements.</p><p>This is generally a widespread and locally common species overlapping in range with the superficially similar Cream-coloured Courser in the north and the Burchell’s Courser in the south-west. Throughout the eastern/southern range the population estimate probably lies in the range of 40&#160;000 to 100&#160;000 birds. There has been some range contraction in southern Africa, especially in the Eastern Cape. It is probably sensitive to agricultural intensification and intensive stock grazing pressure although where Miombo woodland has been cleared on commercial farms in Zimbabwe, the resultant lush grasslands need heavy grazing or burning to make them suitable for this species.</p><p>This is generally a widespread and locally common species overlapping in range with the superficially similar Cream-coloured Courser in the north and the Burchell’s Courser in the south-west.

Here they arrive mainly May to July and have departed by December. There is a large summer influx into Botswana, these probably being the migrants from further north and east. Here they occur in parties of usually less than a dozen, although up to 40 have been recorded on dry pans and open, bare areas of calcrete. Although spreading out to feed during the day they come together to roost in loose assemblages at night. Elsewhere they respond very rapidly to veld fires, often moving in while the fires are still burning to take advantage of the availability of insect life now left stranded on the burnt veld.</p><p>Although I have found nests in a variety of sites, especially on sandier soils where the grass has been well grazed and trampled, it is on burnt grassland that the camouflage of the eggs and young comes into best effect. This applies particularly with the small young which have irregular black marks on the upperparts that look just like fragments of burnt grass.</p>",

One bird ringed in December 1966 was recovered on the Russian breeding grounds at approximately 65°N 52°E in June 1967, while another ringed in February 1973 was caught on northward migration at Lake Kota, Ethiopia, in April 1976. The eastern breeding limits of the birds visiting Africa are not known, and we may receive some visitors from Western Siberia, but most of these birds probably winter farther east.</p><p>The population visiting southern Africa probably migrates south between the Volga and Ural Rivers, through the Caucasus/Caspian region and Ukraine. Most birds migrate down the east coast of Africa, but birds visiting the west coast presumably pass over the interior of Africa.

One bird ringed in December 1966 was recovered on the Russian breeding grounds at approximately 65°N 52°E in June 1967, while another ringed in February 1973 was caught on northward migration at Lake Kota, Ethiopia, in April 1976. The eastern breeding limits of the birds visiting Africa are not known, and we may receive some visitors from Western Siberia, but most of these birds probably winter farther east.</p><p>Arrival on the east coast of southern Africa occurs from September to November. At this time, occasional vagrants pitch up at inland wetlands in a band from Zambia and Zimbabwe through to the Namibian coast. Arrival of Namibian birds is presumably mainly via a trans-African route. It is uncertain whether the Langebaan population also follows this route, or travels around the coast.</p><p>When not breeding, Terek Sandpipers favour tidal estuaries with a muddy or fine, sandy substratum. On the south coast they usually occur in small parties with individual estuaries rarely holding more than 50 birds. Despite their small numbers, they are often sociable and prefer to remain in loose feeding associations. Owing to their greyish appearance they are often difficult to see against their normal background, and often the first that one notices of them are twinkling orange legs as they rush around after surface prey. They are very vocal both in flight and on the ground, and this can also draw one’s attention to their presence. In flight, the trailing white edge to the wing is fairly obvious, although not as contrasting as that of the Common Redshank, and at all times the longish, upturned bill is distinctive.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is a rather secretive bird that spends most of its time in thick undergrowth, and much of that on the ground, foraging in the leaf litter. In the non-breeding season it usually occurs in small groups of six to seven individuals. The presence of such a group can often be detected by the rustling sounds they make while hopping about and whisking leaves in the dry litter carpet. When they become aware of being watched or threatened, they break into a series of harsh, scolding, ratchet-like notes, and then slip silently away in the undergrowth. They are not easy to see.</p><p>Spending innumerable hours in forests watching African robins and robin-chats, all of which are primarily ground foragers, meant that I also got to see Terrestrial Brownbuls frequently. The nine species of robins in forest and woodland habitats in KwaZulu-Natal appear to share the food resources of the leaf-littered soil surface with several other kinds of birds, the most numerous of which is this brownbul. Were they all eating the same kind of things? Analyses of faecal samples and stomach contents revealed that there was indeed broad overlap. Like the robins and robin-chats, the Terrestrial Brownbuls ate lots of beetles, moths and caterpillars, crickets, termites, spiders, ants, plant bugs and small snails, and one had eaten an antlion larva. Where they differed from the robins was in the more frequent consumption of ‘fruit’. The frequency of this category in samples (87%) was higher than for any robin, as might be expected from a bulbul, but in many of the samples the fruit or seeds showed signs of germination, suggesting that they had been picked up off the ground beneath the leaf litter.</p><p>Spending innumerable hours in forests watching African robins and robin-chats, all of which are primarily ground foragers, meant that I also got to see Terrestrial Brownbuls frequently.

I had a hide at a pool in a forest stream where many birds came to drink or bathe. Brownbuls would come every evening, one at a time, to bathe. Contact with the water was always brief; the bird would jump in and splash hurriedly, then leap out onto a nearby twig and shake itself vigorously for some 10 seconds before jumping in again and repeating the procedure. One could not escape the impression that these brownbuls don’t like to get really wet.</p><p>Foraging groups of Terrestrial Brownbuls sometimes link up with mixed bird parties during the winter months, and though they still tend to keep to the undergrowth they occasionally ascend to scuffle among mats of leaf litter and other debris suspended in tangles of vines 10 m or more above the ground. They also associate with army ant columns, catching invertebrates that are fleeing the approach of the ant swarm, and they have been observed gleaning ticks from a Red Duiker.</p><p>Groups break up at the beginning of the breeding season. Age structure of groups is unknown, but data from ringed birds shows the species to be highly sedentary and fairly long-lived, with adult annual survival rates of about 74%. Any unmated and non-breeding group members presumably remain within the home range area as floaters.</p><p>The nest is generally a rather flimsy structure, usually sited no higher than one to two metres above the ground in a forked sapling or shrub. The female is a past master at slipping silently from the nest at the approach of an observer, but may become quite bold and vociferous if the observer dallies in the vicinity. Both parents attend the nestlings; after the young have fledged they may return to roost in the nest for a few nights.</p>",

In our region the males are a very dark chocolate colour, almost black, with a white forehead and white patches in the wings. Females are much lighter brown above, and pale below, flecked with brown. There is no seasonal plumage change. Thick-billed Weavers seem to be expanding their range in several regions, and are rapidly becoming urban birds in Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces in South Africa. In Zimbabwe they took advantage of the establishment of small dams with reed beds to colonise suburban Harare.</p><p>They show a marked shift in habitat between wetlands during the breeding season, and wooded or treed areas when not breeding, often occurring far from water. In East Africa, Thick-billed Weavers visit montane forest at 3 000 m. In Grahamstown, South Africa, they are often seen in the quadrangle outside the Rhodes University library during winter, feeding on the fruit of the exotic Celtis trees. Their bills can cope with sunflower seeds and hard seeds such as those from conifers, although they also feed on fruit, insects and other animal food – there are records of birds in Kenya eating aquatic snails and even a small frog.</p><p>They show a marked shift in habitat between wetlands during the breeding season, and wooded or treed areas when not breeding, often occurring far from water.

Their bills can cope with sunflower seeds and hard seeds such as those from conifers, although they also feed on fruit, insects and other animal food – there are records of birds in Kenya eating aquatic snails and even a small frog.</p><p>During their courtship display, males rotate their wings forward so that the white patches are visible. The nest is an incongruously neat construction for such a heavy-billed bird. It is neatly woven by the male from fine strips of material, shredded from grass, palm or bulrush leaves. The bulky oval structure is supported by vertical reeds or bulrushes and initially has a large side entrance. Males often strip leaves from plants around the nest, and remove the tops of reeds in the vicinity. Once a nest has been accepted by a female, the opening is closed to a small, round hole; both sexes may work on this, and the female adds lining material. The birds nest in small colonies, often in association with other weavers such as Southern Red Bishop, and each male may have up to six females during a single breeding season. As is generally the case in polygynous species, females are solely responsible for incubation, but males occasionally feed the young. At a study site in Pietermaritzburg, breeding success was &gt; 60% over two successive seasons, and notably higher than that of other weavers in the same habitat. A Dideric Cuckoo was seen removing an egg from one nest, but there have been no confirmed records of this cuckoo parasitising Thick-billed Weavers. Old nests may be occupied by climbing mice, and are also used for breeding by Orange-breasted Waxbills.</p><p>At South African colonies, males seem to return to the same sites each year, and ringing data have provided little information on their movements outside of the breeding season; one bird moved 130 km along the Eastern Cape coast. Thick-billed Weavers gather in large roosts which may contain hundreds of birds during the non-breeding season. The oldest bird recorded to date was more than eight years old.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>All Old World cuckoos are brood parasites, and have the habit of laying their eggs in other birds’ nests and leaving care of their offspring to the host species. This often elicits a negative response from humans, and adjectives like devious, surreptitious, deceptive and sneaky are sometimes used to describe cuckoos. The Thick-billed Cuckoo is perhaps particularly deserving of such epithets; indeed it adds more adjectives to our list – none of them complimentary.</p><p>The Thick-billed Cuckoo has only one recorded host in southern Africa, Retz’s Helmet-Shrike, which it parasitises very successfully. Carl Vernon recorded that over half of host nests were parasitised. Its laying behaviour is unique among southern African cuckoos. Despite the hosts continuously guarding their nests once incubation has commenced, the hawk-like female cuckoo knocks the incubating host from the nest. Before the host can return the cuckoo mantles over the nest, takes an egg in its bill (presumably laying at the same time) and flies off. Audacious? Blatant? Outrageous? All of the above? There is even one record of a female cuckoo evicting two seven-day-old host nestlings.</p><p>The Thick-billed Cuckoo has only one recorded host in southern Africa, Retz’s Helmet-Shrike, which it parasitises very successfully.

There is even one record of a female cuckoo evicting two seven-day-old host nestlings.</p><p>The Thick-billed Cuckoo’s approach to brood parasitism raises a number of interesting issues. The appearance of a hawk-like cuckoo at a host nest might help to elicit a flight reaction from the occupant, and this might explain why many cuckoos superficially resemble small accipiters. Although Retz’s Helmet-Shrike is gregarious, occurring in small cohesive flocks, the species seems unable to deter the cuckoo from commandeering its nest. By contrast, some hosts of other cuckoo species (for example, the Southern Red Bishop which is parasitised by the Dideric Cuckoo) nest colonially and minimise opportunities for parasitism by collectively detecting and chasing any cuckoos that attempt to enter the colony. Perhaps the much smaller size of the helmet-shrikes renders them helpless in the face of an incursion by the cuckoo, which is twice their size? The Thick-billed Cuckoo lays a matching egg, indistinguishable from those of the host, and removes one of the host eggs. Such precautions may seem unnecessary given its ‘daylight robbery’ approach, but the unfortunate hosts might be able to reject cuckoo eggs if they are easy to detect.</p><p>The Thick-billed Cuckoo is sparsely distributed throughout Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique, and is not on the life lists of many southern African birders. In South Africa, it occurs in small numbers in the Kruger National Park, Ndumo Game Reserve, and locally elsewhere in the lowveld. It reaches its western limit in Botswana’s Okavango Delta, where it has been recorded more frequently in recent years, so its range may be expanding to match that of its host.</p><p>Apart from its breeding ecology, the Thick-billed Cuckoo is poorly studied. Its diet is little known, except for the fact that it eats insects (most cuckoos are caterpillar specialists). It appears to be resident year-round in the southern African part of its range, with a December peak in Zimbabwe, which may however be an artefact of its more conspicuous behaviour during breeding than representing an actual influx of visitors. It is apparently polyandrous, with each female mating with more than one male. Once the chick is full-grown, the hosts feed it as long as it is perched, but the minute it flies off, they mob it, which raises interesting questions about the dynamics of chick acceptance and rejection. But answering such questions will require a special sort of birder – perhaps one who is slightly cuckoo!</p>",

It is widespread wherever suitable bodies of water are found, but is scarce in the driest regions of Botswana and Namibia and in mountainous country. This is essentially a southern African species extending north to southern Sudan, with a limited outlier population associated with Lake Chad and north-east Nigeria. It also occurs in Madagascar. Unlike the Kittlitz’s Plover it is a more solitary species and rarely occurs in numbers at any one site. This makes it very difficult to determine overall numbers in our region, and a best guess is that there are between 40&#160;000 and 70&#160;000 birds. There has been a great increase in numbers in response to the creation of artificial water impoundments, both large and small.</p><p>In southern Africa the bird is generally resident to nomadic to locally migratory in response to seasonal changes in water levels, but in Zimbabwe the majority of dry season visitors move out only to be replaced, presumably by birds from further north. These latter tend to concentrate at sewage disposal works where they often form communal roost sites with Common Sandpipers on the stony filter beds. Although some individuals may remain true to their breeding sites, the majority tend to be more nomadic, and where rainfall is more erratic the population may desert large areas during periods of drought. This may put considerable pressure on the regions where water levels are more constant, but in such drought periods the water levels in these latter areas are also likely to be lower, exposing greater amounts of suitable habitat for the increased numbers of these plovers. This was particularly noticeable in the bad drought of 1972/73 when large numbers moved into Zimbabwe and many more than usual bred successfully along the expanded shorelines of larger water bodies.</p><p>In southern Africa the bird is generally resident to nomadic to locally migratory in response to seasonal changes in water levels, but in Zimbabwe the majority of dry season visitors move out only to be replaced, presumably by birds from further north.

During the day the male tours his territory ensuring that no other of his species enters the area whereas at night he welcomes others to roost there, presumably because the extra birds act as an early warning system against predators patrolling the beaches. These birds prefer to breed on patches of shingle or gravel where their normally conspicuous head pattern acts as a good camouflage. They collect small pebbles with which to line the nest scrape. The young are precocious when hatched, but remain at the nest site for the first 24 hours before starting to feed. Chicks appear to be mainly in the charge of the male, and sometimes the female will re-lay while the young are still under parental care. Once they are fledged they are on their own and quickly depart the home area. At a study in Zimbabwe it was found that the earliest bred young appeared to have the highest survival rate and were more likely to return to the natal area in later seasons. A proportion of these yearlings may breed, but the remainder wait until their second season before embarking on parenthood.</p>",

This is the only courser that partially buries its eggs which are never turned, as is the norm. Evidently incubation from one side is adequate as the soil acts as an incubator when the adults are absent. The sitting bird remains on the nest until the last moment, relying on its cryptic plumage to avoid recognition, springing directly into flight from its nest. Presumably the partially buried eggs are sufficiently camouflaged to miss normal detection.</p>",

The bird has a remarkable resemblance to the Yellow-streaked Greenbul, but is very much smaller.</p><p>I have only encountered this species in the Haroni-Rusitu Valley in eastern Zimbabwe where it was remarkably common. Knowing the bird’s contact call, which is a distinctive husky ‘j-jwr-jwrr-jwrrrit’, we tracked it down in the tangled understorey.  Standing in the forest we were aware that these birds were all around us although they were not really visible.

They are smaller than Wandering Albatrosses, and breed in a darker plumage, but there are no reliable characters for separating the two species at sea. As a result, their status in southern African waters is poorly known.

Indeed, both of these birds were originally thought to be different races of the same species. They do look similar and sound similar, but the Tropical Boubou has its white underparts tinged pinkish, instead of rufous, which characterises members of the Southern Boubou species, and in further contrast to the latter, male and female plumages are alike in the Tropical Boubou. Some northern races of the Tropical Boubou have recently been elevated to full specific status, so what appeared to be a single species with several geographic races is now known to be a species complex of lookalike birds.</p><p>The vocalisations of the Tropical Boubou vary regionally (as do those of the Southern Boubou), and the large repertoire of calls of these shrikes allows for multiple versions of their antiphonal duets, which are characteristic sounds of bush and forest fringe throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. Sometimes the female uses a harsh snarl call in her part of the duet, and one sunny morning I heard such a version emanating from a forested ravine on the flank of Gorongosa Mountain in Mozambique. The nature and loudness of such duets are dramatic and never fail to attract one’s attention. One observer has described the snarl call as sounding like ‘the passing of a whetstone across the blade of a scythe’. Many of the Tropical Boubou’s fluting whistles do indeed have a metallic tone. The snarl is not peculiar to the female, and given that one can seldom view the performers of the duets, one needs to bear in mind that, in the absence of participation by his mate, the male boubou can perform the duet perfectly all by himself.</p><p>The vocalisations of the Tropical Boubou vary regionally (as do those of the Southern Boubou), and the large repertoire of calls of these shrikes allows for multiple versions of their antiphonal duets, which are characteristic sounds of bush and forest fringe throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa.

They forage in dense foliage and on tree trunks, probing crevices in bark, or on the ground under thickets, ‘fossicking’ in leaf litter, not whisking it sideways like a thrush, but rather turning over a large leaf. Insects dominate their prey, but they eat anything they come across which is small enough for them to seize and carry, including small vertebrates such as tree frogs, chameleons, lizards, nestling birds and small snakes. Large items may be wedged into the fork of a twig so that the bird can dismember the prey more easily. Like the Southern Boubou, they occasionally also eat small fruits and small snails. They attend army-ant columns, capturing prey fleeing the marauding ants, and they will forsake cover to feed on emergent termite alates, even hawking them in flight.</p><p>Tropical Boubous roost in dense vegetation and their nests are well concealed in dense foliage, although they are sometimes built in isolated trees. Like the Southern Boubou, the Tropical Boubou is a favoured host of the Black Cuckoo, with over two per cent of nests being parasitised. This is quite a high level of brood parasitism, but does not appear to unduly impact the breeding success of the shrikes. However, some pairs have been reported to be repeatedly parasitised in the same season, which doubtless affects their fitness. Young birds are fed for several weeks after leaving the nest, and tend to remain on their parent’s territory for around five months before dispersing. The longevity record for the Tropical Boubou is 9-10 years.</p>",

The taxonomic waters were further muddied when juveniles of Tropical Shearwater were described as a new species, the ‘Mascarene Shearwater’ P. atrodorsalis.

Its pre-eminent feature is, however, the loud wailing call from which the name ‘trumpeter’ is derived. It has been variously likened to a braying donkey or a bawling child. While feeding, the birds keep in contact with one another with a quiet, chirring call.</p><p>The birds have black plumage, offset with white on the belly and on the trailing edge of the wings and the rump. This black and white pattern makes them conspicuous when they fly. The only real possibility of confusion is with the even larger Silvery-cheeked Hornbill, which in our region is confined to the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique. Trumpeter Hornbills have a large beak with bare, red skin around the eye.

Trumpeter Hornbills have a large beak with bare, red skin around the eye. The male has a large casque on top of the bill while the female has a much smaller casque and less red around the eye.</p><p>In the south they are found in patches of coastal lowland forest, particularly along rivers, and have become quite common and confiding in well-wooded suburbs. Farther north they are found further inland in patches of forest along the scarps and even up into the mountains in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. They also occur extensively in woodlands along the Zambezi Valley. They are strong flyers and are able to cross patches of open country from one forest to the next.</p><p>They are essentially fruit eaters and are usually found in association with fruiting trees such as wild figs. They often spend the day in the same tree if there is a plentiful supply of ripe fruit.  After eating their fill, they retreat to thicker vegetation to digest their haul before returning for another feast. They eat the fruit from a very large variety of trees but also take a range of animal prey such as millipedes, wasps, caterpillars, spiders and even birds’ eggs and nestlings.</p><p>The Trumpeter Hornbill is a fairly large bird and therefore requires a large tree hole in which to nest. Pairs normally have their nest at the centre of their territory. This area is defended throughout the year and, when nesting, the male defends the territory against other hornbills. The female retreats to the nest after mating and seals the hole with bits of mud brought by the male and which is mixed with her faeces and bits of food. The male provides nest lining in the form of bark flakes or small sticks. The female lays her first egg about ten to fifteen days after entering the nest and then another two or three eggs are laid on subsequent days. Because incubation starts with the first egg, the chicks hatch asynchronously and are of varying sizes, which maximises chick production in years when food is scarce.</p><p>Nico Myburgh had a hide at a nest in a forest near his home in KwaZulu-Natal where he photographed the male bringing the food to the female. He noticed that there were in fact two males with different lengths of white on their tails, feeding the female in the nest. However it is thought that most Trumpeter Hornbill pairs do not have helpers at the nest. The first egg hatches after about 25 days, the female remains in the nest until the eldest chick is approximately 25 days old, thereafter helping the male to feed the chicks. Nico Myburgh recorded that once the chicks of his group of Trumpeter Hornbills had left the nest,  the birds sealed the entrance to the nest hole completely, possibly to stop bees getting into the nest during the non-breeding season.</p>",

The lower breast and belly are bright yellow, which is the outstanding feature of this species. The female is brown, with a lighter eye-stripe.

Over the following three or four years they became typical garden birds throughout the district and even started colonising the thickets of thorn bush and asparagus fern found along stream lines on the plateau of the Marondera area. Over the years the bird has spread westwards along the watershed to Harare and further west, usually colonising gardens first and then gradually spreading into the surrounding areas. It was noticeable that they liked to have thorny creepers on which to hang their nest, and the introduction of Mauritian thorn around the fences of many farm gardens resulted in these birds finding the ideal protected nest site and consequently becoming locally more common.

When breeding starts in spring, however, the male sings almost continuously from a conspicuous perch.  The song is a fairly melodious twitter or series of whistles ‘chewip chewip ti-ti-ti-ti-ti’. They also have a three-note contact call ‘tsiu-tse-tse’.</p><p>In the natural environment the birds are typical of the wetter areas, particularly in rank growth in moist situations such as marshes. However, they do extend into the surrounding woodlands, especially if there are thorny thickets beneath the trees. This usually only occurs where the woodlands are open, with gaps between the tree canopies.</p><p>Although we considered this species to be resident, ringing showed that there was a certain amount of movement through our garden. The birds clearly moved around in response to available nectar sources, because they would come in large numbers to the flowering Coffee Shade Trees Acrocarpus fraxinifolius in our garden. It was notable, however, that we never had more than one pair of birds at a time breeding in the garden. We often found this species present in the mixed-species bird parties in the woodlands at Peterhouse.</p><p>The birds build a typical sunbird-shaped nest with the entrance on the side near the top, with a very conspicuous roof or porch over the entrance. All the nests that I saw were low down, less than two metres above the ground in thorny bushes or creepers. The birds nested regularly in the rose bushes in the garden. Only the female constructed the nest, but the male usually moved backwards and forwards with her as she collected the nest material. In fact, at times it almost looked as though he was harassing her as she built! The female did all the incubation of the eggs but once the eggs had hatched the male would feed the chicks. At one nest in our garden the male fed the chicks about twice as often as the female, which was interesting, but very unusual.</p>",

Many birders’ first experience with this bird nowadays is seeing one of these city dwellers – either the pair that has bred for several decades at the Botanical Gardens at Roodepoort, or the pair that nests at Wonderboom overlooking Pretoria and a stone’s throw from the last row of houses, or Cape Town’s Silvermine pair, or the other pair nesting below Table Mountain’s cable car. It is hard to credit that these are the selfsame birds that populate the remote granite dwalas of the Matobos or the inselbergs and scarps of the arid Karoo. City birds look the same as these wilderness birds but they are somehow not imbued with the same mystique.</p><p>What the city birds do, though, is create public awareness in a way that those in the Karoo would never do. Webcams at nests have given viewers an intimate insight into this splendid eagle’s nesting cycle, from repairing the nest to coaxing the full-grown chick to leave. They also provide a kind of outdoor laboratory for studying aspects of the bird’s behaviour such as responses to food availability, not easily achieved in remote-living, non-habituated birds. And this in turn, hopefully, instils an appreciation of the bird that may ultimately benefit its survival in a changing world and a burgeoning human population.</p><p>What the city birds do, though, is create public awareness in a way that those in the Karoo would never do.

And this in turn, hopefully, instils an appreciation of the bird that may ultimately benefit its survival in a changing world and a burgeoning human population.</p><p>Verreaux’s Eagles are not regarded as threatened in southern Africa, although there are areas where their numbers have diminished. The Magaliesberg range west of Pretoria, for example, supported 13 pairs in the 1980s but only half this number lives there now. The key to their survival is their affinity for rocky mountainous country and their specialist diet of hyrax (‘dassies’). Mountains have escaped much of the transformation seen in other areas resulting from agriculture, human settlement, afforestation and so on and, provided hyraxes are present and they have a secure breeding site, the eagles will also mostly be present. Dassies are often hunted by the eagles in a team effort, one distracting the intended victim while the other sweeps in to catch it, and the sight of a pair flying at speed in tandem, hugging a steep slope as they hunt is thrilling to watch.</p><p>The densest Verreaux’s Eagle population in the region occurs in the Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe where, until recently, 50 or more pairs occurred. This population has been monitored for over 50 years, providing one of the longest and most detailed studies of any eagle in the world. Here pairs maintain permanent pair bonds, live in the same territories year-round and breed, on average, in two years out of three, using the same nest, or one of a few alternatives, annually.</p><p>In April before they lay their eggs, the nest, which grows in size with each year of use, is copiously lined with green tree leaves and these continue to be added throughout the nesting cycle. Two eggs comprise the normal clutch and they are laid 3-4 days apart which has major consequences later in the cycle. The female does most of the incubation, and she is provisioned by the male who may take short incubation stints while she feeds. The second-laid egg hatches 2-3 days later than the first, and the first-hatched chick’s aggression towards its sibling almost invariably results in the latter’s early death. Known as siblicide or cainism, it occurs commonly in large eagles and is especially well documented in Verreaux’s Eagle. Explanations for cainism vary, one being that the second-laid egg is no more than an insurance policy in case the first fails to hatch.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl is one of several names given to this large owl, not a very good name since the bird was neither discovered nor described by either of the French naturalist brothers Verreaux. It is Africa’s largest owl and until recently was known across southern Africa as the Giant Eagle-Owl and elsewhere in Africa as the Milky Eagle-Owl, this latter name derived from its scientific name lacteus. It is a giant of an owl, with powerful feet and talons, and it is a formidable predator, the range of prey it takes ranking it as the nocturnal equivalent of, say, the Martial Eagle. Its range extends across most of the savanna belt of sub-Saharan Africa and it is easily identified by its pale greyish plumage with finely barred underparts, its broad white facial discs bordered by black edges, its dark brown eyes and, uniquely, by its fetching pink eyelids.</p><p>Although primarily a savanna species, a handful of pairs extend westwards into the eastern and southern Cape, living here in stands of eucalypt or in copses of other tall trees. Never abundant, these owls are everywhere thin on the ground; even in ideal habitat adjacent pairs are spaced 5-15 km apart. They are sedentary birds, probably remaining paired for life once adult, and during the day one commonly finds the pair roosting together, even sitting side by side, in the high branches of a well-foliaged tree. The birds show great reluctance to move if they are disturbed at these daytime roost sites, and should they take to flight they are invariably set upon by drongos, crows or any small raptor that happens to be in the vicinity; once the alarm has been raised there is unlikely to be much peace for them for the rest of the day.</p><p>Although primarily a savanna species, a handful of pairs extend westwards into the eastern and southern Cape, living here in stands of eucalypt or in copses of other tall trees.

Exceptional victims include Secretarybird, Banded Harrier-Hawk, Black-headed Heron, Steppe Buzzard, Barn Owl, Spotted Eagle-Owl and Warthog, but the range of prey extends from these to termites, shrews, lizards and frogs. In places hedgehogs form a significant part of the diet, their peeled-off spiny skins being discarded and left as evidence on the ground below the roost. Prey is sought from a perch and is caught by swooping in with talons extended; prey items such as the Secretarybird were probably taken unawares while sleeping at night.</p><p>Verreaux’s Eagle-Owls have an unmistakable, far-carrying call that is audible, on a still night, from a distance of several kilometres. It is a series of low-pitched grunts, pig-like in gruffness, uttered at closely spaced intervals, the male usually initiating a spell of calling with three notes ‘uh, uh-uh’ and the female joining in and talking over him ‘uh, uh, uhuhuh, uh uh’. A pause, then one or both birds repeats the grunting, continuing this way for ten minutes or longer. Dawn and dusk are prime calling times but the birds may be heard throughout the night; late summer, just prior to the breeding season, is when calling peaks.</p><p>In common with most other owls, these birds do not make their own nest but make use of an existing one, often taking over the old nest of an eagle or vulture and, in instances, usurping an active nest from its original owners. In the Kalahari they often breed on top of Sociable Weaver nests and where they occur, Hamerkop nests are much favoured, the owls nesting on top while the Hamerkops may even continue nesting inside. As expected for such a large bird, the breeding cycle is protracted, with egg-laying occurring in early winter and the chick only fledging three to four months later.</p>",

It is also one of the most difficult birds to find unless they are breeding and one can track down their calls. In spring the birds become territorial and the male will call repeatedly, usually from a concealed position within the thicket. The call is a series of notes which are repeated again and again ‘tsiwip, tsee-tsee’. The male may respond to a recording, but even then he is likely to sneak through the thicket and check for the intruder without revealing himself. But then every now and again I find one which is able to give that ‘Hollywood’ pose – turning around right out in the open, so that we can see both sides, the back and the front!</p><p>This medium-sized warbler is slaty-brown at the top of the head, ears and nape, and the rest of the upperparts are dark reddish-brown. The chin is orange-brown and the remainder of the breast and underparts are cinnamon-brown.</p><p>This medium-sized warbler is slaty-brown at the top of the head, ears and nape, and the rest of the upperparts are dark reddish-brown. The chin is orange-brown and the remainder of the breast and underparts are cinnamon-brown.</p><p>It is restricted to the Cape fold-mountain ranges from the Cedarberg Mountains in the Western Cape to Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape. It is usually found in the wetter vegetation on the edge of the Afromontane forests where there are plenty of thickets of bracken, ferns and grass. It is also found in coastal bush and in dense fynbos. Although the Knysna Warbler, which occurs alongside this species may be found in urban gardens, I have never seen the Victorin’s Warbler in a garden. Given the right conditions this species can be common, although, unless they are calling, one would never know that because it is such a secretive bird.</p><p>It spends most of its time foraging on the ground or near the ground looking for insects, including caterpillars. While foraging they are usually very quiet, but sometimes one can hear them moving around if the ground litter is dry.</p><p>The birds build a deep thick-walled nest, usually on the ground or against a bank with plenty of cover above the nest. The nest is built mainly by the female who seldom goes far from the nest to find material for building. The nests can take up to three or four weeks to complete and probably involves several thousand collecting trips! Most nests are built in August to September so peak laying is in September to November. The eggs take up to 21 days to hatch into pink-skinned chicks which gradually get covered with down and then feathers. Once the eggs hatch the chicks are fed by both male and female, and it is interesting to see the birds coming in one after the other very rapidly in the early part of the day to provision the chicks. Later they visited the nest about 6 to 8 times per hour. They always approached the nest along the ground under cover of the dense vegetation around the nest.  &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In most of our region, males of this species are distinguished by their red bill and legs; white-billed birds that could be confused with male Dusky Indigobird are found in the extreme north-west in Botswana and the Zambezi Region  of Namibia, but their range does not overlap with Dusky Indigobirds. Studies in Zambia suggest that many juvenile birds disperse from their natal area, and that about 20% of breeding males move from one season to another. Regional differences in song suggested that Village Indigobird populations might be separated on song characteristics, but these dialects do not seem to prevent interbreeding between individuals from different regions. Rather, male birds dispersing to a new area adjust their song characteristics to match those of the new neighbours. Some ringed males have survived at least six years. During the non-breeding season they form flocks with conspecifics, other Vidua species and waxbills; even while in breeding plumage, males may feed on the ground alongside their usual host species, the Red-billed Firefinch. There appears to be little enmity between host and parasite in such associations.</p><p>Male Village Indigobirds defend territories surrounding an elevated perch, which serves as a song post. Males of other Vidua species are chased out of the territory, but female-plumaged birds and even unrelated birds may be courted apparently indiscriminately. During the breeding season, the male sings for much of the day, with a repertoire of more than 20 song types, some of which incorporate mimicry of the song and calls of the host species. Females visit and listen to several different males, but most of the successful matings are performed by a small proportion of males.  If a female approaches, the male performs a hovering display in front of her, and then attempts to land for copulation. Males are polygynous, mating with as many females as possible, but it is not clear if females mate with more than one male in a single season.</p><p>Male Village Indigobirds defend territories surrounding an elevated perch, which serves as a song post.

Where more than one parasite egg is found in a host nest, these may come from different females, or from the same female, as one individual was seen to lay four eggs in a nest. Each female lays up to 26 eggs in a single breeding season. The mouth markings of the young indigobird match those of the Red-billed Firefinch host very closely, and generally the chicks of the two species are raised together. A classic field study in Senegal indicated that raising extra young normally has little detrimental effect on the host species, but in poor seasons the Red-billed Firefinch may suffer reduced breeding success. About 20% of Village Indigobird eggs in Senegal produced flying young.</p><p>In southern Africa, the Red-billed Firefinch is the primary host, but the Brown Firefinch has also been recorded as a host in Zimbabwe, and this is the likely host of the white-billed population in the Okavango region. A male has been heard mimicking the song of African Firefinch, and another the song of Jameson’s Firefinch, suggesting that they were raised by these species. Cross-fostering experiments with captive birds have shown that male Village Indigobirds are able to imitate the songs of other firefinch species if raised by them, while females will select nests of their foster species to lay their eggs. It is likely that occasional ‘errors’ occur under natural conditions where several species of potential hosts nest close together.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>For the southern African populations, the old common name ‘Spotted-backed Weaver’ is appropriate, since this species is not especially associated with villages in our region, and the boldly patterned back is characteristic of breeding males. However, elsewhere in Africa it often frequents human settlements, and some populations have plain backs. Even in southern Africa there is marked geographic variation, with males north of the Limpopo River having wholly black heads, whereas southern populations have a yellow crown. West African birds have been introduced to the West Indies, while birds from southern Africa are established on Mauritius and Reunion. Like most colonial weavers, males change from dull non-breeding dress to colourful nuptial plumage. Females are also more brightly-coloured during the breeding season, and breeding birds of both sexes usually have red eyes. However, only males develop a completely black bill, and they do not moult into breeding plumage until their second year, whereas most females breed at one year old.</p><p>Village Weavers eat a wide variety of seeds, and to the north of our area can be significant pests on rice and other cereal crops. They may form very large flocks after breeding, often associating with other weavers and Red-billed Queleas. Individual males have been recaptured at the same colonies more than ten years after ringing, and to date no birds have been recorded further than 100 km from the original ringing site. In captivity, some birds lived for 24 years, but breeding activity declined markedly after ten years.</p><p>Village Weavers eat a wide variety of seeds, and to the north of our area can be significant pests on rice and other cereal crops.

In captivity, some birds lived for 24 years, but breeding activity declined markedly after ten years.</p><p>Village Weavers have been studied extensively, both in the field and in aviaries. Males are highly polygynous, with up to five females in the territory at the same time, and up to seven mates during the course of a season. Females may change mates between successive breeding attempts, with one ringed female mated to three different males. Aggressive displays, directed at male intruders, highlight the black face mask, whereas the yellow areas of the plumage are more prominently displayed during courtship. Males display by hanging below their nest, calling loudly while swivelling with their wings and tail spread. Bursts of display spread through the colony when a female arrives.</p><p>The outer structure of the nest is woven by the male from strips of grass, reed or palm leaves, with extra leaves, often from trees, added to the roofing layer. The entrance is on the underside, and sometimes has a short tunnel. Once the female has accepted a nest, she lines it with grass seedheads, small leaves and feathers. Nests which do not attract a female are destroyed by the male and often replaced with a new nest at the same site – at the tip of a drooping branch, or supported at the sides by vertical reeds. One male may build as many as 20 nests during a season. Nests in reed beds may be within one metre of the water, or up to 30 m above ground when in large forest trees. There can be 200 nests in a single tree, and 1&#160;000 in a large breeding colony.</p><p>The female is entirely responsible for incubation, and usually also for feeding the nestlings, although some males will assist in feeding the chicks. Village Weavers are regular hosts of the Dideric Cuckoo, and individual differences in weaver egg colouration may represent an adaptation to detect potential cuckoo eggs. However, intraspecific nest parasitism, with other weavers in the colony laying eggs in neighbouring nests, could also favour female-specific egg colouration. Nest predation is often heavy, with snakes, crows and raptors such as the African Harrier-Hawk and Gabar Goshawk destroying many nests.</p>",

The male is glossy purple from the top of the head down the back to the tail, and the wings and front of the neck are all purple or violet, depending on the direction of the light. Underneath, from the bottom of the neck to the vent, the male is a clean white. The female is exactly the same size and shape as the male, but is a brown bird with a rufous crown, and the white from the base of the bill to the vent is streaked with brown on breast and upper belly. Both birds have bright yellow eyes. Because they are usually seen together, the difference in the sexes helps to make identification certain. Like our other glossy starlings, the iridescent feathers of the male change colour, from almost black to the brightest violet or purple, depending on the way in which the light strikes the plumage.</p><p>These birds are widespread in the savanna and riverine woodlands of Africa south of the Sahara. In southern Africa they occur over much of the northern half of our area extending south into KwaZulu-Natal. They appear to be found in the central Kalahari when weather conditions are right. In Zimbabwe the birds are resident but in other areas they are migratory, with birds moving south from the tropics.</p><p>These birds are widespread in the savanna and riverine woodlands of Africa south of the Sahara.

These flocks are usually fairly small, but towards the end of summer the birds may gather in flocks of hundreds. The flocks can also be very large where wild fig trees with small-sized figs are in fruit. At this time in Zimbabwe we used to get hundreds of birds coming to feed on the Red-leaved Fig Ficus ingens, which was common in the woodland near our house. These starlings are also regular members of the groups of birds which gather at the hatches of termite alates. They glean a variety of insects from the leaves of trees, but if fruit is available they will usually go to the fruiting tree rather than search for insects. However, they do feed their chicks a lot of insects.</p><p>The Violet-backed Starling nests in a hole in a tree, but because it cannot excavate its own hole it is obviously dependent on the availability of natural holes or the abandoned holes of birds such as woodpeckers and barbets. It is noteworthy that they often make use of hollow fence posts, the steel type being particularly favoured, because they have the right diameter and in many cases gives the starlings breeding opportunities in areas where no natural holes occur in trees. The eggs are laid in a cup-shaped nest which the birds build at the bottom of the hole. This species also made extensive use of nest boxes which we put up at Peterhouse, Marondera, generally preferring natural rot holes in pieces of tree trunk to woodpecker or barbet holes excavated in bits of sisal. It would appear that the female did most, if not all, of the incubation because the male fed her during this stage. However, once the chicks had hatched, both the male and female fed the chicks equally. When the chicks were large enough and strong enough to scramble up to the nest-hole entrance, they would stick their heads out waiting to be fed</p>",

Fortunately this does not seem to constitute a threat to its populations in our region. Although it occurs in arid areas such as the central Kalahari, this species drinks regularly where water is available, and seems to be less nomadic than other seedeaters in this habitat. The birds usually arrive at the water in pairs, except in late summer when they may be accompanied by juveniles. At these drinking sites they join up with other pairs and different waxbill species, particularly Blue and Black-cheeked Waxbills. Foraging usually in pairs or small groups, Violet-eared Waxbills also join up with other species, particularly Blue Waxbills. In addition to grass seeds and various insects, they also take nectar and small fruits. This bird often seems to be associated with acacia veld, even on the Zimbabwe plateau where broad-leaved trees are the norm. This may be related to the grasses growing among the acacia trees, rather than any dependence on the trees themselves. Ringing studies show that a high proportion of the birds are recaptured at the same site over an extended period, while the oldest bird on record was more than eight years old.</p><p>Based on studies of captive birds, Violet-eared Waxbills may establish a life-long pair bond, and pair formation appears to start while a few months old when still in immature plumage. Surprisingly, their courtship displays seem to be less well documented than for many other waxbill species, but Violet-eared Waxbills are difficult to keep and breed in captivity; members of a pair allopreen the head area of their partners regularly. Males have a complex song, and females may counter-sing in response with a short song. During display flights, both sexes produce a distinctive buzzing sound with their wings. In the perched display, the male carries a grass stem or feather in his bill, accompanied by bobbing movements and the erection of feathers on the crown.</p><p>Based on studies of captive birds, Violet-eared Waxbills may establish a life-long pair bond, and pair formation appears to start while a few months old when still in immature plumage.

Both sexes build the nest, a ball of dry grass placed one to two metres above the ground in a shrub or tree, with a round side entrance usually facing into the centre of the bush. Fine grass is added to the interior, but the lining is mostly composed of large contour feathers from birds such as Helmeted Guineafowl. The pair continues to bring feathers to the nest while incubating and feeding the young. Insect food seems to be especially important for successful development of the chicks. Once the young fledge, the male feeds them more often than the female. The fledglings allopreen each other, and begin to sing when little more than one month old. Violet-eared Waxbills are the primary host of the brood parasitic Shaft-tailed Whydah, and in some areas a large proportion of their nests may be para&#173;sitised. The whydahs then learn the song of their host, which they in turn use during their courtship displays.</p>",

Until the 1960s it went unnoticed that Wahlberg’s Eagles were migratory but when it became apparent that they disappeared in winter, where they went became the subject of much speculation. The answer was only provided in 1995 when a bird, one of a pair nesting in northern Namibia, was fitted with a transmitter and its long journey was tracked. It left the nesting area in March and headed north across Angola, flying 3 500 km to its first destination in northern Cameroons. Then, during the next three months, it wandered widely between Nigeria and southern Sudan before turning south in August to start its return migration.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s Wahlberg’s Eagles were certainly the commonest eagles nesting around Nylsvley Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province where I lived, and I knew of 21 different nesting pairs here. Individual birds in this species are very variable in their colouring, some being dark brown, others buff-coloured and a few are almost white, and because of this many of the individuals in this population were recognisable. Their arrival in early spring was heralded by their aerial calling, a drawn-out two-syllable whistle and, when perched near the nest, by a yelping ‘kop, yop, yip-yip-yip’. I monitored their numbers over two decades, checking the nest sites each spring and recording which pairs reared young and which didn’t. But, during this period their numbers started declining, first to 18 pairs, then to 12 until by the late 1980s there remained only one or two pairs.

Individual birds in this species are very variable in their colouring, some being dark brown, others buff-coloured and a few are almost white, and because of this many of the individuals in this population were recognisable. Their arrival in early spring was heralded by their aerial calling, a drawn-out two-syllable whistle and, when perched near the nest, by a yelping ‘kop, yop, yip-yip-yip’. I monitored their numbers over two decades, checking the nest sites each spring and recording which pairs reared young and which didn’t. But, during this period their numbers started declining, first to 18 pairs, then to 12 until by the late 1980s there remained only one or two pairs.  All three pairs in the nature reserve disappeared and to this day have never been replaced.</p><p>What happened? My conclusion is that they were victims of secondary poisoning, firstly from poisoned meat baits set out in the veld to kill jackals, and secondly from preying on queleas which had been subject to aerial spraying. Right after one particular quelea spraying campaign (that left dead and dying queleas strewn everywhere) I picked up a dead Wahlberg’s Eagle, a bird I’d followed for 11 years and easily recognised by his blonde plumage. His last meal, still undigested in his crop, was one of the poisoned queleas, sprayed the previous night in the reed beds in Nylsvley with Parathion. Quelea control in those years decimated queleas – an estimated 238 million queleas were killed this way between1979-1984 – but it decimated raptor numbers too and, at least around Nylsvley, these eagles have never recovered.</p><p>So it is always a relief to visit the Kruger National Park in summer and continue to see Wahlberg’s Eagles in good numbers. Studies done here show that, as they once were at Nylsvley, territorial pairs are spaced out across the savanna at a density of a little under 1 000 hectares per pair. Some pairs return annually to the same nest, others build a new nest on their arrival, and by early October the incubation of the single egg laid is well under way. Occasionally pairs lay a clutch of two, and my blonde male was part of one such pair. The female undertakes most of the 44-day incubation, assisted to a small extent by her mate, and she is also provided with food by him. Just-hatched chicks are covered with chocolate-brown down when they hatch, with the exception of birds that grow up to be blondes, which are buff-coloured at hatching. The cycle from laying to fledging spans three months, and by mid-January most youngsters are on the wing; a month or two later the wheel turns the full circle and adults and offspring set off on their northern migration.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Wailing Cisticola owes its name to the high, drawn-out whistles it produces, a sound that is familiar to keen hikers and mountaineers. In addition to wailing, the vocal repertoire of this species includes a great variety of bubbling trills, repeated whistles, sneezing sounds, low chattering, raspy screeches and more. It can be heard year-round, but is most vociferous during the summer breeding season when males sing from prominent rocks or the tops of shrubs. The main territorial song is a low bubbling trill followed by several high whistles, and variations on this theme.</p><p>The identification of cisticolas, and all LBJs for that matter, can be greatly simplified by considering the two elemental aspects of distribution and habitat. In the case of the Wailing Cisticola, you are unlikely to encounter this species away from the grass-cloaked slopes of hills and mountains, whether near sea level or on the high peaks of Lesotho. It is especially fond of areas with scattered rocks and shrubs, perhaps with banks of ferns or other forms of low rank cover. To a lesser extent, it is also found at the edges of Afromontane forest fragments. In terms of distribution, the Wailing Cisticola extends from George in the Western Cape throughout the moister, higher-lying eastern half of South Africa, excluding the Lowveld and Bushveld regions. A smaller isolated population is restricted to Zimbabwe’s mountainous eastern border and the nearby Gorongosa massif in Mozambique. Beyond our borders, it also occurs in Angola, Zambia, Malawi and southern Tanzania.</p><p>The identification of cisticolas, and all LBJs for that matter, can be greatly simplified by considering the two elemental aspects of distribution and habitat.

Beyond our borders, it also occurs in Angola, Zambia, Malawi and southern Tanzania.</p><p>It is not only field birders who struggle with cisticolas: laboratory-based ornithologists might have the luxury of examining specimens in the hand, but cannot hear the bird’s voice or witness its behaviour. In an attempt to make sense of the bewildering amount of individual, regional, sexual and seasonal variation in the plumage of cisticolas, researchers have subdivided them into a myriad subspecies. Differences between such subspecies may be very subtle, and often constitute clinal changes – gradual transitions between adjacent popu&#173;lations, with intermediate forms that could fit in either category.</p><p>Keeping these limitations in mind, identifying birds to subspecies level adds a new dimension to birding – for example, Wailing Cisticolas of the Eastern Cape maculatus subspecies show variably streaked breasts, absent in the four more northerly subspecies. A larger, darker form restricted to Kenya and Uganda was previously considered a subspecies of Wailing, but is now listed as a separate species altogether: Lynes’s Cisticola C. distinctus, after the celebrated cisticola expert of that name.</p><p>Like its relatives, the Wailing Cisticola spends much time hunting insects on the ground amongst rocks, shrubs and grass tufts, or clambering about in low vegetation. It can be frustratingly furtive and elusive unless calling, when it typically ascends to some higher perch. The nest is constructed close to the ground (usually less than 15&#160;cm up) and is surreptitiously hidden inside a grass tussock or dense bush. It is an upright, oval-shaped structure with an entrance near the top of one side. It is constructed of grass strips that are bound with spider web. Surrounding live grass blades may be used to further enhance the nest’s concealment. Typical clutches contain three to four eggs that vary considerably in appearance, as in most other cisticolas; eggs can show whitish, pale brown or blue background hues, overlaid with speckles and blotches ranging from very bold to almost invisible.&#9;&#160;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The iconic Wandering Albatross is renowned for having the greatest wingspan of any living bird. If seen from a small boat off the Cape, it appears somewhat lumbering and hump-backed compared to the smaller albatrosses. To fully appreciate it, you have to see one soaring majestically in a Southern Ocean gale, when it makes the other birds appear light and flimsy. Its extremely long wings allow it to cover vast distances with little effort, attaining speeds in excess of 100 kilometres per hour at times. However, its long wings do compromise its ability to dive, and it rarely takes prey from more than a metre below the sea surface.</p><p>Because of their large size and rather placid nature, the at-sea behaviour of Wandering Albatrosses has been studied intensively using a variety of devices attached to or implanted into the birds. Satellite transmitters, GPS loggers and geolocators give insights into their movements at sea. As a result we know that most Wandering Albatrosses from South Africa’s Marion Island remain within the southern Indian and South Atlantic Oceans during their ‘sabbatical’ year off following a successful breeding attempt, but some birds travel right around the Southern Ocean. Fitting Wandering Albatrosses with a heart-rate monitor confirms that dynamic soaring requires little effort; while soaring, their heart rate is similar to that of resting birds. However, taking off is more costly, especially in low wind conditions. Stomach temperature probes allow scientists to know when feeding takes place, because their prey is colder than their body temperature. We can even infer how large each meal is by the magnitude of the temperature drop and the time taken for stomach temperature to recover. We thus know that Wandering Albatrosses obtain most of their food during the day, mostly large squid that float when they are dead or dying, but they also catch some small squid at night.</p><p>Because of their large size and rather placid nature, the at-sea behaviour of Wandering Albatrosses has been studied intensively using a variety of devices attached to or implanted into the birds.

Juveniles are mostly brown, becoming progressively paler with each successive moult, and with males whitening faster than females. The group’s taxonomy has been revised recently, splitting off the smaller, darker, northern-breeding populations, so that the Wandering Albatross is now restricted to the large, pale southern form that breeds on South Georgia and sub-Antarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean. More than 40 per cent of the world population breeds at South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands. Eggs are laid in midsummer, hatch in autumn, and the chicks fledge the following spring. This protracted breeding cycle prevents most pairs from raising more than one chick every two years. Following a successful breeding attempt, most individuals spend a year at sea, moulting and recovering their body condition – the ‘sabbatical’ year.</p><p>Wandering Albatrosses are becoming increasingly rare at the shelf break off southern Africa, but remain fairly common in oceanic waters farther offshore. They are inveterate ship-followers, remaining with a vessel for hours, if not days, on end, but they tend to avoid the dense melees behind trawlers off the southern African coast. They are listed as Vulnerable due to ongoing population decreases, especially at South Georgia, where numbers have fallen consistently since the 1960s. Fortunately, their numbers have been stable or have increased over the last few decades at other colonies, and overall the species appears to be reasonably secure provided there are no major changes in fishing practices.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This species is an endemic to sub-Saharan Africa where it is restricted to suitable waterside habitat. It never occurs far from water hence it is absent from large areas of drier countryside. In southernmost Africa it is essentially a coastal species in the south extending inland to a limited degree along a few larger and more permanent rivers. It is found from the area of St Helena Bay in the south-west round to KwaZulu-Natal from where it spreads inland becoming a freshwater species along larger tropical rivers. In Mozambique it almost disappears as a coastal species north of Delagoa Bay. Their preferred habitat is that of sandbanks, estuaries either fringed with mangroves or other macro-vegetation or with areas of dunes and associated grasses, as well as edges of pans, lakes and larger dams.</p><p>This is generally a sedentary species but local movements do occur during periods of peak flood when all suitable habitats are either under water or covered with rank vegetation. This applied particularly on the Kafue River in Zambia which has extensive floodplains that are covered in floating grasses during the flood period. Some birds retire to maintained artificial habitats on the Zambian Copperbelt but the remainder desert the river almost entirely, possibly heading south to the Zambezi. The general lack of sandbanks on this river is reflected in the low densities of dikkop found. With the widespread development of large water bodies in more arid areas one would expect these to be colonised but this has not been the case, indicating the very limited nomadism of the species. However, where larger impoundments have been created on the southern rivers there has been slight population expansion to colonise these.</p><p>This is generally a sedentary species but local movements do occur during periods of peak flood when all suitable habitats are either under water or covered with rank vegetation.

This bird, and its mate, remained on protruding rocks during the highest floods. Another ringed at the same site, probably as an immature, was resighted 25 km downstream on Lake Manyame. This was a likely example of postnatal dispersion.</p><p>Although common along suitable rivers such as the Zambezi and in the Okavango basin, the overall southern population is likely to be less than 10&#160;000 birds. Normally found in pairs or family parties they may congregate on occasions into larger groups, with the largest reported in recent years to be 33 at a flooded dune slack near Port Alfred. This exceptional count does not reflect the general status of the bird on the south coast where it has declined considerably on both estuaries and beaches over the years. This is due to extensive coastal developments, uncontrolled dogs and general disturbance.</p><p>Breeding takes place in the spring and, inland, nest scrapes with the two-egg clutch are usually sited within 20 metres of water but may be further away at coastal sites. At the Keurbooms estuary in the southern Cape one pair breeds in the middle of a Kelp Gull colony but is well hidden under a thick bush. One can only assume that when the young hatch they must stay at the nest site, being fed by the parents, otherwise they would be easily predated by the gulls which will feed at night if the opportunity arises.</p>",

A small, isolated population is found in the highland grasslands of South Africa, potentially genetically distinct from the much larger population of the species found across the floodplains and wetlands in Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo, north-east Namibia and Zimbabwe.</p><p>Standing around 175 cm tall, the Wattled Crane has a black body and ash-grey wing coverts with black primary and secondary feathers and tail coverts. It has a white upper breast and neck, with a head that is predominantly white, and a dark slaty-grey cap above the eyes and on its crown. Two white feathered wattles hang down from under the throat. The bare red skin extending from the front of the eye to the base of the beak and along the front of and to the tip of the wattles is covered in small, round wart-like bumps. The wattles can be lengthened or shortened, and the skin can be flushed and expanded or contracted, dependent on the bird’s mood. This crane has a long black bill which it uses to probe the wetland soils for plant tubers and rhizomes of submerged sedges. It also eats insects, grains, seeds, small mammals and other invertebrates. Across the floodplains, this crane is often found in close association with large plains herbivores and the wetland sedge Eliocharis.</p><p>Standing around 175 cm tall, the Wattled Crane has a black body and ash-grey wing coverts with black primary and secondary feathers and tail coverts.

In the highland grasslands of South Africa and the Driefontein grasslands of Zimbabwe, they nest predominantly in winter, and nests are sometimes surrounded by snow or ice. Under these conditions, eggs can quickly die if the cranes are disturbed and leave the nest for a prolonged period. Farther north, on tropical floodplains, they nest as the flood waters recede, making use of the water for protection in the earlier nesting phase and later on for the improved accessibility to tubers and rhizomes, and the abundance of insects for raising their chicks.</p><p>Although they lay one or two eggs, Wattled Cranes only ever raise one chick, abandoning the second egg as soon as the first chick has hatched, even if the second egg is hatching. Within a day of hatching, the chick leaves the nest with its parents and follows them across the wetland as they forage and provide it with food. The family group either returns to the nest each night to roost, or roosts on an island in an area with open water. The female spends most of her time raising the chick, while the male defends the territory and keeps a watch for predators and other threats. The family group joins a non-breeding flock once the chick can fly and is close to becoming independent. The parents remain in the flock until their offspring integrates into the flock, and then return to their territory for the next breeding season.</p><p>Wattled Cranes are monogamous and strongly defend their nesting territories from other cranes, and I have even watched them chase off other large birds and mammals, such as Spur-winged Geese and Black-backed Jackals. Although generally silent, the pair bond is strengthened by an elaborate dancing display which can be seen at any time of the year, but particularly prior to the breeding season.</p>",

The Wattled Starling is in fact the only African species which is closely related to the typical starlings of Eurasia, which it also resembles in its bill and skull shape, adapted to probing in the grass mat and opening the bill while it is inserted into the ground.</p><p>Although traditionally referred to as ‘locust birds’, locusts are only an occasional item in Wattled Starling diet, and then usually hoppers rather than adults. Many other insects, particularly those which are periodically abundant such as the Karoo ‘caterpillar’, and fruit (including grapes), make up their varied fare. They often forage on the ground, catching insects disturbed by wild ungulates or domestic stock, and occasionally perch on large mammals. Throughout their range Wattled Starlings are nomadic and often appear unpredictably. Vagrants have reached Madagascar and the Seychelles, the Arabian Peninsula and as far west as Gambia, even though there are no West African breeding records. One bird came aboard a trawler some 100 km west of the Cape coast. Non-breeding birds often form large flocks, sometimes numbering thousands of individuals. They also flock with other starlings, especially Pied Starlings and Common Starlings, and share roost sites with them or with weavers.</p><p>Although traditionally referred to as ‘locust birds’, locusts are only an occasional item in Wattled Starling diet, and then usually hoppers rather than adults.

An early publication on the loss of feathers on the head compared it to baldness in human males! Males also have black flight featherswith white wing coverts, and there is considerable variation in the pattern of the wing feathering which may reflect age as well as individual characteristics. In captivity some older females also develop wattles.</p><p>Wattled Starling songs are complex, like Common Starling songs in their wheezy tones and long phrases, and may include mimicry of other species. Close observation of aviary birds indicates that song plays an important role in courtship and pair formation. Despite its striking sexual dimorphism in appearance, the Wattled Starling is a monogamous breeder. Breeding is colonial, with up to several hundred nests built in groves of thorny trees, especially acacias. However, they occasionally breed in eucalypts and Australian acacias in the absence of thorn trees. Although breeding is seasonal in the south-western Cape, in most areas it is associated with rainfall and abundant insect food. In the Grahamstown district, there were two 19th-century reports of nesting colonies, both associated with locust swarms. Despite many resident observers, the next breeding recorded in the district was in 2010, and the nesting site was only located after flying young were spotted still being fed by the adults.</p><p>The nests are bulky, closed structures of sticks with an internal nest chamber and a side or top entrance. They are sometimes so densely packed that adjoining nest masses may become fused together. This is the only African starling in which both sexes incubate, and both feed the young. Breeding within a colony is evidently synchronised, so that birds leave together and late nests may then be abandoned. There is no information on breeding success, but at a site in the Northern Cape the arrival of Wattled Starlings excluded Southern Pied Babblers from using old starling nests, and the starlings even threw out babbler eggs from nests built within the preferred Wattled Starling nesting area.</p>",

It is a scarce non-breeding visitor to southern African waters in the Mozambique Channel, and rare farther south.

One bird has repeatedly come ashore and called at night in an old guano shed on Bird Island, Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape.

If disturbed, the bird flies off with rapid, shallow wingbeats revealing the characteristic single white band on its otherwise black tail, a feature that immediately distinguishes it from the similar-looking Southern Banded Snake Eagle.</p><p>Snakes form its main prey and, while it mostly catches these on the ground, it may swoop into a tree in pursuit of an arboreal species such as a boomslang. Lizards and frogs are also eaten, plus insects and other small items.

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Western Barn Owl is widely distributed in southern Africa, and even after splitting off Australia’s Eastern Barn Owl T. delicatula, it remains probably the most widely distributed owl in the world, found on many islands and all other continents except Antarctica. The birds occupy any habitat with abundant food, and suitable roost and nest sites. Western Barn Owls may be found roosting and nesting in deserts, grasslands, open savanna woodlands and evergreen forest edges. They frequently associate with humans in towns and farmsteads. Despite being widespread in southern Africa, however, it is strangely absent from certain areas such as parts of the southern Karoo, and this may be related to the size of available prey. Western Barn Owls take mostly a fairly narrow range of prey, made up mainly of vertebrates.</p><p>Western Barn Owls nest in a variety of sites, probably most frequently making use of man-made structures, such as holes in old buildings, disused mine shafts, prospecting pits, dry wells and under, or in cavities in concrete road bridges. They also nest in holes in trees, and in old Hamerkop nests. No actual nest is made – the eggs are laid in a shallow depression scraped in accumulated regurgitated pellets on the floor of the site. Nest sites are often used as roost sites throughout the year, and may be used repeatedly for nesting over long periods. Western Barn Owls lay large clutches of eggs, averaging about six eggs to a clutch, but there is a wide range in the number of eggs laid by any one pair. Incubation starts with the first laid egg, and because the eggs are laid 2-3 days apart, a brood of nestlings can vary greatly in age and size, from small newly hatched nestlings to larger chicks that may be two weeks old or more.</p><p>Western Barn Owls nest in a variety of sites, probably most frequently making use of man-made structures, such as holes in old buildings, disused mine shafts, prospecting pits, dry wells and under, or in cavities in concrete road bridges.

The staggered hatching also results in the older and more vociferous chicks getting fed first – at times when food is in short supply, this does ensure that at least some chicks fledge at the expense of younger and smaller siblings. But in the good times, when there is plenty of food, older and larger nestlings in large broods may help to feed younger nestlings.</p><p>Hunting methods and food are well known in Western Barn Owls. They start to forage as soon as darkness falls, hunting from a series of low perches or in silent flight. Prey is located mainly by sound, and experiments with captive birds show they can catch mice in complete darkness. Their facial disc acts as a parabolic reflector, concentrating sounds, and this, together with their asymmetrical ears that allow sounds to be accurately fixed, means that the owls can pinpoint the position of a mouse in the grass, and the owls home in on what they hear. The prey is caught by the owls using their feet, and killed with a bite to the hind neck, and usually swallowed whole. Much of the indigestible skeleton and fur is regurgitated as a pellet. A wide range of prey species have been recorded, including invertebrates such as scorpions and vertebrates such as small and larger birds, shrews, hares and mice, but most of the prey appears to be rodents 30-40 grams in mass. The skulls and other skeletal remains in pellets are usually intact, allowing the prey to be identified to species level. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Cattle Egret, widely known by the colloquial name of ‘tick-bird’, is southern Africa’s most widespread and familiar member of the heron family, and is well known to rural communities and city dwellers alike. Wherever cattle are to be found, Cattle Egrets are likely to be associated with them, and the presence of these striking white birds accompanying farm animals is an integral part of Africa’s agricultural landscape. The name ‘tick-bird’ is a misnomer, however, as the birds’ focus is not on finding and eating ticks that an animal might be carrying. Towns and cities often provide different resources used by these birds in the form of safe roosting and nesting sites, and the daily fly-past of these egrets commuting between town and country is a common sight.</p><p>What is it about Cattle Egrets that accounts for their success? Unlike virtually all other members of the heron family they have essentially forsaken the aquatic environment on which other herons are so dependent and, instead, have adapted to feeding on insects in grasslands. They share this diet with a host of other insectivorous birds, of course, but have developed a near-unique foraging technique of using grazing animals as beaters. Their long-legged, heron-like build enables them to maintain a steady walk alongside a grazing animal, more efficient than, say, a starling which constantly needs to fly forward to maintain position. Not all animals offer equal opportunities for Cattle Egrets – some (like gazelles) move too fast, others (like elephants) move too slowly, and others live in thick bush or other habitats that don’t favour the birds. Cattle and buffalo provide these birds with the ideal food flushers as they move slowly enough for the egrets to walk with them without flying.</p><p>What is it about Cattle Egrets that accounts for their success?

Cattle and buffalo provide these birds with the ideal food flushers as they move slowly enough for the egrets to walk with them without flying.</p><p>It is not unusual to see dozens of birds arriving to forage together among a herd of grazing animals. Much research has been done on the costs and benefits of their specialised feeding technique and it has been demonstrated that birds foraging on their own (which Cattle Egrets sometimes do) have a substantially lower prey strike-rate and a lower food intake than birds accompanying grazing animals. As would be expected from their foraging technique, grasshoppers feature prominently in the Cattle Egret’s diet, but crickets, butterfly larvae, beetles, flies and earthworms are taken whenever they are encountered, as are occasional frogs and lizards. Their technique is simple: the bird walks slowly and steadily forward, ahead of or alongside its chosen animal, neck and head extended well forward, the head often angled to one side. When prey is spotted it is snatched up in a quick stabbing motion, sometimes after a short chase on foot.</p><p>In southern Africa, Cattle Egrets occur abundantly across the highveld grasslands, extending southwards and westwards into the southern and Western Cape. Their westward extension into the arid Karoo and Kalahari is largely restricted to irrigation schemes, dairy farms and planted pastures as are found along the Gariep River. To the north, their range extends right across the mesic savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. Their range has expanded dramatically in the last century; they only became established in the Eastern Cape in the 1920s, in the Western Cape in the 1930s and in Zimbabwe in the 1950s. The bird was unknown in North America a century ago yet today it is widespread and abundant; this large population apparently derived from initial colonists that arrived unassisted in South America from Africa in the late 19th Century. When next this feisty little egret is dismissed as being ‘merely a Cattle Egret’, remember its roots and how far it has come in so short a time.</p>",

With a scientific name that is derived from Greek mythology its name has appeared in literature over the centuries, it has been used to brand a host of products from military aircraft and inflatable boats to backpacking gear, and it is used widely as a name for sports teams, debating teams, fishing teams and the like. The bird is also an icon to global conservation efforts. Its numbers declined sharply in the 1950s and 1960s from the build-up of harmful pesticides in the environment but rose again once DDT had been banned, and in the UK where it was virtually extinct until the 1950s, much publicised conservation efforts have brought the country’s numbers up to its current 200 nesting pairs. More recently, satellite tracking has revealed very precisely the remarkable migrations that these birds undergo biannually.</p><p>Until 2004 the Osprey was considered to be a single cosmopolitan species but recent DNA evidence has separated Australasian birds (the ‘Eastern Osprey’) from those of the rest of the world (the ‘Western Osprey’). Morphologically they are not much different; Eastern Ospreys being a little smaller than their western counterparts. For the purposes of this account the western birds, which are those occurring in southern Africa, will simply be referred to as ‘Ospreys’. The Ospreys occurring in sub-Saharan Africa are all non-breeding winter visitors from the Palaearctic, and a parallel situation occurs in the New World, where North American Ospreys migrate in winter to South America and, like their counterparts in Africa, they too are non-breeding visitors there.</p><p>Until 2004 the Osprey was considered to be a single cosmopolitan species but recent DNA evidence has separated Australasian birds (the ‘Eastern Osprey’) from those of the rest of the world (the ‘Western Osprey’).

Jutta, for example, flew over 43 000 kilometres in a little over two years in 2009-2011 while commuting between its nesting territory in Finland and its chosen winter quarters on a large dam in the Cameroons. On its way south it stopped off for a refuel at a fish farm in Poland (and survived!); it arrived in Libya close to where a battle for possession of a town was raging, and then flew across the 2 000 km desert expanse of the Sahara, taking nocturnal rests en route by settling on the dunes. Unlike most other migrating raptors that use land routes, it flew straight over the Mediterranean and covered the 1 500 kilometres in 54 hours of non-stop flying. None have been satellite-tracked to southern Africa as yet, but there are six recoveries known of birds ringed in Scandinavia that were recovered in South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p><p>Ospreys are widely but thinly reported across southern Africa, most birds spending the southern summer on one or other coastal estuary or lake. As is the case elsewhere in the world, they are entirely dependent on large water bodies and they feed almost exclusively on fish, hunting these by circling over the water or from a high perch. When prey is sighted the bird dives after it, talons outstretched, often submerging itself in the process. A small number of Ospreys remain here during the winter and it is thought that these are first-year or sub-adult birds that do not return to Europe when the adults leave. One of the vexing questions is whether Ospreys ever breed in southern Africa as several other migrants from the Palaearctic have done. Species like the European Bee-eater, Glossy Ibis and White and Black Storks are now established breeders in the region but Ospreys seem never to have gained a foothold, with only two reported occurrences of apparent breeding occurring here in the last century.</p>",

The female is brown on the crown, nape and back, with a white throat, chest and belly.

They occur widely and extensively in the woodlands of eastern and western Africa.</p><p>My experience of this species was in the brachystegia woodlands of the Marondera area where the bird was relatively common, but because of its habit of staying in the canopy, it is easily overlooked. However, when there is a flowering tree such as the Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala, numbers of Violet-backed Sunbirds will come to the flowers to feed. We had a Coffee Shade Tree Acrocarpus fraxinifolius in our garden on the farm outside Marondera and when the tree was in flower we could expect to find four or five Violet-backed Sunbirds amongst the horde of Amethyst and Scarlet-chested Sunbirds that came to feed in the tree. Violet-backed also occurred regularly in bird parties, but again needed to be searched for because they would forage silently within the canopy of the woodland, seldom coming down to a level where they were more visible.</p><p>These little sunbirds appear to be essentially insectivorous unless there is a source of abundant nectar available to them. It is interesting that because of their rather short bills they cannot successfully probe long tubular flowers on plants such as aloes, but the birds have learnt to peck a hole near the base of each flower and extract the nectar in that way. The bill is very sharp at the end and obviously goes into the flower very easily as the birds work their way up the individual flower heads of the aloes. The use of their bill in this manner played havoc with our red hot poker Kniphofia spp.flowers in the garden!</p><p>Many of the nests I was shown of this species were in farm gardens. However, I could not determine whether this was because the birds sought the relative safety of the garden or whether they were equally common and nesting in the surrounding brachystegia woodlands. The nests were sometimes built on creepers growing on the farmhouse itself. Most of the nests I saw were fairly high, usually seven to twelve metres above the ground, but occasionally we found nests which were much lower, especially one in a relatively small acacia tree growing in the middle of broad-leaved woodland. This nest was less than four metres above the ground and faced outwards from the centre of the very thorny acacia tree.</p><p>This species nests early in spring when the brachystegia trees are losing all their leaves. Practically all the nests I saw had dead leaves stuck quite loosely on the outside of the nest, making it look like an old spider’s web rather than the nest of a bird. It is interesting that the female did all the building of the nest and the incubation of the eggs, but once the eggs had hatched, the male got involved and started feeding the chicks, often at about the same rate as the female. However I never saw him actually get into the nest to brood the chicks!</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Few of the world’s birds have caused such heated debates amongst ornithologists as the ‘Yellow Wagtail’. It was traditionally considered to be a single, highly polytypic species, i.e. one species with anything between 13 and 22 subspecies. These many subspecies (or races) differ mainly in the head pattern of breeding males, and to a lesser degree in voice, claw length and size. Recognition is complicated by a large degree of interbreeding in contact zones between neighbouring subspecies, as well as individual variation and plumage aberrations.</p><p>Many researchers now believe that the previously recognised ‘Yellow Wagtail’ represents anything from two to seven, or even up to eleven, different species. Genetic data suggests a divide between a western group (including all subspecies occurring in southern Africa) and an eastern group. As such, a distinction is made here between the Western Yellow Wagtail M. flava and the Eastern Yellow Wagtail M. tschutschensis.</p><p>Many researchers now believe that the previously recognised ‘Yellow Wagtail’ represents anything from two to seven, or even up to eleven, different species.

As such, a distinction is made here between the Western Yellow Wagtail M. flava and the Eastern Yellow Wagtail M. tschutschensis.</p><p>Western Yellow Wagtails are nonbreeding migrants to Africa in the southern summer (mostly November to March in southern Africa). The breeding range spans most of Europe and western Asia (and extends east to Alaska in the Eastern Yellow Wagtail). While the various subspecies can be relatively easily distinguishable on the breeding grounds, birds in southern Africa are not easily identified as non-breeding males have much fainter head patterns, and closely resemble females and immatures. However, in the last few weeks of their stay in southern Africa, some males have completed their pre-breeding moult and their subspecies may be determinable.</p><p>At least five subspecies have been recorded in southern Africa: most common are flava (‘Blue-headed Wagtail’), lutea (‘Yellow-headed Wagtail’) and thunbergi (‘Grey-headed Wagtail’). Two less commonly encountered subspecies are feldegg (‘Black-headed Wagtail’) and beema (‘Sykes’s Wagtail’). The occurrence of flavissima (‘British Yellow Wagtail’) is unconfirmed due to the difficulty in distinguishing this subspecies from lutea.</p><p>A discussion of such complex variation is simultaneously fascinating but confusing, and should not detract from enjoying this species in the broader sense. Western Yellow Wagtails are generally uncommon but, fortunately for birders, tend to return to favoured sites each year. They frequent muddy banks, cropped grassland or ploughed fields near dams, wetlands, rivers, pans and especially sewage works. They are sometimes also found in sugar cane fields and cattle pens, and on airfields or golf courses.</p><p>They can be observed in groups of 10-20 birds throughout summer, but gather in larger numbers before migration (up to 250 in Botswana). They roost communally in trees, reeds or tall grass; up to 50&#160;000 birds have been counted using major nightly roosts elsewhere in Africa. Some birds are aggressively territorial on the non-breeding grounds, but others mix freely with their own species (irrespective of subspecies) and with other wagtails and pipits.</p><p>The Western Yellow Wagtail’s diet consists of insects, spiders, small crustaceans and occasionally small berries or seeds. They often associate with cattle and game, scrambling about beneath the animals’ hooves to snap up any displaced insects. Food is obtained by walking briskly about with the tail wagging, seizing prey after a short run or a short pursuit in flight. Bouts of frenzied, all-day eating help the birds to lay down fat as energy reserves for their northward migration, with body masses increasing by more than 30% in late summer. Birds preparing to migrate north from the Sahel are able to lay down sufficient fat reserves to allow them to cross the Sahara in one epic flight.</p><p>The call is like those of other wagtails, but usually has only one syllable, ‘pseeu’ or ‘psie’. The alarm call is a repeated ‘tshrrep’. The song - seldom heard in southern Africa – consists of slow repetitions of simple, slightly varied notes, or a faster but weak twittering.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In the early part of the 20th century this bird was considered to be less common than the Eurasian Curlew but there has been a huge change in numbers, with the Whimbrel increasing to become a common visitor to most coastal localities, while numbers of the Curlew have declined substantially. Arriving migrants begin to appear in late August, with young birds continuing into November, and adults depart during March and early April, leaving only the one- and two-year-old birds to spend the winter here. The doubling of weight prior to departure on the south coast, over the adult summer norm, indicates that they are long-hop migrants probably covering the length of Africa in a single flight. Migration is both coastal and overland, the latter indicated by the small numbers of weaker birds, usually juveniles, that drop out during their southward flight.</p><p>The breeding range is very fragmented although Holarctic. The most extensive popu&#173;lation is that of northern Europe to Asia, breeding from Iceland into Asiatic Russia, and it is from the more easterly component of these birds that our visitors are drawn. A bird ringed in Algoa Bay was recovered just south of the breeding grounds at 54°E. Birds from further west winter in West Africa although a few of these may reach further south along the west coast.</p><p>The breeding range is very fragmented although Holarctic.

Birds from further west winter in West Africa although a few of these may reach further south along the west coast.</p><p>The highest densities are found along the east and south coast of Africa across to Langebaan Lagoon, with the greatest concentration in Mozambique. This is also indicative of the more easterly provenance of our visitors. The majority of our visitors are from the nominate race (phaeopus) but small numbers of variegatus, with their much darker back and densely barred underwing and axillaries have been found down the east coast as far as Port Alfred. This is an eastern Siberian race. Another small, isolate population (alboaxillaris) from the steppe region, thought to be extinct, has recently been found to still occur in very small numbers; specimens of this race have been obtained in Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal in the past.</p><p>In non-breeding quarters the Whimbrel has very catholic habitat tastes being found in a wide variety of coastal habitats such as inter-tidal mudflats, creeks, mangroves, salt marshes, open beaches, rocky shores with tidal pools and coral reefs, while on migration shallow, muddy shorelines of large inland water bodies may also be favoured. The availability of crabs appears to be an important food feature, and in key sites such as the Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania the large numbers of fiddler crabs provide a very important food source for fattening prior to northward migration. Studies made at the Swartkops estuary, Algoa Bay, showed that mud prawns and crabs were consumed in approximately equal quantities. Birds feed singly or in loose flocks and highest intensity feeding takes place at lower tidal levels.</p>",

It can be confused with the smaller White-winged and Black Terns when in non-breeding or immature plumage, but is more heavily built with a larger head, longer bill and no dark cheek patch. Its wings are broader and its tail has a deeper fork. When sitting it appears shorter-bodied and longer-legged, clearly showing its ‘knees’. The upperparts always appear a smokier grey. It is found at suitable wetlands throughout southern Africa, albeit with a fragmented distribution. Historically, it was considered a Palaearctic migrant to the region, but it is now thought that European birds seldom venture south of the Equator. The African population forms a distinct subspecies that is darker on both the upperparts and underparts in breeding plumage.</p><p>Whiskered Terns favour freshwater, ephemeral pan systems, although the establishment of more permanent water bodies has increased their range and population size. As most pans do not fill annually, the terns are nomadic and may not breed in years of extreme drought. Successful breeding requires that appropriate water levels are maintained for long enough for the breeding cycle to be completed. As a result, breeding is opportunistic in the Eastern Cape, only taking place in years with good winter rains, but is more regular in the winter rainfall area of the Western Cape, where the winter rains are more predictable.</p><p>Whiskered Terns favour freshwater, ephemeral pan systems, although the establishment of more permanent water bodies has increased their range and population size.

Elsewhere in South Africa and Zimbabwe there is a marked reduction in numbers in winter, when many of the birds probably move north to the Kafue Flats, and other large floodplain wetlands in Zambia. By comparison, they are fairly sedentary in the Okavango and the adjacent Kalahari sandveld pans, moving to permanent waters of the swamps as peripheral pans dry up. The good rains of the last decade have seen Lake Ngami increase in size for some years now, creating a semi-permanent habitat that has attracted large numbers of birds. Breeding is now regu&#173;lar and widespread, given abundant floating weed on which they can construct their nests. In wet summers they also breed on the ephemeral pans near the Makgadigadi.</p><p>The nests are an untidy pad of plant material usually anchored to emergent or floating vegetation. They are built in shallow water. Green material is preferred and may be plucked from growing sedges and other plants. This material is added to the nest site until a pad thick enough to support the birds is created. Thereafter the birds arrange the nest material to form a shallow basin in which the eggs are laid. Some eggs are laid before the nest is thick enough to hold them, and these early eggs slip through into the water. Breeding may be solitary or colonial and the two to three young, once hatched, remain on or by the nest unless disturbed. The adults are very defensive of their eggs and young, mobbing humans and other potential predators when they approach too close to the nests.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is one of the common sunbirds of bushveld and wooded savanna in the eastern and northern parts of southern Africa. It readily enters gardens in towns and cities, especially those with nectar-bearing ornamental trees and shrubs. Like many of the sunbird family, its numbers at any locality fluctuate noticeably, ranging from zero to hundreds. This seems to happen throughout its range, often in keeping with the availability of flowering peaks of favoured nectar-rich plants. For example, it would appear from observations in the Makgadikgadi area of Botswana that this species is migratory into the Kalahari in the wet season. Once the rains start and flowering plants blossom, White-bellied Sunbirds appear and can become very common in wetter years. Once the rains stop and flowers become less conspicuous in late March and April, they disappear – presumably withdrawing to wetter areas to the east.</p><p>The White-bellied Sunbird has a distinctive and strident call, often uttered from a bush-top perch, the best likening of which can be written as ‘chewy-chewy-chewy’. When breeding, this call may act as preamble to the song, variously likened to that of a canary or of a willow warbler. Its alarm call, commonly uttered at take-off and occasionally during flight is a click-like ‘tzick’ or ‘slwick’, and it can run this note into a rattle, sounding (to some) like ‘chak-chak-chak…’.</p><p>The White-bellied Sunbird has a distinctive and strident call, often uttered from a bush-top perch, the best likening of which can be written as ‘chewy-chewy-chewy’.

Its alarm call, commonly uttered at take-off and occasionally during flight is a click-like ‘tzick’ or ‘slwick’, and it can run this note into a rattle, sounding (to some) like ‘chak-chak-chak…’.</p><p>These birds may be encountered as singletons, in pairs, or in small groups, but even when numerous may escape detection if feeding, for example, on flowers in the densely foliaged crowns of trees such as Camel Thorn Acacia erioloba or Ana Trees Faidherbia albida. The list of indigenous plants they frequent for nectar is a long one; of the alien shrubs and trees, the Australian Bottlebrush (Callistemon) is a favourite, along with Eucalypts, Jacarandas, Poinsettias, Cannas and Morning Glory. Like all sunbirds, however, they have to get their protein supplies from arthropods, so they hunt small insects (especially aphids) by gleaning leaves and twigs, or by hawking them in flight. Spiders are also high on their menu, including orb-weaving spiders, which they pluck in hovering flight from the centres of their webs. Interestingly, while in hover mode, White-bellied Sunbirds can fly backwards, a feat that New World hummingbirds can perform with ease, but which Old World sunbirds are thought incapable of, because they ‘are less accomplished hoverers’, according to a recently published statement by none other than Richard Dawkins (author of The Selfish Gene).</p><p>Apart from eating spiders, most sunbirds make extensive use of spider web in the construction of their nests. The White-bellied Sunbird goes even further on occasion, by building its nest in the chaotic and complex web of the Sociable Spider Stegodyphus domicola. These tangled webs can measure over a metre in width and height, and are customarily slung between two low shrubs or trees. They collect a lot of debris in the form of dry, wind-blown leaves, but in one such web that I came across in Zululand, a concentration of dry leaves turned out to be an occupied White-bellied Sunbird’s nest. Having stumbled across one such superbly camouflaged nest, I made a habit of checking other leaf accumulations in Sociable Spider webs, and did find another nest, albeit an old one that had likely been built by this sunbird.</p><p>These sunbirds use a variety of other sites (often very prickly ones), and sometimes also build in close proximity to the paper nests of social wasps such as Belanogaster junceus. They are parasitised occasionally by Klaas’s Cuckoos.</p>",

The nests, resembling bundles of straw stuck in thorn trees, are conspicuous from a long distance, and are often the first indication of the birds’ presence. White-browed Sparrow-Weavers are also very vocal, with bursts of loud song uttered throughout the day. They are widespread in dry savanna and thornveld from central South Africa northwards to Ethiopia. In the Eastern Cape they have expanded their range southwards, arriving in the Cradock district in the 1960s, and progressively colonising the lower sectors of the Mountain Zebra National Park. Recently there have been sightings just north of Grahamstown, more than 100 km further south.</p><p>Each group of nests is usually occupied by a single social unit, comprising a dominant male and female, together with non-breeding birds who team up to defend the territory around the nest site, and help to raise the young. The behaviour of a colour-ringed group in the campsite at Mountain Zebra National Park matched that recorded at other localities in south and east Africa. The dominant male sings from first light, initially from the entrance to his roosting nest, then from perches within the territory. This is a long, rambling song with no consistent sequence of notes, to which other territorial males reply. During the day, any strange sparrow-weaver entering the territory is challenged by the group song, a stereotyped phrase shared by all members of this breeding unit and often sung by several birds in chorus. We recorded three replacements of the dominant male, twice by unringed birds which had evidently come from another colony, and once by a previously subordinate member of the group. Studies in Zimbabwe have shown that when a new dominant male takes over, the song control areas of the brain actually increase in size as he acquires the extended vocabulary associated with the distinctive individual songs. One fight on the ground between the current dominant male and an unringed intruder lasted several minutes, with the other birds as interested spectators. The incumbent evidently won, as he was still in charge on our next visit.</p><p>Each group of nests is usually occupied by a single social unit, comprising a dominant male and female, together with non-breeding birds who team up to defend the territory around the nest site, and help to raise the young.

Initially the nest resembles a curved tunnel resting on the branch, with an opening at each end; at this stage it is used for roosting, with one bird in each nest. In the arid interior, night temperatures often fall well below freezing in winter, and the nest provides enough insulation for significant energy savings. When breeding starts, one end of a nest is closed off to form the egg chamber. The dominant female incubates alone, but once the chicks hatch, all group members collaborate to feed the chicks. It seems that the chicks do not necessarily receive more food, but the workload is spread over more birds, with the parents not bearing the brunt of it. After the chicks have fledged, they will beg and be fed by group members for at least a week. The birds eat a lot of insects, especially harvester termites, though they also take seeds. Most of their food is collected on the ground.</p><p>Sparrow-weavers do not seem to disperse far, usually less than 10 km. Adult survival rates are high and there are several records of birds more than 10 years old. Group living generally offers better security from predators. The disadvantage is competition for food, rank, and breeding vacancies with other group members.</p>",

They fly with an almost floating action, appearing to be very ‘light’ as they fly along.</p><p>These are birds of the broad-leaved woodlands and are particularly common in the miombo type woodlands of central Africa. During the non-breeding season, groups may well move into urban areas and into acacia woodlands where they do not normally breed. The birds move through their woodland habitat as a group, keeping in contact the whole time with a fairly quiet ‘whit-whit’. They land in a tree quite close to the ground then sit still, observing the ground below for prey. At times the whole group will suddenly break into a loud ringing call ‘krawow-krawow-kreee-kreee-kreep-krow-kreep-krow’. They also use bill clicking quite regularly as a means of communication within the group.</p><p>The birds feed on caterpillars and insects which may be obtained by foraging in the canopy or along branches. However, prey is often caught by the bird dropping from a perch onto the ground below. In my study area at Gosho Park, Marondera, Zimbabwe, the resident parties of White-crested Helmet-Shrikes would sometimes join the mixed bird parties moving through the woodland. However, they did not usually stay with the bird party for very long.</p><p>This bird builds one of the most beautiful nests in the woodlands. It is cup-shaped and built either in a fork or on a fairly large horizontal branch. It is made of fine rootlets or similar material woven into a cup by the bird sitting in the nest and moving round and round to make the nest an almost perfect circle. The nest is finished off by covering the whole nest with white spider’s web which matches the grey lichen on the branches so well that the nest is almost invisible.</p><p>The birds usually lay three eggs. When the chicks reach about two thirds their adult size they start to overflow the nest and gradually flatten the rim so that the space in the nest becomes bigger. However, we noticed that quite often the weakest chick would end up being kicked out of the nest altogether. All the birds in the flock feed the chicks and the flock bearing food would all arrive at the same time and land on a branch near the nest. Each bird would take its turn to feed the chicks and then would move off into a nearby tree to await the end of the feeding session. The last bird to feed would brood the chicks while they were small otherwise would stay somewhere nearby, rather like a sentry, while the rest of the flock moved off to forage for further food. Carl Vernon was able to show that the groups always had a dominant or alpha pair which did the breeding and the others all assisted with the feeding. The chicks stayed in the group after fledging but if the group was a large one, many would leave the group before the start of the following breeding season to join other groups, or perhaps start a new group if there was available territory.</p>",

On the Zambezi River, upstream of Victoria Falls and into Caprivi, this is a common bird, even though its range extends only a short distance up a very few of the tributaries (except for the Luangwa River in Zambia). Essentially sedentary, White-crowned Lapwings move very short distances during times of flooding, and usually only away from the river to nearby patches of bare ground or woodland pans. Some birds do wander in small parties along the river, but these are mostly subadults moving until old enough to fill a breeding vacancy. An indication of this sort of movement is provided by one of a group of birds colour-ringed on Lake Kariba and seen 30 km east a couple of months later. These birds do not breed before two to three years of age, possibly older when breeding opportunities are scarce. It is not known what effect the vegetating of many sandbanks along the Zambezi River has had on overall population numbers and breeding success, but it is likely to be negative.</p><p>To the south of the Zambezi River, this species is found along the Limpopo and Save River systems. To the north it occurs on the Luangwa River and along a very few suitable rivers in Tanzania. There is a separate population whose range extends from northern Angola and the DRC through tropical West Africa to the west African coast. In southern Africa, the species is generally uncommon, except on the middle Zambezi, and numbers have decreased along several rivers due to falling water levels, forestry and alien plant invasions, especially in South Africa, Mozambique and the south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe. The southern African population is thought to number between 20&#160;000 and 50&#160;000 birds, but is probably in the lower part of this range.</p><p>To the south of the Zambezi River, this species is found along the Limpopo and Save River systems.

These are presumably used in display.</p><p>The breeding biology of this species is not well known, mainly because they tend to breed at the hottest time of year and establish their nest sites far out on exposed sandbanks away from the river’s edge. Without a hide they are very difficult to watch closely because of their shyness at this time. This shyness presumably stems from the risks they have to face when breeding, not the least of which are herds of cattle or game, Hippopotamus, elephant, a variety of ground and aerial predators and crocodiles sunning themselves or excavating burrows for their eggs. White-crowned Lapwing pairs nest solitarily and defend their nests vigorously, especially against other waders. The nest, which is nothing more than a scrape in the sand, may be shallow or quite deep. The clutch comprises three or four eggs. In the extreme heat, the birds regularly wet their belly feathers to keep the eggs cool and, during the heat of the day, stand over the eggs rather than incubate them.</p>",

It is found in places all along the African coast from Senegal to Somaliland, but is replaced to the north by its close relative, the Kentish Plover. These two species, together with several other small plovers from around the world, form a distinct grouping, or superspecies, which are very closely related and whose taxonomy has still not been fully explored.</p><p>Taxonomists divide African White-fronted Plover populations into three races, one inhabiting the west and southern coastline (marginatus), another the south-eastern and eastern coasts (arenaceus), and the third, an inland form (mechowi), occurring mainly on lowveld sand rivers. This inland bird is smaller than birds of the other two races, appearing close in size to a Little Stint. When seen next to its coastal relatives, adults appear darker, more brownish on the upperparts and richer buff on the breast, and immature birds have brown side chest bands.</p><p>Taxonomists divide African White-fronted Plover populations into three races, one inhabiting the west and southern coastline (marginatus), another the south-eastern and eastern coasts (arenaceus), and the third, an inland form (mechowi), occurring mainly on lowveld sand rivers.

When seen next to its coastal relatives, adults appear darker, more brownish on the upperparts and richer buff on the breast, and immature birds have brown side chest bands.</p><p>While the coastal forms are relatively sedentary, this inland form is forced to move during the season of peak flooding when its sandbank habitat is submerged. At such times the majority move to the coast, with a few remaining where suitable habitat persists in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe during drought years. The birds of the Limpopo, Save and Zambezi river systems move to the east coast during the summer months, some even reaching as far south as St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape. It is not clear what happens to those of the Okavango and Kunene systems but they probably follow the other birds to the east coast although a few may be found scattered over Namibia.</p><p>The entire southern population of White- fronted Plovers probably totals 20&#160;000 to 25&#160;000 birds; it has suffered declines along the coast where beach habi&#173;tat has been degraded by human recreational activities, and inland where dam building has flooded riverine habitat. The highest densities of this plover are to be found on the central Namibian coast from Sandwich Harbour to Swakopmund.</p><p>Nesting commonly takes place at the top of a beach, usually well above normal high flood level, but not always beyond the reach of equinoctial spring tides. Where dune systems are more extensive, as in the Alexandria dune field, they may breed quite far inland and, after hatching, walk their downy chicks to closer proximity of the sea. They feed in the inter-tidal zone, more often at night to avoid the attentions of marauding gulls, while the parents maintain a close vigil. The nest is situated in a scrape in the sand, usually close to an object such as a rock, or piece of driftwood, or a dune plant. Unlike Kittlitz’s Plover, this species does not always cover the eggs with sand when leaving the nest to feed, but may do so at the approach of danger. Temporary desertion of the nest is necessary as the birds feed with the tides, and if low tide occurs during the day they must make full use of this foraging period. The adults are often multi-brooded during the season, and where eggs are lost regularly (due, for example, to summer holiday crowds disrupting nesting activities at the height of their breeding season) they may lay several repeat clutches, especially along the food-rich beaches of the Western Cape.</p>",

What is a characteristic of this little bird is the way in which it constantly fans its tail as it hops around in the trees looking for food. The object of this behaviour is to flush insects into flight whereupon the prey is immediately pursued and snapped up. Australia has a common bird which is also a tail-fanning flycatcher though the Australians call it a ‘Willie Wagtail’. Although this also fans its tail it does so to one side or the other and does so while it is on the ground.</p><p>The White-tailed Crested Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the undergrowth shrubs and lower levels of the inside of evergreen highland forests. It occurs on montane islands from Mt Elgon on the Kenya/Uganda border down to the Chirinda forest on the border of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Further north there are two more very similar dark blue forest flycatchers. In Zambia and further north there are also two closely related but sky-blue species of more open big-tree woodlands. These quickly occupy areas around human habitation, and the African Blue Flycatcher must rank amongst Africa’s top ten prettiest birds.</p><p>The White-tailed Crested Flycatcher is essentially a bird of the undergrowth shrubs and lower levels of the inside of evergreen highland forests.

They are so active that it takes no time to pick them out by their constant movement. They are sociable, going around in pairs or small families and are regular members of the forest bird parties. They flit here and there, then swoop down, round and up again or up and over and then hop along a branch zigzagging as they go because they change the direction they face with each hop. They are not sit-and-wait flycatchers.</p><p>Their nests are works of art: little wine glasses perfectly symmetrical and proportionate, complete with attenuated bottom to catch the dregs. The final shape is determined by the shape of the fork in which the birds choose to build the nest. Some are very long and thin at the bottom, others are shorter and wider because the fork opens out more quickly. They are placed anywhere from 0.3 to 3.0 metres off the ground and are neatly plastered outside with cool green moss. Like many other forest birds they often build their nests within a metre of a well-used footpath.</p><p>Somebody needs to do a serious study of the distribution of nests within forests and woodlands. Perhaps people constantly using a path are a lesser threat than monkeys that are deterred by frequent human presence. One can walk up and down a path half a dozen times before realising that there is a robin’s nest in the bank right next to you or that that clump of dead leaves is a thrush’s nest. Perhaps the clear path gives a quick and safe getaway. But find one nest, whether you are along a path or not, and you have a good chance of finding another and even another nearby; not the same species but different kinds of birds. Work twenty hectares of forest – or woodland for that matter – and you may find sixty nests. But are they evenly distributed or in clusters? Does the safety-in-numbers factor which contributes to the attraction of joining a bird party extend to setting up nests where you have plenty of neighbours around you?</p>",

The core of its distribution is in the semi-arid Great Karoo but its range extends down to the temperate south coast and also through Namibia to southern Angola. It tolerates arid environments such as the Kgalagadi and the Richtersveld, provided that there is water available. It is not unusual to see flocks, sometimes of several hundred, at water points in these dry regions. Farming activity, with the associated dams and windmills, must certainly have been to the benefit of these canaries, and indeed of all seedeaters. Where water sources have dried up, White-throated Canaries are forced to move in a nomadic manner, but there is no evidence of regu&#173;lar local migration.</p><p>In the south-western Cape, especially on the coastal plains, much of this species’ former habitat has been adversely affected by the encroachment of alien vegetation, mostly Australian acacias. It does tolerate these degraded habitats, provided some indigenous veld is also present. For example, it still occurs in the bush along the Western Cape’s False Bay coast in the Somerset West district but the population there is small and decreasing, due largely to encroachment of alien vegetation and fragmentation of native shrubland. Despite these local decreases, however, overall the species remains widespread and common.</p><p>In the south-western Cape, especially on the coastal plains, much of this species’ former habitat has been adversely affected by the encroachment of alien vegetation, mostly Australian acacias.

Despite these local decreases, however, overall the species remains widespread and common.</p><p>It is a rather drab and unremarkable bird, with a sparrow-like contact call that is often the first indication of its presence. The yellow rump (not always readily visible) and heavy bill should prevent confusion with any other species with the possible exception of the Protea Seedeater with which it occasionally overlaps on the fringes of the Karoo.</p><p>The White-throated Canary is not strongly territorial, and nests can be placed as close as 40 m apart. This is not unusual for a canary – both Streaky-headed Seedeaters and Cape Canaries often nest in close proximity with conspecifics, with little sign of territorial aggression. The nest is usually placed in a bush, less often in a tree, seldom higher than 2.5 m above the ground. They tend to be more loosely built than, for example, the nests of the Streaky-headed Seedeater and Brimstone Canary. Typically, nests are lined with plant down and, where available, wool. In the winter rainfall area, where rainfall is predictable and dependable, the main breeding season is from August to November. Over much of its range, however, it is an opportunistic breeder, with nesting being triggered by rainfall. In the Karoo National Park near Beaufort West breeding was in full swing in March and April in a year when torrential rain had fallen, following an intense drought.</p><p>White-throated Canaries are not only opportunistic breeders, they are also opportunistic feeders. After a heavy summer shower in the MontEco Nature Reserve near Montagu, a group was watched flying up from a perch and catching emerging termite alates. This behaviour is certainly not part of the species’ normal foraging routine but is a good example of just how adaptable these birds can be.</p>",

During the day they are found in groups ranging from small to fairly large, but at night they congregate into large roosting flocks. These birds may travel a considerable distance to find suitable night-time roost sites, where they prefer to roost on damp sand or mud in ankle-deep water. Birds have been watched flighting in from on high from the north and north-west in the evening at Walvis Bay in February and March to join the mixed-tern roost. These birds would have to travel quite a distance across the Namib Desert from feeding areas inland to reach this site. It is not known why these birds should make this daily movement at this time of year, but perhaps they are migrants arriving at the roost.</p><p>During the day flocks move around quite rapidly, appearing suddenly at a feeding station and just as suddenly disappearing again in search of other suitable feeding grounds. They may be found alongside Whiskered Terns, both feeding mainly on insects, but at Lake Kariba they have taken to feeding around the kapenta (a small, sardine-like fish) boats at night, snapping up any injured or dead fish that float to the surface. At coastal sites they spend more time catching shoreline insects than they do feeding from the sea.</p><p>Identification of marsh terns in non-breeding plumage can sometimes cause problems as they are superficially similar. The White-winged Tern is the whitest and palest of the three species, lacks the dark shoulder patches of the Black Tern, and has a very pale rump and tail. The Whiskered Tern is a more heavily built bird, with a broader head when seen head-on, and overall has a much duskier grey appearance. In breeding plumage each species is quite distinct but the White-winged Tern stands out as one of the most beautiful of all terns with its very distinctive, contrasting black, grey and white plumage with black back and contrasting white rump and striking black underwing coverts. When it opens its bill to catch food or call, the distinctive bright coral-red mouth parts stand out. The legs are also bright coral-red, adding to the colour scheme.</p>",

She is then left to incubate the eggs and raise the chicks without any help from the male. Based on a study in Zimbabwe, it seems that often more than half the nests are destroyed by predators, and some are parasitised by the Dideric Cuckoo. Nevertheless, the birds are common, and adults probably have a high survival rate; the oldest bird recorded so far in the field was more than seven years old. Undamaged nests of the White-winged Widow are often used by Orange-breasted Waxbills late in the breeding season – a lining of feathers is a good indication that a waxbill has moved in.</p>",

They are comparatively rare in most areas but may be locally common. They seem to prefer pans and dams which have water lilies, which can be explained by the fact that the seeds of the water lilies are one of the major items of their diet. In the Marondera area I noticed that this species would be resident in some farm dams but not in others, despite the dams looking very similar to me, with water lilies in both. When pans or dams dry out the birds are forced to move to other areas, and this nomadic behaviour is typical of all of our ducks because of the seasonal variations in water levels.</p><p>The White-backed Duck is a ‘bottom feeder’. They dive and obtain food from the bottom of a dam or pan where seeds from emergent vegetation such as water lilies and water grass will collect. Feeding is normally in the two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset, although I have watched them feeding extensively in the middle of the day on overcast days. Between bouts of feeding they tend to rest afloat among the lily pads with which they blend very well; well enough to escape detection by observers who fail to scan every area of floating vegetation.</p><p>This species builds a large nest of aquatic vegetation such as sedge and rushes in emergent vegetation which is bent over to create a platform; the nest is well concealed by the vegetation above it. The nests that I saw were all at least 100-150&#160;mm thick, and in one case when the water level rose following rain, the nest actually floated up with the water.  This species will often lay 6-8 eggs which are comparatively large and heavy, and if laid by a single female, the total weight of the clutch is more than the weight of the bird!  They are apparently one of the most difficult of ducks to rear in captivity but if a pair which breeds regularly is obtained, they will breed at least three times a year if sufficient food is fed to them. Although breeding is obviously determined by water levels and rain in the wild, it was conspicuous that this species bred throughout the year on the farm dams where water levels stabilised during the summer and remained relatively stable throughout the winter to the following rainy season.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The White-backed Mousebird is endemic to southern Africa, reaching the northern limit of its range on the Kunene River in northern Namibia, with unsubstantiated sightings from southern Angola. Its call is one of the characteristic sounds of the dry western parts of southern Africa. It is the mousebird most likely to be encountered in the driest of habitats, following corridors of Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo that line the rivers of the Great Karoo, and the dense riverine thickets along the Gariep River. White-backed Mousebirds even venture into sparsely wooded drainage lines on the fringes of the Namib Desert. But the species is by no means confined to parched and desolate landscapes. In the southern coastal belt of the Western Cape it is a regular visitor to the relatively lush riparian growth along rivers such as the Breede, although in these habitats it is typically outnumbered by Speckled Mousebirds.</p><p>In the 1960s, White-backed Mousebirds colonised areas around Johannesburg but it seems as if they are now being displaced from there by Speckled Mousebirds. By contrast, in the Western Cape town of Somerset West, the Speckled Mousebird was the dominant mousebird 40 years ago, but it has gradually decreased in numbers and now the White-backed Mousebird dominates the gardens.</p><p>In the 1960s, White-backed Mousebirds colonised areas around Johannesburg but it seems as if they are now being displaced from there by Speckled Mousebirds. By contrast, in the Western Cape town of Somerset West, the Speckled Mousebird was the dominant mousebird 40 years ago, but it has gradually decreased in numbers and now the White-backed Mousebird dominates the gardens.</p><p>Mousebirds are great sun lovers and, particularly on cold days, they perch prominently and orientate their underparts to the sun, sometimes raising the hair-like feathers on their bellies to maximise exposure. On a cold morning in winter they may perch like this for an hour or more before moving off to start foraging. At night they choose a dense bush for roosting, and as many as 12 birds cluster tightly together to minimise heat loss.</p><p>Dust-bathing is a regular mousebird activity, presumably to keep their feathers dry and parasite free. After dust-bathing they vigorously ruffle their feathers to disperse any residue of sand or dust. The cup-shaped bath is often reused over a period of a few days.</p><p>Although mousebirds are restless and seem to be always on the move, there is no evidence of long-distance dispersal (all ring recoveries are within 65 km of the ringing site). They are largely fruit and flower eaters which necessitates their constant searching for seasonal food sources. The honey-thorns Lycium spp., which grow over large parts of the Karoo, are a great attraction and both the fruit and the flowers are eaten, and possibly the leaves too. Alien trees such as Syringa Melia azedarach, often planted around homesteads, are also a seasonal source of food and are a favourite with mousebirds. They are also strongly attracted to fruit orchards and, much to the despair of farmers, inflict considerable damage to ripening crops. A fruit farmer on the banks of the Gouritz River near Albertinia claims to have shot “hundreds” during a season with little to show for his efforts.</p><p>Both Speckled and Red-faced Mousebirds construct nests up to 6 metres above the ground but White-backed Mousebirds tend to build their nests in a thick, low bush, seldom higher than 2.5 metres, although there are exceptions to this. The nest, built by both sexes and sometimes with one or two helpers, is the shape of a large open saucer and is often untidy. In sheep-producing areas, wool is a common component of the lining, which often includes soft seeds and plant down. Nests are sometimes built on top of old nests of other species, including Common Fiscal and Cape Sparrow. &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Secretive would be the defining word for this crepuscular/nocturnal bird, a species that can live right alongside people without its presence ever being detected. It is one of two night herons found in southern Africa and, despite similarities between the two in build, diet, nocturnal habits and sexual monomorphism, the two species don’t have much else in common. One is near-cosmopolitan in its range and occurs on a wide cross-section of wetland types; the other, the White-backed Night Heron, is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and is largely restricted to well-wooded, slow-flowing rivers. Published maps show its distribution as consisting of scattered unconnected dots, most of these spread across the more northern savanna areas, with a few extending south and west along the eastern coastline into the Eastern Cape. Its stronghold in the region probably lies in the panhandle region of the Okavango Delta and it is certainly here where the bird is most easily seen, usually from after-dark boat rides up and down the Okavango River.</p><p>Seen after dark, either fishing from a rock, wading in a shallow pool, or perched on a low branch, the White-backed Night Heron looks much like any other heron, with rather long legs and neck, a dagger-like bill and an upright stance. Most notable are its exceptionally large, dark eyes and these are ringed by white, giving the bird a masked appearance. The bird’s diet consists chiefly of fish, secured mainly by still-hunting from a rock or stump or by slowly wading through shallow water. By day these herons take on another identity, hiding themselves skillfully within the foliage of leafy trees or shrubs overhanging water. They often remain still when approached and, if disturbed, are reluctant to fly but rather creep away in the branches to another position where they remain hunched and watchful. If they take to flight it is only to disappear into another well-foliaged position further along the river.</p><p>Seen after dark, either fishing from a rock, wading in a shallow pool, or perched on a low branch, the White-backed Night Heron looks much like any other heron, with rather long legs and neck, a dagger-like bill and an upright stance.

If they take to flight it is only to disappear into another well-foliaged position further along the river.</p><p>There are no reports of White-backed Night Herons ever breeding other than solitarily, nor do they roost communally.  The likelihood is that pairs live together year-round in territories along suitable rivers, often sharing such rivers with that other most secretive of river birds, the African Finfoot. Nesting takes place mainly in early to midsummer in most of its range but later (March to May) in the Okavango, the timing here coinciding with rising floodwaters. A substantial platform nest is built of twigs, and it is typically placed on a well-foliaged branch overhanging water and within a metre or two of it. Nesting sites are sometimes reused in successive years; this is another indicator of the sedentary nature of established birds. On large, braided rivers, nests are sometimes built among rocks on islands or in clumps of reeds, and occasionally they are in trees on islands away from water.</p><p>The usual clutch size is 2-3 eggs and the incubation, which is shared by the parents, commences before laying is completed. The eggs hatch after 23-26 days, and about three weeks after hatching, the chicks leave the nest and move into the branches if disturbed. Both sexes feed and brood the young, which first fly when they are about six weeks old. Pairs may re-lay if they lose a clutch, and in one recorded nest a pair re-laid a few months after fledging their first brood. These birds are ranked as Vulnerable in South Africa but this may be an artefact of their going undetected in many places where they actually do occur.</p>",

The white back of the adult is only visible in flight or when the birds are sunbathing with their wings spread out.</p><p>The White-backed Vulture has a dark head covered with light-coloured down. The rest of the body is brown to dark brown but variable in shade, while the juvenile is flecked with lighter colour. The white back of the adult is only visible in flight or when the birds are sunbathing with their wings spread out.</p><p>The birds have to wait for the sun to warm the land and create thermals before they take off. They fly at some considerable height above the ground looking for food, usually large animal carcasses. The birds keep one another in sight so that should one bird spot a carcass and spiral down, the others will rapidly follow, and within a very short space of time fifty or a hundred birds will have gathered at a carcass. This means that there is considerable competition for food, and the feeding mêlée has been described as being tantamount to a loose rugby scrum!  In these feeding masses White-backs dominate smaller vultures, but they, in turn, are dominated by Cape and Lappet-faced Vultures. If there is sufficient meat, a White-backed will gather up to one kilogram of meat in two to five minutes, to fill its crop.</p><p>In eastern Zimbabwe it is interesting that the White-backed Vulture only nests in the Save Valley lowveld. The plateau or highveld hosts juvenile and immature vultures during their first three years after fledging, and then they are able to return as adults to the lowveld to join the breeding birds. Because many of the open grassland areas around Marondera were planted to crops, the juvenile White-backed Vultures often had difficulty finding sufficient food. When vulture restaurants were established at places like Marondera and Featherstone abattoirs, the birds gathered to feed there, and it appeared that these young birds’ survival rate improved. They would gather in the trees around the ‘restaurant’ where the meat was put out, and would check very carefully under the trees for any danger. However, once one or two birds dropped down onto the meat to feed, the rest would follow almost immediately, flying down to pile in and grab as much meat as they could before it was finished.</p><p>White-backed Vultures always nest in trees and because the birds would have difficulty getting inside the trees, they build their nest right on the top of a large tree. It is noticeable that where the trees are large enough – in Baobabs for example – one gets two or even three pairs of birds nesting in the same tree. Elsewhere the birds nest in the taller riverine forests, and there are nests on the top of just about every tall tree along parts of the river. The birds start laying at the end of summer, with most eggs being laid in May, June or July. Incubation takes from 55 to 60 days, so the chicks are in the nest through late winter and spring, when presumably food would be more abundant.  The nestling period is approximately four months but the young birds are still fed by the adults for at least five or six months, and are still around when the next breeding season commences. It is interesting that the feeding of juveniles usually takes place on the nest, not at carcasses.</p>",

Five subspecies are recognised and two of these occur in southern Africa.</p><p>The highly isolated race E. s. barrowii is essentially endemic to South Africa, although it also occurs marginally in south-eastern Botswana and south-western Swaziland. This South African population is split into two main subpopulations. The major one lies north of Lesotho and the other south of that country in the Eastern Cape as far south as Humansdorp. The southern population appears highly fragmented and is of particular conservation concern. There are also small isolated populations at the northernmost reach of the range, on the Polo&#173;kwane (formerly Pietersburg) and Waterberg plateaus. The main stronghold of barrowii is likely just east of the Great Escarpment, especially in the tall grasslands of north-western KwaZulu-Natal. The birds are particularly thick on the ground around the town of Ladysmith that nestles below Van Reenen’s Pass.</p><p>The highly isolated race E. s. barrowii is essentially endemic to South Africa, although it also occurs marginally in south-eastern Botswana and south-western Swaziland.

The birds are particularly thick on the ground around the town of Ladysmith that nestles below Van Reenen’s Pass.</p><p>Turning to the second subspecies, in a situation somewhat analogous to that found in Denham’s Bustard, the central African race E. s. mackenziei has been recorded on several occasions as a presumably very rare vagrant to the far northern extremity of Namibia but the regularity of its occurrence in this area is unknown. This race differs from barrowii in possessing a more extensive blue-grey crown, more intensively marked upperparts and in lacking the indistinct blue-grey patch below the eye present in the latter. It also has markedly longer legs than barrowii.</p><p>Male White-bellied Bustards are somewhat similar to the Blue Bustard in appearance, with their blue-grey forenecks and breasts. The females are more distinct from one another, and female White-bellied Bustards are indeed more likely to be confused with the female Black-bellied Bustard, which, anomalously, has white underparts. The White-bellied and Blue bustards also share similar vocalisations and behaviour. The call in White-bellied Bustards is higher pitched though, a more strident ‘takwar-takwarat’. White-bellied Bustards are also largely sedentary and group-territorial but tend to evidence smaller group sizes of 2-3 compared with the Blue Bustard. They prefer drier, taller and ranker grasslands, usually at lower altitudes than the Blue Bustard and are more tolerant of lightly wooded areas. The breeding habits of the species are particularly poorly known but again are likely similar to those of the Blue Bustard.</p><p>The diet of the White-bellied Bustard mirrors the catholic selection favoured by most bustards and includes invertebrates such as beetles, locusts, caterpillars, termites, ants, spiders, scorpions and snails; small vertebrates such as lizards, and vegetable matter in the form of seeds, bulbs, berries and flowers. One stomach contained three quarters vegetable matter and the balance invertebrates.</p><p>It has been mooted that barrowii should be recognised as a separate species (‘Barrow’s Bustard’) from the forms of White-bellied Bustard found further north in Africa but more detailed studies, particularly genetic investigations, are required to confirm any need to modify the status quo. Also, barrowii and mackenziei, which both show extensive rufous on the hindneck, may be each other’s closest relatives, suggesting that any ‘splits’ in this complex might still require retaining these two races as conspecific.</p><p>What is without doubt is that barrowii, like many of the large grassland specialist birds in southern Africa, is being recognised, perhaps rather belatedly, as of conservation concern. The key threats stem from ploughing, overgrazing, commercial afforestation, open-cast mining, dense human settlement, and too frequent and poorly timed burning, which eliminates, fragments or degrades its fragile grassland haunts. There are also records of this bird flying into overhead transmission lines. Confirmed natural predators include Verreaux’s Eagle.</p>",

The two species pose an identification challenge that we are just starting to understand. In the Agulhas Retroflection south and east of South Africa, extremely pale-backed birds come from the Australasian population (or perhaps Amsterdam and St Paul Islands), but birds seen off the west coast probably come from Tristan da Cunha or Gough Island, where both White-bellied Storm Petrels and a white-bellied form of the Black-bellied Storm Petrel breed. These two species can only be told apart with an extremely good view. Key features include the length of the legs (shorter in White-bellied Storm Petrel, with toes rarely extending far beyond the tail tip), width of the white rump (narrower in most White-bellied Storm Petrels) and extent of black on the underparts (less in White-bellied Storm Petrels). Whether one or both of these populations from Tristan and Gough reaches southern African waters remains to be resolved. Both species have become rare on Gough Island, presumably due to predation by introduced House Mice, but are not globally threatened.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The White-breasted Cormorant is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Eurasian Great Cormorant P. carbo, with which it intergrades locally in Morocco. It is the largest cormorant in southern Africa, and is readily identified by the combination of its large size and whitish underparts (confined to the breast in adults, but extending onto the belly in immature birds). The white breast of some adults is suffused pinkish-buff, especially at the coast. They have a short crest at the back of the head, which can be raised when excited or alarmed. At the start of the breeding season, the adults’ dull yellow facial skin turns orange-scarlet and they have white filoplumes on the head and upper neck.</p><p>White-breasted Cormorants feed in a variety of fresh-water, estuarine and shallow marine habitats, with coastal birds often moving between these habitats. Adults commute up to 20 kilometres between foraging and roost sites, and may move away from their breeding colonies entirely outside the breeding season. They are strong fliers, and can travel considerable distances. Juveniles ringed at Barberspan in the North West Province have been recovered from the Western Cape, Orange River Mouth and on the Zambezi River in Zimbabwe.</p><p>White-breasted Cormorants feed in a variety of fresh-water, estuarine and shallow marine habitats, with coastal birds often moving between these habitats.

Juveniles ringed at Barberspan in the North West Province have been recovered from the Western Cape, Orange River Mouth and on the Zambezi River in Zimbabwe.</p><p>They typically forage on the bottom of lakes and the sea, remaining in shallow water fairly close to the shore. Dive durations increase with water depth, but bottom time remains fairly constant at about 20 seconds, with the maximum recorded dive lasting 84 seconds. They tend to forage over sandy or muddy bottoms, and move rapidly underwater, attaining bottom speeds of around 4 metres per second, generally faster than other cormorants in the region. Their diet is dominated by fish, although they also take frogs and crabs occasionally. They tend to eat whatever fish are present in a wetland, exhibiting little evidence of selectivity. Most prey is small, seldom weighing more than 50 grams, but they sometimes eat fish close to 400 grams. This can prove to be lethal, as they occasionally choke to death on very large fish. They can also be opportunistic foragers, stealing fish from other birds, and sometimes feed on land, eating Cape Cormorant chicks at colonies in Namibia.</p><p>Like other cormorants they fish in short bouts, returning to land to warm up and digest their catch. Foraging bouts typically are shorter in fresh water (average 15 minutes) than in the sea (49 minutes), and the intervals between foraging bouts scale accordingly, being more than twice as long for birds foraging in the sea. They are efficient foragers, and typically spend only about 20% of the day feeding. Most foraging occurs singly, but they may forage in groups to help herd fish or when feeding on schooling fish. They may also accompany other fish-eating birds, including Great White Pelicans.</p><p>Breeding is colonial, with pairs building stick nests in a variety of sites inaccessible to predators, including in trees, cliff ledges, on the ground on islands, and man-made sites such as wrecked ships, pylons and guano platforms. At wetlands they are often found in mixed colonies with Reed Cormorants, darters, egrets, herons and ibises. Like all cormorants, incubation commences once the first egg is laid, so hatching is staggered. This creates a strong size hierarchy in the brood, and the smallest chicks usually starve unless food is particularly plentiful. In hot weather, adults regurgitate water onto the chicks to keep them cool.</p><p>White-breasted Cormorants are not threatened, but their breeding colonies are susceptible to disturbance, and numbers have decreased at several offshore islands in the Western Cape over the last few decades.</p>",

It also moves out into the leafy part of the tree but because it is too heavy, it cannot get right to the end of the branches like the Yellow White-eyes. It certainly eats caterpillars, even the hairy ones, and also other insects which it finds in the lichen or on the leaves.</p><p>White-breasted Cuckooshrikes build a cup-shaped nest in a horizontal fork of a tree branch; it is covered very carefully with lichen to make it blend with the branch on which it is built. The grey back of this species blends well with the grey lichen that covers the branches and, viewed from above, the bird is almost invisible when sitting on the nest. This was borne out while photographing the bird; when a Pied Crow landed in a nearby tree the cuckooshrike did not move and the crow flew away without seeing the cuckooshrike.</p><p>It was interesting to note that the birds seldom flew directly to the nest; instead they would land somewhere nearby in the same tree and look around carefully for danger, before actually going to the nest.   One of the strange features of this cuckooshrike is its long incubation and nestling periods compared with those of other birds of the same size in the same woodlands. The birds lay two greenish-coloured eggs which are well marked with rusty-coloured spots. Incubation can be as much as 28 days, which is much more than the 14-16 days normally required by similar-sized birds. When the chicks hatch they are a whitish colour, which matches the lichen on the branches of the trees; seen from above the chicks look just like bits of lichen. When photographing the chicks we noticed that when a predator flew over, they flattened themselves in the nest and effectively disappeared from sight because they matched the branches so well! The chicks that we were watching spent nearly four weeks in the nest and by the time they fledged they were replicas of the adult. Apparently the young spend the next two or three months with the parents and are fed throughout this period. Even so, studies done by Carl Vernon showed that the pairs of White-breasted Cuckooshrikes in his study area only managed, on average, to rear one chick per pair per year.</p>",

However, caution is needed to separate it from immature Burchell’s Coucals, which also show a white supercilium. Originally considered to be a subspecies of the Burchell’s Coucal, it is now separated as a full species which replaces Burchell’s Coucal north of the Limpopo River and across to northern Botswana. It is absent from large parts of the Zimbabwe Plateau where the Senegal Coucal holds sway. White-browed Coucals have the typical coucal shape, and apart from the streaked head, the wings, rump and tail are very similar to those of Burchell’s Coucals.</p><p>The White-browed Coucal is a bird of the lower-lying parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique and is particularly common along the Zambezi River in northern Zimbabwe. Around Kariba it is conspicuous, not just because of its loud bubbling call, but also because it so often sits on a conspicuous perch. It is a common garden bird in Kariba town where I often saw it feeding out in the open on the lawn. It seems to be common and remarkably tolerant of people in many rural villages, allowing one to approach quite closely. However, if one gets too close, the bird abruptly drops down and disappears into the bush on which it was sitting.</p><p>The White-browed Coucal is a bird of the lower-lying parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique and is particularly common along the Zambezi River in northern Zimbabwe.

Like the other coucals, they are omnivorous, eating small reptiles, birds’ eggs and chicks as well as mice, and even crabs when they live near water. When they feed on the ground, they prefer to operate under cover of a bush and seldom venture into the open for long. They often walk or run from one patch of bush to another rather than flying because their flight is comparatively weak.</p><p>They appear to maintain their territories throughout the year; certainly they are well known in a variety of places around Kariba Village year round. They breed in summer and the nest is a large untidy bowl-shaped nest well hidden in a thicket or other dense vegetation. The nest has a thin, roughly constructed roof or dome. They often make use of bushes covered with creepers in gardens to hide the nest, but like other coucals, once there are chicks in the nest the adult’s regular coming and going soon pinpoint the position of the nest. Before they can fly, the young coucals start making exploratory excursions around the garden once their feathers have developed. &#9;</p>",

It readily establishes itself in gardens with shady vegetation, and quickly habituates to the presence of people, hopping about boldly on open ground at any time of the day.</p><p>The White-browed Robin-Chat is essentially a thicket species, and its numbers in any habitat are dependant on the number of leafy shrubs providing year-round cover. It readily establishes itself in gardens with shady vegetation, and quickly habituates to the presence of people, hopping about boldly on open ground at any time of the day.</p><p>Some of its open lawn exploits have earned it a reputation for pugnacity, for it moves with vigorous hops (some of them sideways) to drive off other species such as thrushes and shrikes. When it has a nest or fledglings nearby it is particularly bold in attacking potential predators. I have seen one attack a 1.8&#160;m Boomslang that was crossing an aerial gap between neighbouring fig trees, seizing the snake briefly behind the head and pulling it momentarily off course.</p><p>Like other robin-chats the White-browed is a regular bather, using garden birdbaths, rain puddles and, in the evening twilight, the shallows of narrow, forest-lined rivers.</p><p>It has a loud contact call, a flute-like whistle of several syllables, which varies geographically. In Zimbabwe it is a fast-paced four-syllable call, aptly transcribed as ‘Don’t-you-do-it, don’t-you-do-it’, while in the eastern lowveld of South Africa it sounds like ‘putt-poo-lee’, or sometimes ‘pep-pep-pep-poolee’. Despite the wide range of variation, there is a certain quality to the call which immediately provides a clue to the perpetrator. Although this species is most vocal when breeding, they normally call at first light every morning, creating a natural alarm clock in gardens where they occur.</p><p>Its song is even more distinctive. The male repeats a motif of four or more notes, softly at first but gaining in volume in a perfect crescendo, the final phrases very loud, the singing bird pumping out its notes compulsively with its air sacs visibly inflated. This is one of the characteristic bird songs of riverbank forests in much of the African savanna. The female often joins in, interjecting loud ‘tsreeee’ notes at the peak of her mate’s crescendo. If she chooses not to accompany him, the male can actually sing her part as well in a masterly demonstration of vocal gymnastics.</p><p>These sedentary robin-chats occupy a territorial area of about one hectare throughout the year. In territorial defence against a trespassing male, the mated pair sing their antiphonal duets, perching higher than the intruder and circling him in the course of the singing contest. This is not always effective, however, and territorial disputes can get physical if the intruder is persistent, with combatants grappling in mid-air and falling to ground to continue their fighting until exhausted, the victor keeping up subdued song even while lying on the ground next to its antagonist. On rare occasions, however, such disputes may become deadly, with one of the combatants being killed.</p><p>In southern Africa, breeding by this species occurs during the summer rains. The nest is built in less than a week and the usual two eggs hatch after 14-15 days’ incubation by the female. Both parents feed the chicks which fledge after some 15 days. At this age they flutter rather than fly, and scramble to conceal themselves in thickets or to squat on the ground under cover, fluttering up to low perches when a parent approaches with food. If danger approaches the adults utter persistent rattle notes interspersed with mimicked alarm calls of other local birds. This is the only circumstance in which the White-browed Robin-Chat mimics other birds’ calls.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Usually encountered singly or in pairs, this scrub-robin is seldom far from some thicket in which it can hide. Exaggerated tail movements (in which the vertically cocked tail almost touches the back of the head) are an integral part of its behaviour. Another habit, especially when anxious or alarmed, is to droop both wings spasmodically, until the tips touch the ground or the perch. The wing-drooping exposes the white in the wings and is used to communicate with its mate. The white in the tail is also used as an alarm signal to the mate. These birds forage mainly on the ground and use both hopping and running gaits. If disturbed by the approach of an observer, the bird may fly up briefly before dropping back to the ground behind a grass tussock, from where it runs like a mouse to the cover of the nearest thicket.</p><p>Though not always easy to see, the White-browed Scrub-Robin draws attention with its vocalisations. It has a loud, ratchet-like alarm call, most frequently uttered when its nest or fledglings are threatened, but also voiced when it encounters any potential predator.</p><p>Though not always easy to see, the White-browed Scrub-Robin draws attention with its vocalisations. It has a loud, ratchet-like alarm call, most frequently uttered when its nest or fledglings are threatened, but also voiced when it encounters any potential predator.</p><p>Its territorial advertisement song is strident and persistent during the spring and summer breeding season, when individual males may indulge in virtually non-stop bouts of singing lasting 40 minutes or more.</p><p>A third type of vocalisation is a whistled song call ‘peep-boo-go’, rather like a similar call of the Rufous-naped Lark Mirafra africana. This call is uttered by both male and female at any time of the day throughout the year, but especially after sunset. This scrub-robin is usually the last of the diurnal birds to sing, and its descending three-syllable call is a characteristic sound of the evening twilight in African woodlands.</p><p>The mainly insectivorous diet of these scrub-robins is varied, with small berries and aloe nectar in season. They are common in bushveld wildlife reserves where short-cropped sward and game paths facilitate ground foraging, and numerous animal scats yield insect larvae. One of my favourite memories is of early morning sunlight in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve highlighting a foraging White-browed Scrub-Robin that was clambering around like a transformed dung beetle on a cannon-ball-sized offering from a Black Rhinoceros!</p><p>The open cup nest is commonly placed in the centre of a grass tussock, often at the base of a small tree that can provide shade. The female is largely responsible for its construction, which can be accomplished in as little as eight hours. The female incubates 2–3 eggs; these may hatch in less than 14 days. Both parents feed the chicks, which are capable of fledging as young as 11 days old.</p><p>White-browed Scrub-Robins are common in southern, central and eastern Africa and exhibit considerable geographic variation in plumage colouration, most of it involving minor differences in colour of the crown and mantle. A notable exception, however, involves birds resident in the north-west of the southern African region. Unlike ‘normal’ White-browed Scrub-Robins characterised by darkly streaked chests, the race ovamboensis has only faint streaking on the lower throat. It also has a grey (instead of brown) head, and much more white on the wing coverts. Birders have problems with its identification because it lacks the dark chest striations.</p><p>This plumage difference provides a clue to the probable origin of these birds, for they look identical to White-browed Scrub-Robins occurring in arid parts of Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia. The Ovambo scrub-robins are likely descendants of immigrants that moved down from north-east Africa via the dry corridor that connected the north-east and south-west arid zones during the ice ages of the Pleistocene era.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This is the petrel most frequently encountered at sea around most of the southern African coast, and usually is the first truly pelagic bird seen when heading out to sea. It occurs year-round off the south and west coasts, but is mainly a winter visitor off the east coast. It could be confused with the Great-winged Petrel, but is larger with blacker plumage and a prominent whitish bill. Its name is not very appropriate, because the white chin is often small and inconspicuous. However, birds regularly have white patches elsewhere on their plumage, especially on the head and belly. Its flight action is intermediate between the loose-winged, high-rising action of the gadfly petrels, and the more direct, stiff-winged, glide-and-flap action of the shearwaters.</p><p>White-chinned Petrels are inveterate ship-followers, remaining with a vessel for hours on end, pouncing on any food dumped overboard. Large numbers aggregate at fishing vessels to scavenge scraps and discards. At trawlers, they often form large roosts on the water, frequently with albatrosses and shearwaters. Once they hear the winches start, signalling that the net is being pulled, they take to the air to jockey for position behind the vessel. But they do not rely entirely on hand-outs. Over the continental shelf they target small fish (e.g. Anchovies, Red-eyes, Lanternfish and Lightfish), crustaceans (e.g. mantis shrimps), squid and cuttlefish. Prey items are obtained by surface-seizing, shallow plunge-diving or pursuit-diving, using their partly closed wings and feet to propel them underwater. They often swim at the surface with their heads underwater, scanning for prey, then submerge with a flick of their wings, descending to at least 12 metres.</p><p>White-chinned Petrels are inveterate ship-followers, remaining with a vessel for hours on end, pouncing on any food dumped overboard.

They often swim at the surface with their heads underwater, scanning for prey, then submerge with a flick of their wings, descending to at least 12 metres.</p><p>They breed in summer at sub-Antarctic islands throughout the Southern Ocean. As the largest of the burrowing petrels, they dig large burrows that often have a pool at their entrance. At the start of the breeding season, birds call endlessly from the entrances to their burrows, giving a monotonous, high-pitched chittering call. Even when breeding they are highly mobile. Birds from islands in the Indian Ocean forage over a vast range from the temperate waters off southern Africa to the frigid waters bordering the Antarctic continent. Recent genetic work shows that the species originated in the New Zealand region, and spread fairly recently throughout the sub-Antarctic. Birds occurring in southern Africa probably come from colonies in the south-west Indian Ocean.</p><p>Historically, large numbers of White-chinned Petrels or ‘Bassiaan’ were caught for food off southern Africa. Fortunately this practice largely ceased in the 1980s, but thousands were killed annually in the 1990s by longline fisheries. Mortalities on demersal longlines were greatly reduced by changes to fishing practices, but hundreds are still killed annually on pelagic longlines targeting tunas and swordfish off southern Africa. It remains the seabird most often caught on fishing gear in the Southern Ocean, with some 40 000 estimated to be killed annually. Limiting the impacts of pelagic fisheries is complicated by their ability to forage efficiently by night as well as by day, coupled with their deeper dives than most other species caught on longlines. Despite having a total population of perhaps 10 million birds, several studies suggest that the numbers of White-chinned Petrels have decreased over the last few decades. Given their ongoing mortality on fishing gear, they are listed as Vulnerable.</p>",

It is a communal species, commonly seen in small groups, or in larger aggregations at fruit-laden trees. When not feeding, these barbets often resort to prominent perches on bare branches at the tops of trees. Unfortunately, burgeoning human settlements are causing the destruction of these forests and the consequent extirpation of local populations of these barbets.</p><p>The White-eared Barbet makes a fair amount of noise, although not necessarily tuneful to the human ear.

Their calls are generally described as harsh and high-pitched, likened to ‘shreee, shreee…’, and greeting displays involve much bowing, accompanied by chattering, trilling and bill-wiping.</p><p>Groups are probably made up of an adult pair and related adult and subadult progeny. They roost together in excavated chambers, to which access is gained by an entrance hole approximately 50 mm across. On an early morning walk in the fig forest lining the Mkuze River, I counted eleven White-eared Barbets emerging one after another from a hole in a comparatively slender tree limb. The roosting chamber must have been a deep one, allowing the birds to sleep stacked one on top of another. The generic name Stactolaema for this species thus seems humorously appropriate. However, the Greek Staktos means oozing out by drops, and the name, originally given to Anchieta’s Barbet (S. anchietae), a Miombo woodland species occurring north of the Zambezi River, apparently refers to the drip-like marks on the sides of that species’ breast.</p><p>Nest holes and chambers are usually excavated in dead wood of trees such as Sycomore Figs, which are abundant in this barbet’s preferred habitat. Waterberry (Syzygium) and coral trees (Erythrina), both of which have soft-grained wood, are also chosen. The birds usually make a hole in the underside of a dead, sloping limb, and the breeding pair take turns to chew their way at right angles into the branch until the hole is deep enough to accommodate the head and body of the labouring barbet. Thereafter, the downward excavation of the breeding chamber starts. One pair took six weeks to excavate the hole and chamber, unassisted by any helpers; however, three different birds subsequently were observed feeding the chicks at this nest.</p><p>White-eared Barbets typically are co-operative breeders with one to six helpers. At the nest described above with one helper, it transpired that there were five chicks. During the first half of the day they were fed 14-19 times per hour. Of the feeding visits observed, fruit was brought 36% of the time, with the remaining feeds comprising insects. Most fruit were figs from the Giant-leaved Fig Ficus lutea, with some papaya and mango for occasional variation. The insect food was mostly grasshoppers and crickets, including two large, green armoured locusts (Phymateus sp.) which are presumed to be distasteful. These had to be thoroughly beaten and dismembered into small portions before the chicks would accept them. Other insects included cockroaches, wasps, a cicada and a dragonfly. All of these items had to be pounded into submission before being offered to the chicks. Provisioning of chicks occurred throughout the day, tailing off during the final hour of daylight. It continued for 39 days, after which the five chicks left the nest, but returned each night with the three adults to roost in the nest chamber.&#9;</p>",

Birds from Tristan da Cunha and Gough Islands in the central South Atlantic probably account for the occasional records off the Cape in April-May, as well as one record from Namibia. However, birds seen in the Mozambique Channel probably derive from the population breeding on islands around southern Australia and New Zealand. There is only one record of a White-faced Storm Petrel ashore in South Africa; it was caught in a mist net on Dyer Island, just west of Cape Agulhas, in October 2001. October is the start of the breeding season, and it may have been prospecting for a possible breeding site, although it would be unlikely to find a partner so far from any established colony.</p><p>White-faced Storm Petrels have a remarkably low wing loading, bounding as if on springs over the water, which accounts for their Tristan name ‘Skipjack’.

In flight they are a very dark duck because the wings are black. They have a remarkably upright stance and have comparatively long legs and neck for a duck. When swimming, they appear to float high in the water. However, the most distinctive feature is their whistling call ‘whee-whee-wheeer’, which is given both in flight and on the ground. Another unusual feature of this duck is that when a loafing flock on a bank is disturbed, the birds take off and then fly in a circle coming back over the person who has caused the disturbance. Crocodiles often choose to haul out onto sandbanks and bask next to groups of White-faced Ducks, using them as reliable sentinels.</p><p>The White-faced Duck is probably one of the most numerous and common of all the ducks in southern Africa and is found almost throughout the subregion outside the true desert areas of the Kalahari and Namibia. It is found throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and in Madagascar. It also occurs in most of South America. When I first moved to George in the southern Cape ten years ago this species was relatively uncommon and was always remarked upon, but has become more and more common as the years have passed.</p><p>The White-faced Duck is probably one of the most numerous and common of all the ducks in southern Africa and is found almost throughout the subregion outside the true desert areas of the Kalahari and Namibia.

After feeding the flock will move to clean water and spend a lot of time cleaning the mud off their feathers. On one occasion when a groundnut crop was flooded by exceptionally heavy rain and the nuts were floating in the water, the White-faced Ducks and the Spur-winged Geese arrived in their hundreds to eat the nuts.</p><p>This species, like all the ducks, drop all their flight feathers at the same time, usually in winter, and so they have to find a suitably large water body where they will be safe from predators while they cannot fly. They are known to gather on certain favoured permanent bodies of water but the numbers gathering to moult vary tremendously from year to year. For the rest of the year they tend to be highly nomadic, moving from one area to the next, depending on the rain in these different areas.</p><p>The birds breed when rains fill up ephemeral wetlands, and it is remarkable how they can appear in an area almost immediately following extensive rain. The nests are hidden in waterside vegetation which usually grows quickly once a pan fills. The nest is a basin of grass with little or no down, and normally both sexes incubate the eggs to ensure that the eggs are never left uncovered. My observation of this species breeding at Voëlvlei in the southern Cape is that the birds sit very tight because they are so well concealed and they will only leave when one gets very close to the nest. It has been recorded that pair bonding is reinforced by regular mutual allopreening, where one member of the pair preens its mate.</p><p>When the eggs hatch the ducklings are escorted by both adults to the nearest water and generally protected from predators. It appears that breeding success is high, and this is one of the reasons why this species is so widespread and common.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>‘One for all, and all for one’ epitomises the life history of the White-fronted Bee-eater, which is quite different from that of the other southern African bee-eaters. Superficially, this species can be described as a colonially breeding resident, which already sets it apart from its congeners, some of which breed colonially but are migratory, while others are resident but breed solitarily – and there are some which don’t breed in southern Africa at all. However, it is the intricate social organisation that sets this species apart from the others and makes it so interesting – it has one of the most complex societies recorded among birds. From studies conducted in Kenya, it is known that the basic social unit – or family – consists of a pair, with between one and five ‘helpers’ which are usually (but not always) members of the previous season’s brood. Each family forms close ties with several other breeding units from the same colony and together they comprise a clan. These clans are territorial and defend their feeding area from other clans, thereby assuring the food supply for the whole clan.</p><p>The helpers associated with each pair play a supportive role during breeding, and their activities have been shown to contribute to increased chick survival. Large broods of four chicks cannot be reared by unassisted parents – the fourth chick invariably dies and the third is often severely handicapped too. This is a good example of co-operative breeding; the helpers assist with excavation of the nest tunnel, feed the breeding female and contribute to provisioning the chicks. However, some of the helpers may be experienced breeders, and may occasionally copulate with the breeding female. Males also have extra-pair ‘affairs’ and to top it all, females often lay their eggs in other White-fronted Bee-eater nests. The end result is that a significant percentage of chicks are unrelated to one or both parents. Perhaps this should be referred to as communal, rather than colonial breeding?</p><p>The helpers associated with each pair play a supportive role during breeding, and their activities have been shown to contribute to increased chick survival.

The end result is that a significant percentage of chicks are unrelated to one or both parents. Perhaps this should be referred to as communal, rather than colonial breeding?</p><p>Some of the sharing between clan members is voluntary, but there is also redistribution of resources by force. When nesting, some breeding birds remain at the colony and steal food from returning parents to feed the parasite’s chicks. By our standards, this extraordinary, communal lifestyle seems anarchic, but obviously it works for the White-fronted Bee-eater!</p><p>In other respects, the White-fronted Bee-eater is a typical bee-eater. It eats mainly bees and their relatives which it hawks from a perch, to which it returns to de-venom and kill the bees before swallowing them. In Zimbabwe, the bulk of the diet comprises dragonflies and damselflies, with cicadas being a prominent component during summer, along with grasshoppers, robber flies and other insects. Foraging takes place within a radius of about ten kilometres of the colony, as this species is quite sedentary. Feeding territories remain stable over time and are used and defended by the clan on a daily basis. Within the territory, the birds forage solitarily but maintain vocal contact with other clan members. When birds actually meet, they greet each other excitedly, calling and tail-quivering, in a most endearing way.</p><p>White-fronted Bee-eaters are found along large rivers with sandy banks where they excavate breeding burrows. They occur in the mesic northern and eastern parts of southern Africa, from northern Botswana and the Zambezi Region, through Zimbabwe and north-eastern South Africa to Swaziland; they are surprisingly scarce in Mozambique. Colonies usually have about 30-40 birds and the nest bank can be along any river or stream. They also use banks created by farmers when they dig large trenches for silage storage. Its range has expanded in historical times into the Free State and Northern Cape in South Africa, and consequently its future looks secure.&#9;</p>",

Although it only breeds on a handful of sub-Antarctic islands in the south Indian Ocean and off New Zealand, it ranges widely throughout the Southern Ocean. It occurs from close to the Antarctic continent north into temperate waters and, given its presence throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean, at least some birds presumably circumnavigate the Southern Ocean. It is very rare over the continental shelf in southern Africa, but occurs at low densities year-round in oceanic waters south and east of the continent. It often rests on the water, and is moderately attracted to ships, often circling a few times before moving on. Like most gadfly petrels, squid predominate in its diet. Introduced predators have affected populations at several breeding islands, but the population of some 250 000 pairs is not considered to be threatened.</p>",

The juveniles have brown fluff on their heads and so lack this distinction. The adults and juveniles both have heavy red bills, while the legs and feet are pink. Overall, the bird looks black with a white belly and leggings, and in flight shows a distinctive black-and-white pattern from below. These vultures are approximately the same size as the White-backed Vulture but are somewhat smaller than the Lappet-faced Vulture, which shows a very different black-and-white flight pattern.</p><p>The White-headed Vulture is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, though nowhere common. In our region it occurs over a large part of northern Namibia and over most of Botswana. In Zimbabwe they are limited to the Zambezi, Save and Limpopo valleys, and they extend southwards through the Kruger and northern KwaZulu-Natal, as well as eastwards into Mozambique.  Unlike the other medium-sized vultures, this bird is either encountered singly or in pairs. They do sometimes gather in small numbers at carcasses, and we saw up to six of them when we were photographing vultures feeding on an elephant carcass in the Gona-re-Zhou. In South Africa they are largely restricted to game reserves and national parks, but because they are so striking, they are probably recorded more often by non-birders than are some of the other more common vultures.</p><p>The White-headed Vulture is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, though nowhere common.

Recorded prey is varied and numerous, including mammals (such as Porcupine, Scrub Hare, hyrax, Bat-eared Fox, the tiny Dik-Dik antelope, and Caracal), also birds (such as ducks, guineafowl and korhaan) and reptiles (such as Puffadders and pythons). And, like so many birds in this book, they feast on termite alates when these are emerging.</p><p>This species, like many vultures, will often bathe around midday, especially in hot weather and will then stand in the sun with the wings held out to dry, revealing the black-and-white wing pattern. They may spend an hour or two on a sand bank in a river before lifting off and soaring again. They have also been recorded as standing in water on hot days – just like the Bateleurs regularly do.</p><p>Their nest is a large basin-shaped platform of sticks which is lined with grass, usually in a tree which is taller than those surrounding it. Studies of this species in Zimbabwe showed that nests were usually well separated – about 10 kilometres or so apart. The majority of nests are built in various species of thorn tree, especially the Knob Thorn Acacia nigrescens and Camel Thorn Acacia erioloba. However, about a third of the nests are placed in Baobab Trees, and are therefore very conspicuous when the trees lose their leaves.</p><p>The birds lay one egg, usually in June or July but sometimes later, from August to October. The eggs are incubated for between 55 and 60 days, and the nestling period is usually approximately 120 days. After fledging, the adults continue to feed the chicks for a further five months. The immature birds wander around somewhat nomadically but the adults are usually resident in their chosen territory.</p>",

The local White-necked Raven pair seldom misses this opportunity to play, wheeling and diving in the turbulent air currents, then riding the updraught on broad wings and rocketing skyward. Such behaviour seems rooted in the enjoyment of flight and has little to do with the usual daily activities of searching for roadkills (these ravens are often the first scavengers to arrive at a road carcass) or harassing any eagle or other bird of prey that they come across.</p><p>White-necked Ravens are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in mountainous areas. Their ‘krerk’ call is characteristic of rocky hills and mountain slopes, often drawing one’s attention to a black speck soaring high overhead. They have not been slow to adapt to built-up areas within range of their mountain retreats, however, because cities and towns abound with scavenging opportunities for canny corvids (members of the crow family – Corvidae), though they are generally less urban than Pied Crows.</p><p>White-necked Ravens are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in mountainous areas.

The raven holds the egg lengthways in its large, arched beak and flies off with it to a convenient perch where it bangs the egg against a branch until it cracks, and then catches and swallows the yolk and albumen as it runs out. Ravens are also bad news for small tortoises because if they find one they will fly up with it to a height of some 15 metres and drop it repeatedly onto an ‘anvil’ (a rock or other hard surface) until the shell breaks.</p><p>White-necked Ravens are, in fact, truly omnivorous, meaning that they will eat just about anything. They catch lizards and small snakes, small birds, and large insects. They have been observed associating with large mammals (Warthog, Buffalo, horses and cattle) and gleaning the animals of ticks. They also eat grain and groundnuts and even enjoy aloe nectar. I have seen one of these birds perched on the horizontal flower stalk of a Mountain Aloe Aloe marlothii, sipping nectar from the upward-pointing florets (this is probably the only aloe with flower stalks sturdy enough to support the three-quarter kilogram weight of a raven). They are keen on Dovyalis fruit, especially the Oval Kei-apple Dovyalis caffra and will fly more than 10 kilometres to eat the fruit.</p><p>At the vulture restaurant in the Giants Castle Game Reserve in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Drakensberg these ravens are something of a nuisance. The ‘restaurant’ is maintained for the benefit of the rare Bearded Vulture, but the White-necked Ravens tend to monopolise it and to harass any vulture that arrives to feed by walking around behind it and tweaking its tail feathers. Northern Hemisphere raven species behave in the same manner to drive large raptors away from their kills or from carrion.</p><p>A White-necked Raven pair maintains a territory and chases off others of their kind that trespass. However, flocks may form in the non-breeding season, either when attracted by carrion, or to indulge in aerial play at popular sites in propitious weather.</p><p>Ravens are the subject of varied superstitions in different parts of the world, and may consequently be the object of fear or of reverence. Their real life habits may also make them unpopular with many people. Whatever one’s feelings, however, the White-necked Ravens’ call is part of the ambience of some of the most scenic regions of southern Africa, and the aerial play of these birds is always wonderful to observe.</p>",

It is quieter and is usually a solitary nester and therefore less often forms calling flocks or ‘circuses’. It has also benefited from buildings and other constructions, but indirectly, because it mostly usurps the closed nests of the two striped swallows, South African Cliff Swallow and Little Swift, all species which now nest mainly on these structures. The nests of swallows, building half-cup nests, are also occasionally used, with the mud walls of these built up to the ceiling with materials collected in flight, mostly feathers and plant detritus, glued together with saliva. While they may also nest in suitable cavities under the eaves of houses, it is for their habit of using striped swallow nests on houses that they are better known, and frequently disliked.</p><p>They are unpopular for two reasons: first, they are not nearly as charismatic as the swallow species, and second, nests taken over are sometimes still occupied – the swallows are harassed (sometimes by groups of four to six swifts – presumably pairs competing for the same nest) and the eggs ejected, while chicks are similarly treated, or are smothered. The victors will refuse to budge and can, unlike the swallows, fast for several days in the nest. However, once a pair has usurped a nest, they are by no means secure and may in turn be evicted by another pair of White-rumped Swifts! Although homeowners will usually notice that their swallows are no longer around after a nest has been usurped by these swifts, they may not realise that there are new occupants; the swifts’ flight is fast and manoeuvrable and they slip into the nest tunnel at full tilt.</p><p>They are unpopular for two reasons: first, they are not nearly as charismatic as the swallow species, and second, nests taken over are sometimes still occupied – the swallows are harassed (sometimes by groups of four to six swifts – presumably pairs competing for the same nest) and the eggs ejected, while chicks are similarly treated, or are smothered.

Once this lining is completed an occupied nest can be recognised by the feathers protruding from the entrance; these are reported to hinder entry by the origi&#173;nal owners.</p><p>When the chicks are about 10 days old they reverse to the entrance to deposit their droppings below the nest. This is another sore point with homeowners and is in contrast to the former nest owners, which swallow the fresh faeces of young chicks and carry away those of larger chicks. The problem of mess can be overcome by placing a board or other catcher below the nest to catch the droppings.</p><p>Both members of the adult pair incubate the eggs and tend to the young, but a report from Zimbabwe mentioned breeding pairs having up to five ‘helpers’ at the nest, apparently offspring from previous broods, which seemed to assist with feeding the young. However, the birds were not individually marked, so provisioning by helpers needs to be investigated more closely.</p><p>White-rumped Swifts usually raise two broods, and at the end of the breeding season most of the birds leave southern Africa (a few overwinter), probably to spend their non-breeding months in Equatorial Africa. Pairs tend to return to use their adopted nests the following season. In a study in the Western Cape one ringed bird returned to a Greater Striped Swallow nest (which had been artificially reinforced with plaster of Paris) for nine successive years, while another swallow nest elsewhere was used for 13 years (by more than one pair), to produce at least 25 broods.&#9;</p>",

They forage on the ground, in rela&#173;tively open undergrowth and seldom spend much time more than four or five meters above the ground. Visibility at these levels is about ten metres, and the bright apricot yellow of the chest and belly and the big yellow panels in the tail, quickly draw attention to the birds. But you are not likely to see those stars; most of the time they are covered by the blue-grey feathering of the head. They can however be flashed or turned on in times of agitation or concern, as when one peers into a nest at close range or when the bird is about to tackle a creature that might fight back. There is a third star that is outlined in black and situated in the middle of the bottom edge of the blue-grey throat. This seems to be reserved for close-range courtship.</p><p>There is another unusual feature of this species’ plumage. The main body plumage of most of our robins as they leave the nest is dull and speckled or mottled, with contrasting tips to many of the feathers. This juvenile plumage is moulted out some three months after hatching and the adult plumage is assumed in its place. But this bird has an additional intermediate phase in which our birds take on a plain olive green set of body feathers which they retain for nearly a year before moulting into adult plumage.</p><p>There is another unusual feature of this species’ plumage.

But this bird has an additional intermediate phase in which our birds take on a plain olive green set of body feathers which they retain for nearly a year before moulting into adult plumage.</p><p>These birds are also quite vocal and so attract attention to their presence. What is most interesting about the calls is that there are two very different versions of the most frequently heard contact call, which is also used in response to the presence of unwanted intruders like birdwatchers. The populations from the vicinity of Knysna up to the Umfolozi River on the east coast use a simple two-note call ‘too-tweee’. But north of the Umfolozi and up through Zimbabwe a longer call of six or more syllables is used for the same purpose. This is a rather soft, halting call which can be likened to: ‘There ARE, six, BIGwhite, hors-es’. Two-note populations take no notice of recordings of this longer version and vice versa. But each population responds to its own version. Go north of the Zambezi and the two-note call is again used all the way up to southern Sudan except for a couple of small isolated forest patches south of Mombasa. Within southern Africa the difference in the calls of these two populations is also reflected in plumage differences leading to the recognition of two races, one south of the Umfolozi River and the other up to the Zambezi.</p><p>Another feature peculiar to this species is the domed nest. Not all nests are covered over but the great majority are built on the ground amongst leaf litter and have a roof of dry leaves, moss, a few tendrils, and general forest floor detritus. Otherwise all other robins build open cup nests with the possible exception of one of the mountain robins of south-eastern Nigeria and Cameroon. Whatever the object or advantage may be, it is not an effective defence against being parasitised by the Red-chested Cuckoo even though the cuckoo egg, usually a uniform milk chocolate colour, looks very different from the white, lightly speckled robin eggs.&#9;</p>",

Its breeding range extends from mainland Europe across Asia, and a large portion of this population migrates to Africa, where ‘wintering’ birds occur across 47 degrees of latitude from Ethiopia to the south-western Cape in South Africa. Like many large migrant birds, the White Stork is a daytime flyer, using thermals to gain height, and gliding at speeds of up to 28 km/h until it reaches the next uplift. European populations take one of two routes into Africa: storks breeding west of a line between Switzerland and the eastern Netherlands head southwest to cross the Mediterranean at Gibraltar, the others (which include most of those that come to southern Africa) fly south-east through Turkey and the Middle East. Experimental exchanges of eggs or chicks between western and eastern European nests have shown that the young birds are instinctively programmed with the appropriate heading for their region.</p><p>About three quarters of the White Storks visiting southern Africa are young birds in their first year. Arrivals start in October, and departure dates for the northward return journey extend from March to May. Some birds remain here during the southern winter; such individuals are usually underweight and sickly, and few survive the rigours of the winter dryness and cold nights of our summer rainfall region. The winter rainfall areas seem to be better tolerated, and spasmodic breeding occurs by stay-over birds near Cape Town, Bredasdorp, Mossel Bay and Oudsthoorn. Breeding behaviour usually commences at the age of four years. Estimated mortality rates of younger birds are 59%, 47% and 36% for those in their first, second and third years respectively; the estimated adult mortality rate is much lower at 17%. Commonly reported causes of death in southern Africa are from collisions with overhead power lines or fences, and from severe hail storms.</p><p>About three quarters of the White Storks visiting southern Africa are young birds in their first year. Arrivals start in October, and departure dates for the northward return journey extend from March to May. Some birds remain here during the southern winter; such individuals are usually underweight and sickly, and few survive the rigours of the winter dryness and cold nights of our summer rainfall region. The winter rainfall areas seem to be better tolerated, and spasmodic breeding occurs by stay-over birds near Cape Town, Bredasdorp, Mossel Bay and Oudsthoorn.

Commonly reported causes of death in southern Africa are from collisions with overhead power lines or fences, and from severe hail storms.</p><p>In Africa, White Storks are usually encountered in flocks, commonly of 10 to 50 individuals. Grass fires attract them and they stalk through the smoke behind the fire front, feasting on dead or incapacitated victims of the flames. Brown Locust swarms provide the most popular feasts, and attract huge aggregations of these storks – sometimes in excess of 20 000. Infestations of caterpillars in crops can result in thousands of birds gathering – they can clear the infestation in a matter of days!</p><p>Members of a flock roost together, usually in a dead tree, a wetland or farm dam, standing almost belly deep in water. Groups may also loaf near water during midday hours. When gathering to roost, staccato bill-clapping frequently occurs. It is really the only loud sound that these birds make, and it is also used as a greeting ceremony between mates at the nest.</p><p>The moister eastern areas of the subcontinent are preferred by White Storks to the dry western regions, but they are quick to exploit the abundant food resources of shallow wetlands, irrigated pastures and especially of butterfly-rich lucerne fields wherever these occur.</p><p>A unique habit of storks is to squirt faeces on their legs when heat-stressed, as the arteries and veins in the legs are adapted to act as efficient heat exchangers. Some individuals have seemingly whitewashed legs due to this behaviour.</p><p>White Storks usually fare well at their migratory destinations in Africa, but in their European breeding grounds they face increasing threat from lack of nesting sites, due to replacement of traditional homes by apartment blocks and skyscrapers, and from degradation of habitat and food supply resulting from change in farming practice and increasing use of agrochemicals.</p>",

It has a reputation for being shy and retiring, but it readily ventures into gardens offering a diversity of shelter and habitat. In Zimbabwe, in thickets associated with rocks in Brachystegia woodland, it is a very covert species, often heard, but seldom venturing out into the open.</p><p>Like the Cape Robin-Chat, it sings in early morning and (to a lesser extent) after sunset, almost throughout the year. Although individual Cape Robin-Chats copy other birds’ calls, all White-throated Robin-Chats are masterful mimics. Their imi&#173;tations, though perfect, are seldom as loud as the original from birds such as, for example, the Sombre Greenbul. The song is high-pitched and melodic, with each phrase about 10 seconds long, and is customarily delivered from the highest available perch, usually in a treetop. During the noon hours, particularly on hot days, the male is apt to sing a quiet soliloquy from a concealed perch low down in a favourite thicket.</p><p>Like the Cape Robin-Chat, it sings in early morning and (to a lesser extent) after sunset, almost throughout the year.

During the noon hours, particularly on hot days, the male is apt to sing a quiet soliloquy from a concealed perch low down in a favourite thicket.</p><p>The contact call is a plaintive, whistled ‘seep-chweeyoo’. The sound is strikingly similar to that made when a bicycle tyre is pumped up, so it is appropriately dubbed the ‘bicycle-pump call’ by those familiar with it. It is uttered by both sexes throughout the year, and by young birds from ten weeks of age.</p><p>The alarm call is a soft ‘burg’, exactly like one of the syllables of the Cape Robin-&#173;Chats ‘gurg-gur-gurg’ alarm call. It becomes louder when danger threatens the nest or fledged young. It is also used when arriving at and leaving the chosen roosting site.</p><p>In Zululand I observed a garden-dwelling White-throated Robin-Chat that, in the course of two weeks, roosted three times on different, slender, leafless branches protruding from a thick hibiscus hedge. It only did this when there were blustery northerly winds; on such occasions its exposed perch was always on the sheltered southern side of the east/west-aligned hedge. Searches on calm nights failed to locate it; perhaps on those occasions it chose to roost within the hedge. On another occasion, in a different locality, a torchlight foray revealed a pair of these birds roosting together about 2 m above ground level on a perch in the top of a thickly foliaged shrub; sheltered sites such as this are the ones usually chosen.</p><p>Surface water is scarce in this robin-chat’s preferred habitat, so it readily bathes in rainwater puddles and garden sprays.</p><p>White-throated Robin-Chats are largely insectivorous, eating ants, termites and small beetles, with crickets, plant bugs and spiders adding variety. They also take small fruits of plants such as Grewia and Euclea. Most foraging is done on the ground, but flying insects are hawked and small berries are often plucked on the wing.</p><p>The male defends territory throughout the year, and can be highly pugnacious towards other males and other birds. In aggressive display the singing male crouches with head held low and upright, fully-fanned tail. Chasing often ensues with aggressive beak-clicking, and rivals may grapple in flight and fall to the ground with claws locked, before parting. The fully-fanned tail also plays a prominent part in courtship display, both raised and depressed to show its underside, with the male standing very upright and displaying his immaculate white throat and chest.</p><p>Most nests of this species (94%) are built on the ground, often at the base of a small tree, rock or vine. They are very well concealed, with cup rim being level with the ground. Nevertheless, over 40% of nests fail from predation of eggs or chicks.  The White-throated Robin-Chat is an occasional host of the Red-chested Cuckoo Cuculus solitarius.&#9;</p>",

Some birds overwinter, especially in Zimbabwe, which is not far south of the suspected sub-Equatorial non-breeding destination of this species.</p><p>In size and general appearance the White-throated Swallow is very similar to its European counterpart, the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica, the main difference between the two being the throat colour, which is russet in the Palaearctic bird. These two swallows, along with three other similar species found elsewhere in Africa, all associate with human habitation, construct half-cup mud nests on rock faces or walls of buildings or culverts, and all are evidently derived from the same ancestral stock.</p><p>In size and general appearance the White-throated Swallow is very similar to its European counterpart, the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica, the main difference between the two being the throat colour, which is russet in the Palaearctic bird.

It shows a similar preference for cooler regions, but it is usually less likely than the striped swallow to build a nest on the wall of your veranda. This is because the White-throated Swallow has a predilection for nesting over water, including sheltered bays in the sea; so bridges, culverts and harbour walls are commonly preferred to houses. Unlike the colonial Cliff Swallows Hirundo spilodera, which build hundreds of nests under the same bridge, White-throated Swallows are solitary nesters. They raise up to three broods per season, and a pair may build more than one nest in a culvert when high mite infestations promote regular cycling of nest use. At a density of one pair of swallows per bridge, swallow pairs usually outnumber bridges and culverts, so alternative sites often have to be found.</p><p>The nests are built largely of mud, so protection from rain is imperative, and a covered site is a necessity. Bridge or culvert sites shield the contents of open cup nests from the sun, provide equable temperature and humidity and, importantly, good protection from most predators. But in areas with no perennial streams necessitating bridges or culverts for local road networks, these swallows have to find alternative sheltered sites, and under-eve walls of houses may be used, even though there is no pool of water beneath.</p><p>White-throated Swallows, like all their kin, feed on the wing, catching small airborne insects such as aphids, thrips and midges, which emerge from water bodies because their larvae are aquatic. This range of very small airborne arthropods, which includes wind-blown hatchling spiders that disperse by using a long strand of silk as a paraglider, is often termed aerial plankton, and it forms the basic food supply for in-flight foragers such as swallows and swifts.</p><p>Moisture and warmth are important factors driving insect abundance and mobility, so aerial plankton feeders are normally well provided for during the summer months. Long dry spells, however, create food shortages for swallows, especially when droughts wither crops and dry up rivers and shallow wetlands. There may be very few insects in flight in such circumstances, and swallows either move away, or develop special strategies to find food for their young. In one particularly dry year in the Little Karoo, a pair of White-throated Swallows brought their fledglings each evening to a village lei-water reservoir from which chironomid flies were emerging at dusk. The young birds perched on the concrete wall, begging vociferously while their parents circled expertly over the limited surface area, along with Long-eared Bats that were also exploiting the feast. The fading light was too dim to pinpoint the positions of the perched fledglings except when the flying adult arrived to feed them, and the scene attested to the superb acuity of swallow eyesight.</p>",

It also makes use of garden fruiting trees and various other introduced fruit-bearing trees.

It is a rather heavily built bird and has a remarkably strong bill which can inflict considerable pain if one is bitten when handling a bird for ringing.</p><p>It spends most of the year in a group and may join mixed bird parties, but is more often found on its own. Although it is recorded as eating mainly fruit, especially the fruit of wild figs, observation in the Marondera area has shown that insects form an important part of its diet when wild figs are not fruiting.</p><p>Unlike most of our barbets, this species is not particularly noisy, but groups do call to one another, especially as they gather in a tree after feeding. The call is a fairly soft ‘coo-coo-coo’. Despite its low volume it does have considerable carrying power and birds can be heard from a hundred metres or so away. It also has a louder alarm call when threatened by a predator.</p><p>Like all barbets, it excavates holes in dead wood, using its strong bill to excavate a hole about 55 mm in diameter. The birds then dig downwards for as much as 300 mm into the dead wood if the branch is long enough. It prefers trees with softer wood like wild figs, and seldom uses hardwood trees such as the Musasa which occur in brachystegia woodlands. It was quite happy to use nest boxes provided on one farm where I studied the birds. The flock split up into pairs in early spring, with five pairs making use of five nests in the same patch of woodland. It lays pure white eggs and the chicks hatch naked with the eyes tightly shut but these open after a few days when they also start developing downy feathers. It may be parasitised by the Lesser Honeyguide which is quite common in the woodlands where it occurs. In Gosho Park two groups of breeding birds were recorded in two areas of woodlands separated by a river line, with grass and no trees, about one hundred metres wide. Both groups of birds made extensive use of nest boxes, but also excavated their own nests in pieces of dry fig tree logs we placed in trees.&#9;</p>",

Southwards its arrival is progressively later, usually early December in the southern Cape. This little bird is the ultimate LBJ, and because it forages in leafy vegetation it is easily overlooked. It can be found in woodland of all types, showing a preference for Acacia woods where available (including the Australian Black Wattle Acacia mearnsii plantations), and it regularly enters gardens with plentiful shrubs and trees.</p><p>It is primarily a leaf gleaner, feeding on small insects. Its average weight is about 9  g, less than a sheet of A4 paper in a standard-size envelope. Yet its annual round trip migration of up to 28&#160;000 km equals or (for some populations) significantly exceeds the distances travelled by Palaearctic migrant passerines twice its size. Like the majority of insectivorous migrants that conventionally forage in vegetation or on the ground, Willow Warblers migrate by night, feeding in daylight hours at stopover sites. Arrival weights of individuals in southern Africa may be as low as 6.5 g, only 50% of their fat-loaded mass at the start of their journey.</p><p>It is primarily a leaf gleaner, feeding on small insects.

For a significant proportion (more than in any other species of Palaearctic warbler) the target destination is South Africa, right down to the southern Cape. On the maxim that the migrants from the furthest north travel to the furthest south, some of these birds are likely to have travelled as much as 14&#160;000 km to get here.</p><p>Some of what we know about Willow Warbler migration has come from the live recapture of ringed birds (a Willow Warbler corpse is about as noticeable as a dead leaf, so dead ringed birds are hardly ever found). Although several thousand Willow Warblers have been ringed in southern Africa, there have been no recoveries of these birds in Europe. Local ringing and recapture has, however, revealed that Willow Warblers demonstrate fidelity to their non-breeding (‘winter’) quarters (as do several other Palaearctic warblers), and that some Willow Warblers have survived the formidable Sahara crossing at least five times.</p><p>One respect in which the Willow Warbler differs from almost all other Palaearctic passerines is that adult birds undergo two complete moults in each annual cycle – one post-breeding moult before migration, and a second at the non-breeding destination in Africa prior to the return trip. Each individual is thus equipped with a fresh set of flight feathers before setting off on its migratory flight.</p><p>What effect will climate change have on the current patterns of rainfall and prevailing winds? Both of these are critical factors for migrant birds, especially the smaller ones such as Willow Warblers. The Sahara is currently in an expansion phase (due to increasing human and domestic stock populations) and any climatic acceleration of this trend will likely prove disastrous.&#9;</p>",

It is the storm petrel most commonly seen in southern Africa, and is most abundant along the shelf break, but also is found over the continental shelf and in oceanic waters. It occurs year-round, and is more common in winter than in summer, but abundance peaks in March-May and September-October, presumably due to birds on migration.</p><p>Wilson’s Storm Petrels are also known as St Peter’s Birds, because of their habit of ‘walking on water’. While foraging they frequently dance over the water, pattering on the surface with their feet. This aids to keep them aloft while moving forward very slowly, scanning the water for their tiny prey, which comprises a variety of zooplankton, including small crustaceans, fish and squid, as well as scraps of larger prey. Substantial numbers scavenge behind fishing vessels. During the breeding season, crustaceans dominate their diets, and they are unusual in being able to digest the waxes used as an energy store by many small crustaceans.</p><p>Wilson’s Storm Petrels are also known as St Peter’s Birds, because of their habit of ‘walking on water’.

During the breeding season, crustaceans dominate their diets, and they are unusual in being able to digest the waxes used as an energy store by many small crustaceans.</p><p>Like all storm petrels, Wilson’s Storm Petrels have an acute sense of smell, which they use to help locate productive feeding areas. They are strongly attracted by fish oils, but also by dimethyl sulphide, a compound released when phytoplankton are grazed by zooplankton or small fish. They are also attracted to ships, following for hours, and accumulate at stationary or slow-moving vessels. During oceanographic cruises, you might see no storm petrels at all until the ship stops to lower a device into the water, but thereafter they start to gather, and within an hour or so, there might be 10-20 foraging behind the vessel. On one memorable occasion I came across a dead Sperm Whale floating at sea which was accompanied, among other birds, by hundreds of Wilson’s Storm Petrels. In the old days of land-based whaling stations, they even came ashore to feed directly on the fat oozing out of the whale carcasses. Most prey are taken by surface-dipping, grabbing prey located near the surface with the bill. However, they sometimes make shallow plunge dives, submerging for a few seconds. They also land on the water next to larger prey items, trying to tear off bite-sized chunks with their rather soft bills, using their raised wings to gain extra leverage.</p><p>They breed in rocky crevices, often among loose slopes, using feathers to line the nest cavity. They are nocturnal at the northern colonies, arriving and departing after dark to reduce the risk of predation by skuas. Here again their sense of smell assists with finding their own burrows. However, their southern breeding sites experience 24 hours of daylight in midsummer, leaving the birds no option but to run the gauntlet of skuas as they commute to and from their colonies. They recall Little Swifts as they fly around nunataks in Antarctica more than 100 km inland from the edge of the ice shelf.</p><p>Introduced predators have reduced breeding populations at some locations, but with a total population of several million breeding pairs, Wilson’s Storm Petrels are not globally threatened.</p>",

The flight can be very fast, especially when a pair is interacting, but they quickly return to a favoured rock or tree stump on which to perch until their restless nature takes them for another flight. They often fly very low over the water, apparently hunting small insects hatching from the surface.</p><p>This bird is essentially a tropical species of moister areas extending southwards to about Durban on the east coast but may also be found far west along the Kunene River almost to the Atlantic Ocean. But even in the moist east it is absent from large areas of drier habitat such as that found in southern Mozambique. It is rare away from its normal area of distribution. Man and his inroads on the environment have, in many cases, benefited this and other swallow species. The creation of dams, bridges and even houses near water have provided increased habitat and nesting sites. The sighting of an adult male in a reed bed next to a dam just west of Port Alfred in June 1994 was an unexpected surprise.

For instance, on the Zambezi, where it is common for much of the year, it almost completely disappears during the wet summer months, possibly moving downstream to the low-lying areas of coastal Mozambique. There is no mention anywhere of flocking behaviour and it is rare that groups are more than just family parties. This makes it difficult to determine to where they may go, especially if there are resident birds in these areas.</p><p>In natural habitat, the mud half-cup nest may be placed under a rock overhang out in the river, in a carved-out hollow in a sandy bank or under a large fallen tree. If not destroyed by flood water, the nest may be reused for several seasons. It has become a regular nester on boats on the upper Zambezi and at Kariba. The adults go along with the boat when it leaves its moorings! The birds spend much time flying in and out of their nest even when it does not hold eggs or young. When holding territory, the male will roost at night sitting on the edge of the cup. The young remain with the adults for some time after fledging, and at night they all sleep together in a tight-knit group. Once re-laying takes place, the young are chased from the territory. Four successive broods within a season have been recorded but this may be exceptional.</p><p>Being a much brighter blue, and with its chestnut cap, it is quite easy to separate from the White-throated Swallow, both when sitting and in flight. The two may sometimes compete for nest sites even though they occasionally nest almost alongside each other. The duller young may be confused with the similarly-sized Pearl-breasted Swallow – this can happen even with birds in the hand.</p>",

They spend our winter either in the Equatorial region or in the northern tropics. To those living in the woodlands where this bird breeds, its arrival is the harbinger of spring thanks to its loud, ringing call. When the birds first return they announce their presence from a high calling post. The call starts with a loud single note ‘tiuu’, followed by a descending trill ‘krit-trrrrrrrrr..’. While calling, the bird opens and closes its wings, displaying its striking blue and black plumage to its best advantage. The birds give the trilling call four to six times in quick succession. They may also call while flying around their territory.</p><p>This is one of the most striking of our woodland kingfishers with its bright blue back, wings and tail, with black shoulders and wing tips. The underparts are a very pale, almost white-grey. The large, long red (upper) and black (lower) bill is conspicuous and is accentuated by the black line running from the base of the bill to the eye.</p><p>This is one of the most striking of our woodland kingfishers with its bright blue back, wings and tail, with black shoulders and wing tips.

The large, long red (upper) and black (lower) bill is conspicuous and is accentuated by the black line running from the base of the bill to the eye.</p><p>This species is a bird of the woodlands, particularly the lower-lying and middle-level woodlands of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and northern Botswana, south, to northern KwaZulu-Natal. It is interesting that while they overfly the Zimbabwean plateau, they do not nest there, but move further south to breed in the Zimbabwe lowveld, South African bushveld and northern KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>Like other terrestrial kingfishers, it spends much of its time sitting quietly on a perch, usually in the shade, watching the ground below for prey. When suitable prey is spotted the bird swoops down next to the prey and grabs it with its bill. They eat a variety of prey, including lizards and snakes, frogs, crabs and small fish, birds and millipedes, but insects are the most important prey.</p><p>Being birds which breed in holes in trees, they must have a suitable nest hole within their territory. For this reason woodlands with acacia, and particularly mopane, are often preferred areas for these birds. Their activities during breeding are centred on an old barbet or woodpecker hole which the pair defends against other birds. If a suitable nest box is put up, they will occupy this – they are thus well known as garden birds in the lowveld.</p><p>They also use natural holes in trees and have even been recorded as nesting in holes in buildings. Like most hole-nesting birds, they lay plain white eggs and the chicks hatch naked and blind. The egg shells are removed from the nest after hatching but are not carried any distance from the nest. Normally the bird bringing food broods the chicks, particularly while they are small. Small chicks are unable to get to the entrance hole so holes become fouled by excreta. After about 10 days, the chicks eject faeces out of the hole. They also regurgitate pellets of the harder, indigestible pieces of insects. The chicks fledge after about 20 days but remain on the territory for at least four to six weeks, begging for food from their parents.  &#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Wood Pipit, sometimes called the Woodland Pipit elsewhere in its African range, was previously considered synonymous with the widespread Long-billed Pipit. Indeed, during the first Southern African Bird Atlas Project the two species were lumped, and the distribution map for the Wood Pipit was subsequently generated by re-assigning all records from woodlands north of the Limpopo to this species. The two differ subtly in their build and plumage, but their distribution ranges are not known to overlap. A belt of unsuitable mopane and Acacia woodland prevents the Wood Pipit from crossing the Limpopo Valley. However, it is not impossible that a small population may exist in the isolated miombo woodland patches in north-eastern South Africa.</p><p>As its name implies, the Wood Pipit is restricted to tree-rich environments and is particularly prevalent in miombo woodlands in Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique, where Msasa (Brachystegia spiciformis) and Munondo (Julbernardia globiflora) trees are dominant. Like all pipits, it forages on the ground, and is therefore restricted to woodland where there is open ground between the trees and a fairly sparse under-storey—typically with 20-30cm high, tussocky grass tufts, interspersed with open soil. Fortunately for birders, this species often forages along vehicle tracks, and prime territories include stretches of road; nests are seldom located more than a couple of metres from the edge of a road.</p><p>As its name implies, the Wood Pipit is restricted to tree-rich environments and is particularly prevalent in miombo woodlands in Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique, where Msasa (Brachystegia spiciformis) and Munondo (Julbernardia globiflora) trees are dominant.

Interestingly, this species is absent from teak woodlands in western Zimbabwe, representing the transition from the Zimbabwean subspecies A. n. frondicolus and the western A. n. chersophilus. North of the Zambezi, two further subspecies occur: a. n. schoutedeni in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo and Gabon, and the nominate A. n. nyassae—named after the old Nyasaland, now Malawi—in Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania.</p><p>Wood Pipits are likely to be encountered singly or in pairs, or less often in small groups. They forage in sparsely vegetated areas with short grass or abundant leaf litter, often concentrating their hunting efforts at the bases of rock outcrops, around fallen branches and logs, on termitaria, along vehicle tracks and in grassy clearings. The diet consists primarily of insects, including ants, wasps, beetles, bugs, cockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers, mantids, moths, termites and other small invertebrates. They frequently join mixed bird parties, particularly in winter.</p><p>If flushed from the woodland floor, this species will immediately seek refuge in a nearby tree, flitting up into the canopy, often with a sharp call. Like the overlapping Striped and Tree Pipits, the Wood Pipit appears confident in trees, and sometimes walks along the lengths of the branches. The song, also delivered from a tree canopy, is very similar to those of other larger pipits: a slow, structured repetition of sparrow-like notes.</p><p>Despite their semi-arboreal habits, Wood Pipits breed on the ground. The nest is a smallish cup constructed of dry grass and other strips of vegetation, with a more finely lined inner cup, and is often partly covered by overhanging grass blades. An extension of the nest’s rim is often discernible on the side of the nest from which the birds approach. It is typically placed in a slight depression against the base of a grass tuft, where well hidden. Two to three eggs, with heavy markings often concentrated around the thick end of the egg, are laid at one-day intervals in July to February (mostly September to November). However, the breeding biology of this species is poorly known, and aspects such as the incubation period, fledging period and nesting success rate are currently unknown.</p>",

They winter widely in sub-Saharan Africa through India to south-east Asia and Australia. The birds wintering in Africa are drawn from the population breeding to at least 70°E in western Siberia, and ring recoveries suggest that the birds visiting southern Africa originate from Russia east to 65°E. However, some birds from this area also winter in the Indian subcontinent.</p><p>The total population wintering in Africa is crudely estimated at about three million adults and 1-2 million fledged young of the season. Yet one rarely sees large numbers at any one site as they are spread so thinly and evenly across the continent, avoiding only mountains and deserts. However, densities tend to be lower further south in Africa, and there is some evidence to suggest that birds visiting the extreme south of the range have declined in numbers. The largest concentrations occur on the vast, shallow flood-plains of rivers such as the Nile in Sudan, the Niger in West Africa, and the upper Zambesi and Kafue in Zambia. They are also abundant in rice fields, especially in Guinea-Bissau, and considerable numbers are found in the Equatorial forest zone. The total population visiting southern Africa is roughly estimated at about 125&#160;000 birds, a small fraction of the African total.</p><p>At present there are no threats to the population as a whole, although local decreases have been noted on the breeding grounds due to drainage of wetlands and an increase in forestry in the breeding marshes. Overgrazing and drought due to climate change in the Niger basin has led to declines in the non-breeding population, but these birds apparently have been absorbed elsewhere if the breeding population has remained fairly stable. In southern Africa localised habitat loss resulting from the destruction of marshes has been offset to some extent by the creation of small dams and sewage works.</p>",

When their primary food supply – invertebrates – is evenly but sparsely dispersed in the environment, it makes sense for them to be solitary and spread out. However, where there are isolated outbreaks of army worm, or termite alate emergences, larger numbers gather to feed, and subsequently roost together. Communal roosts may be important ‘information centres’ where these storks obtain clues from conspecifics as to the whereabouts of good feeding grounds. For example, storks which have been feeding on a surfeit of fish and frogs at a drying pool will immediately set off from the roost early the following morning to return to the site, and their purposefulness will be a clear indication to others that they know precisely where they are going. Woolly-necked Storks also feed on reptiles, and are frequently seen attending bush fires, snapping up displaced insects or the charred remains of a lizard or snake. Its light, soaring flight enables it to cover large areas in search of places where food is temporarily abundant. When the storks have satisfied their daily food demands, they like to loaf and preen on sandy riverbanks, often sunning themselves with wings outstretched.</p><p>Within our region, Woolly-necked Storks breed from August to December, but north of our borders, they breed earlier and many of the migrants arriving in November and December are immature birds. It is not clear how the small, isolated southern African breeding population originated, but in view of the fact that it is slowly expanding, like the Black Stork it may have started with overwintering birds which became resident and settled permanently due to the onset of favourable conditions. The Woolly-necked Stork breeds solitarily, like the Black Stork, but in large riparian trees along river courses where it builds a substantial platform nest (the Black Storks mostly nest on cliffs).</p><p>By April, the migrants depart for greener pastures to the north of our borders. They follow recognizable landscape features along traditional routes called flyways, with stopovers for resting and refuelling along the way. These staging points are vital for Woolly-necked and other storks which migrate by day using thermals, and recently there have been international initiatives to identify and protect this network of critical sites. The long-term future of the migratory Woolly-necked Stork population depends on the success of these flyway conservation measures.&#9;</p>",

Small flocks still visit the little garden of our Bvumba shack, but they come and go. There was a time when they were abundant; that was a few years after a very hot fire had devastated the bush-encroached grassland between forest patches and a head-high regrowth of straggling Dodonea shrubs dominated for a few years. The tops of these plants held many waxbills’ nests, but that phase passed as a canopy of more robust growth became established topping out at about three meters, and most of the waxbills have gone.</p><p>Like the South African Swee where the male has a black throat, both species like a forest edge habitat and commonly range into similar vegetation structures in scrub mosaics and gardens.

        "Body_Content": "<p>Oxpeckers have formed a symbiotic relationship with large mammals, and make a highly specialised living by feeding on ticks and other ectoparasites on these mammals. They are related to starlings, some of which, like the Pale-winged Starling, occasionally glean ticks from large mammals, but are now placed in their own family in recognition of their genetic distinctiveness. Engorged ticks may not seem like an appetising food item, but oxpeckers carrying beakfuls of ticks to nestlings appear to salivate profusely!</p><p>The Yellow-billed Oxpecker is well suited to a life on its hosts – primarily buffalo, rhino and giraffe in wildlife areas, and cattle elsewhere – which is to be expected, given its total dependency on them. Its physical adaptations include short legs and sharp claws for clinging to the often sparse fur of its host and a laterally flattened bill which is used in a scissoring motion to comb through fur in search of tick nymphs or mites. The bill is also used for plucking adult ticks and opening wounds on the host in order to obtain additional blood. So at home on their hosts are Yellow-billed Oxpeckers that they often sleep on them at night! This is thought to be a consequence of their dependence on a very narrow range of hosts. However, the relationship is not always peaceful, with the hosts sometimes trying to throw the birds off.</p><p>The Yellow-billed Oxpecker is well suited to a life on its hosts – primarily buffalo, rhino and giraffe in wildlife areas, and cattle elsewhere – which is to be expected, given its total dependency on them.

However, the relationship is not always peaceful, with the hosts sometimes trying to throw the birds off.</p><p>Like starlings, Yellow-billed Oxpeckers nest in natural tree holes, and it should come as no surprise that their nests are lined with mammal hair plucked from the hosts. An interesting feature of their nesting is that the adults sometimes are assisted with chick feeding by one or two helpers – at least some pairs are co-operative breeders.</p><p>Highly specialised birds with very narrow ecological niches run the risk of population declines if circumstances change, and this applies to the Yellow-billed Oxpecker. Increasing hunting pressure on their mammal hosts during the 19th century, followed by the rinderpest epidemic, impacted negatively on the oxpeckers. The subsequent use of arsenical compounds in cattle dips decimated the remaining populations. Their range shrank to the large game areas of northern Namibia (Zambezi Region), northern Botswana and western, southern and south-eastern Zimbabwe. By 1915, the Yellow-billed Oxpecker was extinct as a breeding species in South Africa. Fortunately concerned conservationists launched re-introduction efforts. In 1975, Bill Howells caught 47 Yellow-billed Oxpeckers in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and translocated them to the Rhodes Matobos National Park where they thrived. This pioneering effort was not without challenges – most notably, how to catch oxpeckers? Both ingenuity and patience are required. Donkeys were fitted with blankets covered with numerous small nylon nooses (up to 1&#160;000 per animal) and these live ‘traps’ proved successful. Due to the birds’ habit of picking at wounds on their mammalian hosts, it was found that they take readily to a mixture of mincemeat and blood, and so their natural diet was supplemented in this way during capture and translocation. One of the most interesting aspects of oxpecker release was the importance of suitable nest sites and also hollow logs for roosting. If these are not available, the birds disperse.</p><p>Yellow-billed Oxpeckers were also moved from Zambezi Region in Namibia to the iMfolozi section of the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in South Africa. Despite doing well initially, this population has dwindled over the years. Generally, though, the oxpeckers have been willing participants in the re-introduction process – in 1979 they recolonised the northern part of the Kruger Park, crossing a 50-kilometre strip of communal land from Gonarezhou National Park in south-eastern Zimbabwe thanks to the disruption of government cattle-dipping programmes by the bush war. They have spread steadily southwards in Kruger Park, showing that populations soon recover once threats to bird populations are addressed.</p>",

Their appearance is especially striking when they associate with Southern Red Bishops, and the two species can be seen together regularly at times. At some localities Yellow-crowned Bishops are present throughout the year, and breed predictably at the same sites, yet elsewhere they appear to arrive to take advantage of temporarily favourable conditions, and then disappear again. Thus on a farm north of Bloemfontein, Yellow-crowned Bishops nested in grasses in a shallow flooded pan in one year; the owners had not seen this species on the farm before. The following year the pan was dry and the birds were absent, but two years later when it was flooded once more, the bishops returned and nested. In the non-breeding season, Yellow-crowned Bishops join large mixed flocks of other seedeaters, and are then difficult to separate from other small bishops; the broad yellow eyebrow and whitish belly with narrow streaks are the best clues. Males probably only moult into breeding plumage in their second year, as in other bishops. There is little information on the survival or movements of individual wild birds; in captivity birds have survived up to 15 years.</p><p>Male Yellow-crowned Bishops are territorial, clustered in small colonies, and they will also exclude Southern Red Bishops from their territories. They are polygynous, building several nest frames within the territory. In flight, with all the body feathers erected, they approach any intruders to their territory, while singing a staccato song. Males will be chased off. If the visitor is a potential mate, and then lands within the territory, perched courtship will follow. In this display the yellow back is often turned towards the female, and the male may flutter his wings. Males will also sing from perches in the territory at other times. Although in superficial appearance the Yellow-crowned Bishop seems a mere colour variant on the various red-and-black bishops, molecular data indicate that this species is an offshoot at the base of the Euplectes family tree, so closer to the common ancestor of both the bishops and widowbirds rather than a member of either of these two groups.</p><p>Male Yellow-crowned Bishops are territorial, clustered in small colonies, and they will also exclude Southern Red Bishops from their territories.

The male weaves the nest frame, though in some cases females have been seen to participate at this stage; as in all bishop nests, there is a side entrance, but this is often concealed under a bower of living grass which is woven into the nest structure. Once a female has accepted a nest, she adds a grass lining and may continue to bring in material during incubation, so that it protrudes from the nest entrance. While both incubation and feeding of the nestlings are normally done by the female alone, there is a record of a male feeding nestlings in captivity.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Yellow-fronted Canary is one of our smallest canaries. Unlike some members of this family, typically inhabitants of drier areas, the female is not markedly different to the male, just duller in appearance. It shares the distinctive bright yellow rump and white tip to the tail, features readily apparent when flushed from the ground, with the two other most similar species in the region, the Black-throated and Lemon-breasted canaries. These two species are otherwise much less colourful in overall appearance though. The taxonomy of the canary-like birds of Africa and Eurasia is still very much in flux, and these three canaries may not necessarily be one another’s closest relatives. The song of the male is typical of the family, a protracted and musical, if not particularly distinct, twittering that includes mimicry of other species.</p><p>The distribution of the Yellow-fronted Canary comprises the moist eastern half of the subcontinent. Within its range, it occurs virtually wherever there is some tree cover, including areas with alien trees and parks and gardens. It is not a true forest dweller though. Its range completely overlaps that of the Lemon-breasted Canary, and the two are often found side by side. The Black-throated Canary largely replaces its Yellow-fronted counterpart in the drier western reaches of southern Africa but the two have a broad area of overlap, especially in the northern parts of the region. The Yellow-fronted Canary, like most seedeaters, is mobile in its habits but there is little evidence for true long-distance migrations. The furthest ringing recovery is 35 km. It is one of the most commonly recorded birds within its range, and is typically a familiar and reassuring sight and sound wherever it is found.</p><p>The distribution of the Yellow-fronted Canary comprises the moist eastern half of the subcontinent.

It will also take some insects, especially when breeding. This canary is a common visitor to seed-dispensing bird feeders in suburban gardens throughout its range. Although it habitually sings from the tops of the tallest trees, it forages equally as characteristically on, or close to, the ground. The attraction of this bird to gardens, especially those that provide artificial food, coupled with its ground-feeding habits, explain why it regularly falls prey to domestic cats. Other, more natural, predators are known to include raptors, bush-shrikes and snakes.</p><p>As with several other canaries, for example the Cape Canary, nesting can sometimes be semi-colonial, with simultaneously active nests in adjacent trees. This aspect of breeding in canaries is worthy of more detailed investigation. The nest is a tiny, deep cup painstakingly constructed from strips of plant matter and lined with finer material. Spider web is employed to bind it into position. The typical clutch size is 3-4 eggs, which are whitish with brownish markings concentrated at the thick end. Nest-building is largely, and incubation solely, by the female. The male more than makes up for this tardiness, though, by feeding the female during incubation, and both the female and the young during the early nestling period. In the later nestling period both adults feed the young.</p><p>This attractive canary has proved popular in the cage-bird industry and large-scale trapping in our region has been reported from at least Mozambique and Botswana in recent times. It is particularly disconcerting that some 2.6 million wild-caught birds have been detected in the global trade since 1985. The species is not considered formally threatened, though. Its popularity as a cage bird explains introduced feral populations having established themselves in places as far flung as Mauritius, Réunion, Seychelles, Taiwan and Puerto Rico, and other parts of the United States.</p>",

Visiting American or Canadian birders will be impressed by its similarity in size and appearance to the Eastern and Western Meadowlarks Sturnella magna/neglecta of North America, but the longclaw lacks the singing virtuosity of the meadowlark, and is in an entirely different family.</p><p>The elongated hind-toe claw from which the longclaw takes its name averages some 21 mm in length, and it does, of course, serve a function.

They feed in short grass grazed by game or cattle, and regularly associate with cattle to catch grasshoppers and other insects disturbed by the animals grazing activities. Yellow-throated Longclaws occasionally forage on burnt grass areas such as firebreaks, where they are never far from the cover of unburned grass. In addition to mantids and grasshoppers, they also consume caterpillars and winged moths, small molluscs, and ants. Flying termite alates appear irresistible, and longclaws fly up from the grass to hawk such delectable items.</p><p>As the summer breeding season approaches, male Yellow-throated Longclaws commence calling from their favourite song posts, such as low bushes, termite mounds or fence-pole tops. This continues for several weeks before nest-building activity gets under way. The ardour of some males is such that they start calling half an hour before dawn, particularly when there is a bright moon in the sky. Males also engage in noisy, fluttering display flights, making a slow ascent with widespread tail and loud calls, often in a circular direction, before coming to ground again.</p><p>Predator awareness increases in the breeding season, and longclaws track the movements of a mongoose through the grassland by fluttering above it. If a nest or fledglings are under threat from a terrestrial predator such as a mongoose or cat, they initiate convincing distraction displays, either flying weakly no more than half a metre above long grass, or fluttering, seemingly injured, through short grass. The nest is normally placed on the ground at the base of a grass tussock and under the overhang of grass stems, or at the base of a shrub or protruding object such as a large stone or termite mound. Nests sited near vleis or ephemeral pans tend to be built above ground level in tall grass tussocks or shrubs, perhaps to minimise risk of flooding in the event of rising water levels.</p>",

There are also a variety of other calls given by this species, but they are less discernible than the typical chirping call.</p><p>The birds occur in a variety of open savanna woodlands from acacia to miombo and are typically found where there is little or no ground cover. They become habitu&#173;ated to farm gardens very quickly and may become one of the commoner garden birds at farmsteads. I have found this to be particularly true where nest boxes of suitable size are put up in farm gardens. They nested in our garden at Peterhouse in a nest box for nine consecutive years - not the same birds, but the same species.</p><p>The birds feed on the ground and are usually seen in pairs or small parties. However, where food is available they may gather in much larger numbers. Where other grain-eating birds occur, they may join them in mixed-species flocks to feed on grain in open areas. However, my observations have been that this species tends to eat a lot more insects than other sparrows. In fact, my observations at the nest revealed that they invariably brought insects to the chicks. In the Brachystegia Woodland they often joined other bird parties and here they moved, not on the ground, but in the upper reaches of the trees, where they worked their way along branches or leaves searching for insects. They are known as nectar gatherers at a variety of aloe species and would appear to make extensive use of the Weeping Boer-bean Schotia brachypetala trees when these were in flower. The copious nectar produced enabled the sparrows to access it easily.</p><p>The Yellow-throated Sparrow occurs widely across the eastern half of southern Africa and westwards along the northern parts of Botswana wherever suitable open woodland occurs. They can be very common in some areas but are usually overlooked because of their drab colouring and quiet nature.</p><p>The birds are hole nesters and very often made use of old woodpecker holes. They made extensive use of nest boxes with an entrance-hole diameter of 50&#160;mm that we put up in the Peterhouse conservation area at Gosho Park near Marondera. They build a pad of soft material at the bottom of the hole on which two or three eggs are laid. The incubation appears to be done by the female and the male brings food to her at the nest. Once the chicks are more than seven or eight days old, the female leaves the nest and helps the male to provision the chicks. At this time the birds need to feed insects to the chicks at five- to ten-minute intervals almost throughout the day. Once the chicks are about twelve or thirteen days old they are able to scramble up to the entrance of the nest and reach out to be fed by the adult bringing food. The chicks leave the nest when fully feathered and normally stay with the adults for some weeks after fledging.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Yellow-bellied Eremomelas have a wide distribution in Africa, ranging from southern Mauritania east to Sudan and south to South Africa, but are absent from the forested areas of west and central Africa. Their distribution in southern Africa is almost throughout the semi-arid and arid regions, but not in the hyperarid Namib Desert. Other gaps in the southern African distribution are the central highlands around Gauteng and western Swaziland, and coastal lowlands in Mozambique and almost all of KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho. There is a small patch where the birds occur in the eastern parts of the Eastern Cape Province. They are present throughout the Karoo and Little Karoo but do not cross the southern and easternmost Southern Fold Mountains in the Western Cape Province, and are scarce south of Cape Columbine in west coast strandveld.</p><p>Yellow-bellied Eremomelas occupy the shrub layer of a range of dry habitats, including savanna, arid and semi-arid shrublands and sparse shrublands on rocky hillsides. Although this species is recorded from woodlands, they are found only where there is shrubby vegetation. In south-eastern Zimbabwe the birds occur in acacia woodlands, because the acacia is an early coloniser of degraded habitat, creating the shrubby vegetation that this species needs. However, they are absent from acacia woodlands at Nylsvley, Limpopo Province, possibly because of competition from other small insectivorous birds. Areas cleared of woodland, along roads for example, where shrubs and small trees have colonised the open ground, provide typical habitat for this species. They also occur in grassland with scattered bushes.</p><p>Yellow-bellied Eremomelas occupy the shrub layer of a range of dry habitats, including savanna, arid and semi-arid shrublands and sparse shrublands on rocky hillsides.

Areas cleared of woodland, along roads for example, where shrubs and small trees have colonised the open ground, provide typical habitat for this species. They also occur in grassland with scattered bushes.</p><p>In the Karoo the birds forage mainly in Sweet Thorn Acacia karroo tree lines along (usually dry) drainage lines, wandering into adjacent shrubby vegetation such as Succulent Karoo and karroid broken veld. Yellow-bellied Eremomelas occur in gardens in Prince Albert in the southern Karoo and in gardens elsewhere in their southern African distribution range, suggesting that the birds can tolerate some transformation of their habitat. They are resident in most parts of their southern African range, but nomadic, or locally nomadic, in the more arid parts. Some seasonal movements have been recorded, mostly local movements to lower altitudes, or moving from mixed woodland into miombo woodland in winter.</p><p>The birds are fairly common, usually solitary, sometimes in pairs or small groups. They typically are very active, moving restlessly through the vegetation, and often appear shy and nervous, although they can be quite confiding, giving good views of their activities. They forage by searching among twigs and foliage, working from bottom to top of bushes and saplings, mostly gleaning from leaves and less often gleaning from twigs. They frequently join mixed-species bird parties. Their food is mainly small invertebrates, and includes bugs (Homoptera), small beetles, larvae (caterpillars) of butterflies and moths, termites, ants, fruits, seeds and nectar of aloes.</p><p>Yellow-bellied Eremomelas are monogamous, solitary nesters, and probably are territorial. A nest found recently was typical – a very neat, thin-walled cup, slung between horizontal twigs inside a Karoo Gold bush Rhigozum obovatum in shrubland next to a small patch of Sweet Thorn trees. Nests may be in the inner or outer (usually in the outer) branches of a shrub or sapling in savannas and are often clearly visible from a distance. Nests are normally inside shrubs in the Karoo, and usually about one metre above ground level. The nest itself is built of dry grass and silky plant fibres, such as the silky bark from Lammerlat Gomphocarpus filifolius shrubs in the Karoo, and bound with spider web. Incubation of the eggs is probably by both sexes and both parents feed the nestlings. The young remain under parental care for two weeks or so after leaving the nest.&#9;</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>There are over 60 species of the bulbul family in sub-Saharan Africa, most of which are confined to the Equatorial forests. This greenbul is one of a comparatively few of the tropical contingent that range south of the Zambezi River, and it extends as far as the southern border of KwaZulu-Natal. It occurs in a large variety of habitats, from the coastal forests and mangroves to riverine bush and thickets to well-developed miombo and mopane woodland.</p><p>The Yellow-bellied Greenbul often skulks in dense thickets. The late Gordon Mac&#173;lean, author of the 5th and 6th editions of Roberts’ Birds of southern Africa, commented that the only time this bird emerges from the forest is on cold winter mornings in order to warm itself in the sun. When its usual haunts include somebody’s garden, however, it can become habituated to people and be reasonably confiding, especially if there is a birdbath available, because these birds are regular bathers.</p><p>The Yellow-bellied Greenbul often skulks in dense thickets.

When its usual haunts include somebody’s garden, however, it can become habituated to people and be reasonably confiding, especially if there is a birdbath available, because these birds are regular bathers.</p><p>Seen or unseen, its nasal ‘dweh-dweh-dweh-dweh-dweh’ call is one of the characteristic sounds of warm forests and woodlands. It commonly occurs in pairs or small groups of up to five birds, and is very much a stay-at-home species. For example, a Yellow-bellied Greenbul caught and ringed in the Twinstreams forest at Mtunzini was retrapped 24 times in the following 11&#160;years. Like its tropical greenbul relatives, this species is relatively long-lived; the oldest surviving ringed individual was still alive at over 12 years of age, and is on record only because it could not resist strawberries and could not find its way out from under the wire netting covering a strawberry bed in a Zimbabwe farmstead garden.</p><p>In forest habitats this greenbul usually forages in the undergrowth, mid-strata, fringe areas and occasionally the canopy, gleaning leaves and twigs in its search for insects and small fruits. It hawks flying termites in clearings, and is prone to join with mixed foraging flocks in the dry season. It sometimes forms mixed-species flocks with Terrestrial Brownbuls and Yellow-streaked Greenbuls, and all three species forage together without dispute or signs of aggression.</p><p>Yellow-bellied Greenbuls demonstrate a different type of foraging association when they glean antelopes for ectoparasites, much like oxpeckers do. This usually happens in forest-woodland mosaics, and the list of animals includes Red Duiker, Nyala, Impala, Grey Duiker and Klipspringer. The bird usually goes to the head of the animal and examines ears and nostrils, places where ticks often attach themselves. In the case of Klipspringers observed at Matobo in Zimbabwe it appeared that the birds were pecking at the antelopes’ pre-orbital glands, and it was surmised that they might be seeking glandular secretions. In virtually all of the observations the antelope tolerated, or at least ignored the attentions of the greenbul (and of other birds observed gleaning), indicating that such associations are not uncommon, albeit not often observed because of the restricted visibility of forest environments and the wariness of the antelopes to human approach.</p><p>Yellow-bellied Greenbuls pair off in the breeding season and take about a week to build a rather flimsy nest of tendrils and rootlets, through which the two eggs can sometimes be seen from below. After the chicks hatch they are initially fed largely on insects, but increasingly (as they get older) with small drupes and berries. When the nestlings are ready to fledge, the parents entice them from the nest by perching close by and offering fruit, perhaps (for a fortunate few) even portions of strawberries.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>This species is readily identified by its bright yellow bill which contrasts with its speckled brown head. The bird has a scaly or wavy appearance because of the pale-coloured edges of the feathers, hence the specific name undulata, meaning ‘wave-like’. In flight they reveal a bright metallic green speculum edged with white, both in front of and behind the green. They are fast-flying ducks which are able to rise straight from the water and seem to reach full speed almost immediately.</p><p>The Yellow-billed Duck is common in South Africa but is comparatively rare in Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Botswana outside the Okavango system. Outside of our region it extends northwards to Ethiopia. It is normally found in areas with plenty of open water, especially wetlands with at least some emergent vegetation, and because it is a strong flier, may appear almost anywhere in southern Africa, following heavy rains which fill up temporary pans. Unlike the African Black Duck, it avoids fast-flowing rivers. Fresh water is preferred to saline or brackish pans, especially the new water in seasonally flooded vleis and pans. Permanent wetlands with open shallow water and short, emergent vegetation are also favoured.</p><p>The Yellow-billed Duck is common in South Africa but is comparatively rare in Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Botswana outside the Okavango system.

Permanent wetlands with open shallow water and short, emergent vegetation are also favoured.</p><p>These ducks have benefited tremendously from irrigation schemes where they can be found in open dams and even along many of the ditches which have been dug to move water, provided that the water is not fast-flowing. They do not gather in large numbers to plunder crops so they are not under threat by farmers.</p><p>They feed by swimming with the head immersed, using the beak to sift out food, which consists largely of vegetation (over 80%), especially Sago Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus, and some invertebrates. They sometimes upend to reach soft mud on the floor of a pan, and even dive and swim under water. They often pluck the green shoots on emergent plants as well.</p><p>I have noticed that in the southern Cape this is another of those species which starts breeding quickly once natural pans fill up, following heavy rains. In 2011 we witnessed the first groups of Yellow-billed Ducks with ducklings within six weeks after Voëlvlei had first filled up, even before the emergent vegetation was tall enough to sufficiently hide the ducklings. At the first hint of danger the ducklings would dive underwater for cover! The adult, presumably the female, as she does all the incubation and care of the ducklings, would do a broken-wing act as we approachedin an effort to draw us away from where the ducklings were hiding.</p><p>The nest is usually placed within 20 metres of water in dense vegetation such as grass or sedges which screen the nest from above, and if the grass cover is extensive, there may be a short tunnel through the grass to the nest. The female will build the nest under a thorn bush if one is available. The nest bowl is lined with grass or other dry vegetation to which many downy feathers are added. More feathers are added as incubation proceeds so that the eggs are covered when the female is absent from the nest. In damp situations the base of the nest will be much thicker than those nests on dry ground. I have found that the female will sometimes sit very tight and allow one to get within five metres of the nest before she slips off and goes to the water, making no attempt to fly away. The females are known to hybridise with feral Mallard males, which may pose a threat to long-term genetic integrity, but so far the degree of mixing is not large.</p>",

In its case the deeply-forked tail is the giveaway to its identity, a tail that is used vigorously in flight, canting to the left and right, fanning and closing, and generally steering the bird as it doubles back on itself or twists and swoops to scoop up a food item from the ground. Its frequenting of motorways is no accident: it is here to scavenge the carcasses of small mammals and birds killed by vehicles, and it has remarkable aerial manoeuvrability, being able to snatch these up comfortably in the face of oncoming traffic. However, the many road-kill specimens of this bird brought to museums bear mute testimony to the risks associated with such scavenging.</p><p>Yellow-billed Kites also frequent rural settlements and the edges of cities and towns, and they are much attracted to refuse dumps and to shorelines of lakes and estuaries where fishermen may have left behind fish entrails or bait. They also frequently hang around camps and picnic sites in game parks, and many people who stop for a sandwich or settle down for a braai or picnic will have experienced their piracy. This piracy extends to robbing other birds such as kingfishers, storks, and even African Fish Eagles, of prey they have caught, doing this by harassing the victim to such an extent that it drops the prey only to have it snatched away in a flash. A great variety of live prey is also caught, from insects, frogs and crabs to rodents, small birds and fish. In short, they are remarkably versatile predators.</p><p>Yellow-billed Kites also frequent rural settlements and the edges of cities and towns, and they are much attracted to refuse dumps and to shorelines of lakes and estuaries where fishermen may have left behind fish entrails or bait.

These northern birds go by the name of Milvus aegyptius aegyptius while those in southern Africa are Milvus aegyptius parasitus. Its all-yellow bill is one of the main features to look for in distinguishing the Yellow-billed Kite from the Black Kite, at least in adult birds, and it has a more deeply forked tail and a uniformly brown head.</p><p>Yellow-billed Kites are breeding migrants to southern Africa whereas Black Kites are non-breeding visitors. As a result most of the Yellow-billed Kites one sees are dispersed as pairs, with flocking and gregarious behaviour being the exception rather than the rule; termite alate hatchings are one such exception when dozens of these kites may gather to prey on the flying insects. They arrive in southern Africa in August, a few months before the Black Kites, and by the time the latter reach here their breeding cycle is well under way. Pairs often return to the same nest each year, and both sexes refurbish it, or build a new nest at a nearby site. It is a platform of sticks placed in the upper branches of a tree and is characterised by having a few pieces of dry dung, some rags or animal skin added to the nest lining. The usual clutch comprises two eggs, and incubation, lasting about 37 days, is undertaken mainly by the female with short spells by the male. Nesting pairs are unobtrusive and easily overlooked in the vicinity of the nest but they often behave aggressively, swooping at a would-be intruder who approaches their nest. There is no reported cainism in this species and both nestlings are usually raised, the fledging period lasting 42-45 days.</p>",

The annual flood pulse brings life to this wetland, and as the waters recede and floodplains dry out towards the end of winter, fish are trapped, providing a regular bounty for the storks.</p><p>A Yellow-billed Stork, legs dangling, drops from the sky to join the throng of birds at one of these fish traps. Soon it has found a good fishing spot adjacent to a group of pelicans which are herding the fish into the shallows; here the stork waits patiently, bill immersed and slightly open, for an unwary fish or frog to swim by. The water is murky from the frenzied activity of hundreds of fishing birds, but the stork has its own strategy to cope with this; its bill is intensely sensitive to the slightest touch, and its reactions lightning fast. Soon it has snapped up two fish, a frog and a water scorpion. As the pelicans move on, the stork resorts to ‘foot-stirring’ as it advances slowly through the shallows – frightening prey towards the poised bill with the same deadly result. Satisfied, it turns to face into the light breeze, and after a short run with wings flapping, it is aloft and gaining altitude.</p><p>A Yellow-billed Stork, legs dangling, drops from the sky to join the throng of birds at one of these fish traps.

Soon large lagoons with Water Fig islands come into view, and large numbers of birds can be seen below, not feeding, but breeding. The famous lagoons of Xakanaxa, Gadikwe and Gcobega have been used for decades by nesting Yellow-billed Storks, and according to Peter Steyn in his book Nesting Birds constitute the most important breeding site for this species in southern Africa (the Okavango is one of only two regularly used sites, the other being in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa). ‘Our’ bird homes in directly onto its untidy twig-platform nest where its mate is shading three, small, downy chicks. After a brief ritualised nest-changeover ceremony with much bill-clattering, it regurgitates a heap of food onto the nest. Among this seemingly unappetising mess are some fish larger than the chicks themselves! The youngsters tuck in with gusto, and manage to swallow seemingly impossibly large fish, sometimes taking several minutes to do so.</p><p>The adult stands on the nest, preening; around it are other pairs in various stages of courtship, nest construction, incubation and chick-raising. Those still in the earlier phases of breeding are in the pink of condition, and in fact have a subtle pink hue to their wings and back. They also have bright red, naked facial skin, dusted with a light covering of ‘powder-down’ from the feathers. Those storks which are especially keen to impress their mates are flying in with oversized twigs and cumbersome cargoes of whole plants – these are roughly fashioned into functional nests in little over a week. Other adults are commuting regularly between the fish traps and the breeding site, and the timing of breeding is immaculate – even the chicks when they fledge (in just under two months) will have easy pickings while the floodplains continue to dry. Initially they will return to the nest site regularly, but gradually they will move further and further afield, and with other immatures, will populate the wetlands, rivers, marshes and dams of the mesic eastern part of the southern African subregion. This formula clearly works well as the numbers and wide distribution testify. However, the Achilles’ heel for this species is the paucity of regular breeding sites, and this highlights the vital importance of our precious wetlands for the long-term survival of other storks and waterbirds.</p>",

Western Cape birds are the largest, with massive bills in birds from the West Coast, black upper mandibles and white lower mandibles, and brown wings. There have been no comparative studies of the diet in different regions, so it is not clear why these birds should have such heavy bills compared to Yellow Bishops elsewhere. From the Eastern Cape through Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal to Gauteng, male Yellow Bishops are smaller, and their bills are completely black; they also have brown remiges. Then male birds from the highland plateau of the Limpopo province, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have black remiges, and bills with black upper mandibles, white to blue-grey lower mandibles. To date no-one has investigated possible behavioural or genetic differences between these subspecies.</p><p>Based on the male breeding plumage, there are three distinctive populations in our region.

Males first come into breeding plumage in their second year, and the few recaptures have been within 20 km of the original ringing site, with the oldest individual more than nine years old.</p><p>Like other members of its genus, the Yellow Bishop is polygynous, with up to three females nesting at the same time within the male’s territory. Territories are usually well separated, and male Yellow Bishops may even show territorial behaviour towards other species. Males have a fluffed flight display with the yellow feathers of the back prominently erected, then in perched courtship the feathers of the breast are ruffled to the extent that a strip of white is exposed in the midline, showing the pale feather bases. The male has a buzzy song in flight, with more varied notes when perched.</p><p>The male builds the basic nest frame, which is then lined and reinforced by the female. Nests are placed low in the vegetation, supported by vertical stalks, with a side entrance, and often have living plants woven into the structure. Males regularly nip off the tops of plants in the vicinity of the nest. The female is entirely responsible for incubation and feeding the nestlings, and is reportedly liable to desert if the nest is disturbed. Breeding success appears to be low, with many nests destroyed by predators, so females may regularly attempt a second brood. The birds are reportedly aggressive towards Dideric Cuckoos, and there is one possible record of parasitism by this cuckoo.</p>",

It is near-endemic to the subregion, extending marginally into the southern lowlands of Angola. It has been introduced to the Atlantic Ocean islands of Ascension and St Helena, where it has flourished.</p><p>The male could be confused with a Brimstone Canary but the latter is larger and more thickset, with a much heavier bill. Male Yellow Canaries are usually accompanied by the dull and heavily streaked females, making identification easier (female Brimstone Canaries resemble the males). Furthermore, Brimstone Canaries tend to choose taller, more luxuriant vegetation, and the Yellow Canary is most often encountered in low scrub, but the two species are occasionally found side by side, especially along the southern coastal belt of the Western Cape.</p><p>The male could be confused with a Brimstone Canary but the latter is larger and more thickset, with a much heavier bill.

Furthermore, Brimstone Canaries tend to choose taller, more luxuriant vegetation, and the Yellow Canary is most often encountered in low scrub, but the two species are occasionally found side by side, especially along the southern coastal belt of the Western Cape.</p><p>The Yellow Canary occurs in a wide range of habitats, from the relatively lush vegetation bordering the forests on the Amatole Mountains in the Eastern Cape to the arid, dwarf shrublands of the Richtersveld and the adjacent plains of southern Namibia. At times it is abundant in the strandveld vegetation on the west coast of the Western Cape where it tolerates stands of alien Port Jackson Acacia saligna and Rooikrans A. cyclops. It is one of many species that regularly feed in the intertidal zone, especially on beaches that are littered with seaweed. It is often the most common bird at coastal salt marshes and, on the Agulhas Plain, is a regular visitor to the endangered Cape Lowland Alluvial Vegetation that still survives along drainage lines.</p><p>It is largely resident and there is no evidence of large-scale migration. However, as with many bird species occurring in arid regions, there appears to be much local movement, and it moves away from areas where surface water is not readily available. Near the small Overberg settlement of Teslaarsdal it can be common at times but then inexplicably disappears for weeks or months.</p><p>Nests are well spaced, and Yellow Canaries are more territorial than many other canary species. The nest, which is often quite exposed, is most frequently placed in a small bush, sometimes almost on the ground but at other times towards the top of the bush. Occasionally, a small tree is chosen and, exceptionally, the nest may be as high as three metres off the ground. The female, who does all the incubating, can sit very tight and be very reluctant to flush. During the incubating period the male perches prominently nearby, singing for long periods. In the winter rainfall region, where the rains are fairly predictable, nest-building can begin as early as July, with most breeding activity completed by November. In more arid areas breeding is more opportunistic, being geared to coincide with the infrequent rains. In such situations, breeding can occur in any month.</p><p>Numbers of Yellow Canaries have declined in the southern coastal belt of the Western Cape, largely due to the planting of cereal crops and the resulting dearth of natural scrub. Another factor that has adversely affected its numbers is the removal of roadside vegetation. The narrow belt of scrub along rural roads is an important habitat and is often the only suitable vegetation available for nesting.</p><p>Due to its bright yellow plumage (in the male) and its melodic song, this lovely canary is a popular cage bird. Nevertheless, it is a common and widespread bird, and trapping for the pet trade is unlikely to pose a serious threat to its numbers.</p>",

It is a small bird of the Miombo and other woodlands found in these areas, and it may be very common in any well-developed woodland. It is small enough to escape detection were it not for its loud pinging call, which is said to resemble the sound of a hammer hitting an anvil. The call is made at a slower cadence than that of the Red-fronted Tinkerbird, and is such that sometimes one is inclined to wish that birds did not call!  It will call incessantly (one bird I timed for at least ten minutes) and when one has just got used to the pinging background sound, it will stop; one has no sooner got used to the silence and the bird starts calling again! This may happen throughout the day.</p><p>This species is a regular member of the mixed-species bird parties of the Miombo Woodlands, through late summer and autumn, into late winter. However, it would appear that the birds are territorial throughout the year, and in fact the pair joins the bird party as it goes through its territory, leaving the bird party when another pair in the next territory joins the party. Occasionally you do get more than two birds but this may well be a pair of tinkerbirds, plus their chicks of the previous season. Alternatively, these may be non-breeding floaters (birds which do not hold territory). The birds forage through the canopy and even up and down branches, but at this time of the year they are not noisy and, therefore, can be easily overlooked. They will feed on fruit, insects, and what appears to be anything else that is edible.</p><p>This species is a regular member of the mixed-species bird parties of the Miombo Woodlands, through late summer and autumn, into late winter.

The diameter of the hole varies in size between that of a R2 and R5 coin. It is often so shallow that one can reach the bottom of the nest hole with a finger. The nest is much larger inside, the chamber where the eggs are laid being as much as 100 m in diameter. They usually choose trees with softer wood, like the Ficus sp.</p><p>During the nesting season the male seems to call almost incessantly throughout the day, and one can very often locate the nest just by listening from whence the male is calling. I have recorded nests as low as 50 cm from the ground, in a pole holding a trellis in our garden, and as high as 15 m above the ground, and anywhere in between. The birds are preyed upon by boomslangs, and I have on a number of occasions watched a boomslang extract the chicks from the nest while the desperate parents pecked at the body of the snake, but to no effect. It is interesting that this is one of a number of species of birds which feeds its chicks the dried-out white rings from the exo-skeleton of the millipede. This would not appear to have much nutritional value but perhaps they contain something which is necessary for the chicks’ development.</p><p>The chicks are fed fruit, especially the fruit of the mistletoe family. They are also brought wild figs; those with fruit less than 10 mm in diameter. &#9;</p>",

This species may also move out into the surrounding moist woodlands near forests but it would appear that it is essentially a forest bird. Like the other tinkerbirds, it has a loud pinging call but whereas the others call continuously, this species has an interrupted call. The bird may call three or four times and then break, and then repeat the call five or six times and then break, and so on, so that the call is quite different to any of the other tinkerbirds. The call is obviously designed to advertise the presence of the male in his territory, and during the breeding season the birds call almost continuously. At this time the bird is so busy calling and looking out for competitors that it may be approached quite closely and observed while it is calling.</p><p>These birds are recorded as having a rather unusual feeding strategy in fruiting fig trees. While most birds will forage through the trees searching for ripe fruit, this species will sit on a perch and, by moving its head and body around, hunt visually for ripe fruit. If none is seen it moves to another perch and repeats the process.  When a ripe fig is spotted the bird moves forward to the ripe fig and either picks it and swallows it whole if it is one of the smaller figs, or will peck at the ripe fruit, taking mouthfuls from it. Wild figs and mistletoe fruits are high on its list of preferred food items, but it regularly feeds on a range of other small berries and drupes. It varies its fruit diet with insects such as beetles and termites, and can occasionally be seen hawking flying insects. It is also partial to aloe nectar, and individuals whose home range includes stands of flowering aloes such as Aloe marlothii may be seen sporting orange faces (due to dusting with pollen) during the winter months.</p><p>These birds are recorded as having a rather unusual feeding strategy in fruiting fig trees.

The tiny nest hole (about 25 mm in diameter) is excavated in any piece of dead wood, often just a small stump protruding from the side of a tree, and is usually on the underside of an inclined branch. It is presumed that this strategy is designed to help avoid the attention of the Samango Monkeys which inhabit the forests in this area. The Samango Monkeys forage almost exclusively in the forest canopy and seldom come down to the ground except to move from one patch of forest to the next. They appear to be one of the major predators of birds’ nests in these forests and therefore birds nesting near the ground are safer than those nesting in the canopy.  However the tinkerbirds do a lot of foraging in the canopy where there is probably more food for them.&#9;</p>",

Don’t worry about the green being brown or grey and the illustrations being ‘all wrong’, because each one looks different in different lights. Furthermore it is only in the hand that one can see those yellow streaks.</p><p>In Zimbabwe, Yellow-streaked Greenbuls are birds of the inside of evergreen forest but further south they venture into thicket and woodland formations. They do not move in flocks of their own, but they love to join bird parties, and loose family groups seem to keep together. They call to each other as they follow the bird party on its way through the forest. Most of the conversation is of short disjointed ‘jwinks’ and ‘jwanks’ but they often burst into bouts of repeated yelping. Much of the background sound in any bird party comes from these birds.  Phyllastrephus means a ‘leaf-tosser’ and some members of the 12-14 strong genus are very terrestrial, forever fossicking about in the leaf litter on the ground. But this bird does its fossicking on the bigger branches and trunks of the forest trees, and also digs about in clusters of dead leaves and fallen bark that get caught up in the undergrowth before they reach the ground. They are restless, forever moving along but never in a hurry. They hop up the tree trunks, they hang under bunches of moss, they go back to have another look under that piece of loose bark, they stop and look about and never seem to be sure where to go next! Watch for a bit longer and one is sure to see the way that they keep flicking out a wing as they move along to flush insects into moving.</p><p>In Zimbabwe, Yellow-streaked Greenbuls are birds of the inside of evergreen forest but further south they venture into thicket and woodland formations.

They are essentially an insectivorous group of greenbuls eating different arthropods – those creatures that have jointed limbs, a segmented body and a hard exoskeleton – beetles, centipedes, spiders et al. The birds have fairly long, slim beaks and they are not great fruit eaters.</p><p>A further feature of the family is that their nests are generally slung between and below slim divergent or roughly parallel twigs at no great height above ground. The bigger fruit-eating and omnivorous bulbuls prefer more solid support from below, building up from a fork or cluster of criss-crossing branches. Yellow-streaked Bulbuls are notorious for their reluctance to flush off their nests. The bigger bulbuls often grumble and protest at man’s proximity to a nest but these birds make no noise and can often be lifted off their nests. When they do flush they drop down to the ground and then squeal in distress as a distraction. What the greenbuls lack in showy plumage they certainly make up for in the diversity of colour and markings of their eggs. This species lays eggs of various shades of bright pink with a band of intricate scribblings at the obtuse end. Stripe-cheeked Greenbuls lay eggs that are boldly marked in purples and mauves, the Terrestrial Brownbul specialises in greys, the Yellow-bellied Greenbul in olives almost shading into yellow, and the Sombre Greenbul features light browns and greys. Why all these colours?  Why does this bird sit so tight when other members of its genus quickly move off their nests?</p>",

It is more closely related to the Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouse Pterocles exustus of the Sahel and East Africa and the Black-bellied Sandgrouse P. orientalis of the Western Palaearctic and central Asia, than to the other southern African sandgrouse. Although sexually dimorphic, both sexes have distinctive dark chestnut belly feathers that are conspicuous in flight, along with dark brown underwings and a wedge-shaped tail. Both also have bare, blue-grey eye-rings which are yellow in the other southern African sandgrouse.</p><p>Their southern African distribution is more restricted and more localised than that of the other three sandgrouse, being confined mainly to Limpopo, northern Botswana and western Zimbabwe, with a smaller population in north-central Namibia. They live in wetter habitats than the other southern African sandgrouse, commonly frequenting short, open grasslands on deep alluvial soils (such as black, ‘cotton soils’), often near swamps and rivers.

In farming areas they will feed in burnt grasslands or recently ploughed or fallow fields. They undertake nomadic summer movements to the Ma&#173;kgadikgadi Pan in Botswana.</p><p>Although they drink mainly in the morning, they have been seen coming to water in the early afternoon in the Makgadikgadi area, Botswana, where they land a couple of hundred metres from the water and dust-bathe before wandering down to the water to drink. Although they prefer to have a beach approach to the water’s edge, they are less fussy in their choice of watering site than are other southern African sandgrouse, tolerating more shrubs and trees in the near vicinity. This may be because they are heavier than other local sandgrouse and thus less prone to attack by raptors such as Lanner Falcons. They are generally found in groups of 2-20 birds, but nomadic flocks of up to 200 are sometimes encountered. When approached, they freeze before flushing with heavy, audible wingbeats. Their call is a loud, guttural, two-syllable ‘aw aw’, given in flight. The take-off call is a harsh ‘glock-glock-glock’.</p><p>Because they live in more moist habitats than the other three southern African sandgrouse, they have a diet of more varied seed types. They also take advantage of farmlands, often feeding on the seeds of weed plants and even on waste cereal grains such as oats, wheat, barley and sorghum.</p><p>They are monogamous, solitary nesters, with a pair bond that may last at least three years. They breed during the drier months, between May and September, with a peak in June. Three eggs are laid in a simple scrape or natural depression in the ground, sparsely lined with twigs and grass. Nests are placed in fairly well-vegetated sites, particularly in weedy fields. Incubation duties are shared, with the female incubating by day and the male by night. The incubation period of 26-27 days is longer than those of the smaller sandgrouse. When an incubating bird is approached, it crouches in the nest and then walks off some distance before flushing. Unless the bird is seen leaving the nest, this tactic makes locating the nest very difficult. The chicks are shown what seeds to feed on by both parents, and the male provides water carried in his belly feathers until the chicks have fledged.</p><p>The species is listed as Near-threatened in South Africa, largely due to its fragmented population. Although there is no immediate concern regarding its conservation as a whole, its use of agricultural lands may expose it to the potentially negative influences of agriculture, such as herbicides. Furthermore, its preference for nesting on fallow and weedy lands regularly leads to nest losses when these lands are ploughed in late winter in preparation for planting.&#9;</p>",

On this and other available evidence, however, it is likely that the Yellow-throated Woodland Warbler is a regular host of the Emerald Cuckoo, but the warbler hides its nest so well that it may be a long time before more evidence of brood parasitism is recorded. &#9;</p>",

It is also presumed that Yellow Weavers are polygynous, but this has not been confirmed. In breeding plumage the male is bright yellow, and lacks any patterning around the face; the red eye is a conspicuous field character. The female is also yellower below and smaller than most of the other species in the same habitat. After the breeding season, Yellow Weavers disperse from their nesting areas and form large mixed flocks with other weavers. However, the few records of ringed birds do not suggest that they disperse over long distances. Along river valleys they may move more than 50 km inland, whereas they are usually considered to be limited to the coastal belt, and in the Eastern Cape they may be extending their breeding range inland. Ringed birds more than eight years old were recorded in Malawi.</p><p>Breeding colonies of Yellow Weavers are typically quite small, containing fewer than 50 nests. They breed in reed beds, often in association with other weavers such as Village and Thick-billed Weavers, and with Southern Brown-throated Weavers in the north of the region. The nests are oval, with the entrance below and no tunnel, small and very neatly woven, often supported by a single reed at one side. Leaves above the nest are stripped off by the male. Nests are usually placed no more than two metres above the water, and where fence lines cross rivers, nests are frequently attached to the wires close to the water. Males display hanging below the nest, and flap the wings vigorously while singing and when a female enters a nest, the male perches nearby, quivering his wings and tail. The song is not striking, an extended swizzling sound. Unused nests are often demolished. Nests selected for breeding are lined by the female with soft grass seed heads, and sometimes a few feathers – it appears that only the female incubates, which would be typical of a polygynous species. The young seem to be fed chiefly on insects.

Males were seen defending song posts like other indigobirds, and the plumage differences seemed quite trivial. It was only many years later that ornithologists in the field noticed that these distinctively-plumaged indigobirds were singing the twinspot song, not firefinch song. Only one case has been reported of a bird with this plumage type singing the song of the African Firefinch. So a new host-parasite relationship was revealed, as the Zambezi Indigobird evidently parasitises the Red-throated Twinspot in Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe and possibly the Pink-throated Twinspot in Zululand and southern Mozambique. There is little information on this bird in the field, but in captivity young were reared by Red-throated Twinspots, and the mouth markings matched those of the host. The young birds then imitated the calls and songs of their foster parent.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>The Zitting Cisticola (previously Fan-tailed Cisticola) is the most widespread representative of its genus: it occurs over much of Africa, but also in western Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India, Japan, South-East Asia, Indonesia, New Guinea and northern Australia – an impressive colonisation ability for a bird weighing a mere 9 grams and with a wingspan of only 14&#160;cm. In fact, it has deservedly been called ‘the most remarkable small bird in the world’ due to its varied life history strategies. In southern Africa it is equally widespread, shunning only the most arid western regions.</p><p>It is certainly one of the most common cisticolas in the region, and in optimal habitats such as moist grasslands, wetland edges and floodplains, it is often possible to hear males displaying overhead in all directions. Human habitat modification has been partly advantageous to this species, and it reaches high densities in cultivated croplands, irrigated fields, the margins of golf courses, weedy wastelands and so forth. Compared to its relatives, the Zitting Cisticola prefers more moist, taller grassland, typically on flat or gently sloping ground where there is a mixture of taller grass tussocks, shorter grass and open ground. Nevertheless, it is not unusual for this species to breed virtually alongside multiple other cisticola species.</p><p>It is certainly one of the most common cisticolas in the region, and in optimal habitats such as moist grasslands, wetland edges and floodplains, it is often possible to hear males displaying overhead in all directions.

Nevertheless, it is not unusual for this species to breed virtually alongside multiple other cisticola species.</p><p>The Zitting Cisticola undoubtedly ranks as one of the most characteristic and frequently encountered bird species in moist grasslands. Its unmistakable territorial song is synonymous with summer and familiar to all – whether they are aware of the songster’s identity or not. The male may sing from a grass stalk or bush, but more often does so while performing his undulating aerial display flight: rising to a height of up to 20&#160;m, he travels in a line or circle, prominently dipping every second or so; with each dip he utters a short, sharp ‘zit’, like an amplified version of a ticking wristwatch. When alarmed, both sexes give a faster, agitated version of this call.</p><p>Zitting Cisticolas forage primarily by hopping, walking or scampering about on the ground or climbing in low vegetation, where they hunt small insects such as ants, beetles, bugs, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, larvae, mantids, mayflies and moths, as well as spiders and small snails. Prey is typically 10-15&#160;mm in length, but sometimes up to about 40&#160;mm.</p><p>During the summer breeding season, they are quite approachable and inquisitive, and can even be aggressive near the nest. In winter both their plumage and temperament change: their tails become slightly longer and their colours overall brighter, and they become less demonstrative and more secretive.</p><p>Elsewhere in their global range, a proportion of males are polygynous, with each male pairing with multiple females, either sequentially or simultaneously (typically up to four females in a season, sometimes up to eleven). Every breeding season the male partially constructs several nests (up to 18 in one particularly zealous bird) and leads prospective mates to inspect his handiwork by employing different flight styles. Nests may be built at a density of 2.5 per hectare.</p><p>The nest is a unique and remarkable structure: surprisingly bulky and complicated in its architecture, but seamlessly incorporated into the surrounding vegetation. The main nesting chamber is accessed through an elongated entrance tube that opens upwards; the resultant structure is often said to have the shape of a soda bottle. It is definitely worth spending an hour or two monitoring the birds’ activities in the hope of pinpointing a nest’s location; nests may be located by watching carefully where the female disappears into the grass while carrying nesting material.&#9;</p>",

Members of this profession were known as ‘fiscals’, and they were not very popular, so it was advisable for the fiscal to wear a mask lest he be recognised by his community. In the days of the old Cape Colony, the senior judicial officer was also known as the fiscal, and was customarily dressed in black and white. This is the historic background to the common names given to two black-and-white birds in southern Africa, the Common Fiscal (shrike) and the Fiscal Flycatcher.</p><p> Both are about the same size and have similar plumage patterns, but in flight the flycatcher shows white windows in its tail; it also lacks the stout, hooked beak of the shrike. Nevertheless, one may need to look twice to ensure that the bird under scrutiny is what it appears to be, because both have similar habitat preferences (open areas with scattered trees and bushes) and they frequently occur alongside each other.</p><p> Fiscal Flycatchers are perch-and-pounce hunters like the Common Fiscal, and sometimes they act the bully towards other birds in a very shrike-like way. But a no-table difference in behaviour between the two is that the Common Fiscal is a vociferous bird, whereas the flycatcher is quite the opposite, as suggested by its scientific name. The Greek generic name Sigelus means ‘to keep silence’ (named after Sigalion, the Egyptian God of Silence), and the Latin species name silens also means silent. One could infer from this that the bird never utters a sound, but Fiscal Flycatchers do sing and they also have alarm calls, although they use their voice less frequently than do other passerine songbirds.</p><p> A pair built their nest on the top of a supporting pillar of our veranda roof. They were so secretive about it that we did not find out who was responsible until the female was incubating her three greenish blue, rust-speckled eggs. These hatched after two weeks and then both parents took turns feeding the chicks. Everything was done in silence until the chicks fledged 16 days after hatching, when they started to give trilled, begging calls. The parents also became quite vocal at this stage, giving their stridulating (grasshopper-like) alarm call whenever anyone approached the bush or tree in which one of the youngsters was perched. Interestingly, the adult male was not heard singing at any time during the nestling or post-fledging period (or even before then), so one wonders how the young birds learn to recognise and to produce their own species’ song.</p><p> There seem to be only two situations in which these flycatchers become vocally conspicuous. The usual one is when two males are involved in a territorial dispute: there is much chasing and comparatively loud (for this species) singing, especially by the current territory holder. The other situation is when a snake is seen: the flycatcher then warns with loud, rasping, strident calls, which coincidentally sound similar to the calls given by Common Fiscals when they encounter large snakes.</p><p> Fiscal Flycatchers do frequent gardens, though they seldom become as bold or confiding as other garden regulars such as Laughing Doves or robin-chats. Fruiting trees and shrubs such as the Bush-tick Berry Chrysanthemoides monilifera attract them, and they can be enticed to the bird table with offerings of bonemeal; they are also likely to check pets’ food bowls for leftovers. These activities commonly take place in complete silence, but when they go to roost at dusk, one may hear soft grasshopper-like calls coming from halfway up some thickly foliaged tree. </p>",

The most extensive wintering grounds are in Africa, but despite the very large numbers visiting, estimated at 90 million in a normal year, this bird is not frequently seen, especially in the south of its African range. The main reason for this is that they tend to feed high in the sky, often consorting with swifts. They come closer to ground only during periods of wet weather, especially when there is extensive thunderstorm activity and also with the approach of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone which rarely comes much further south than Zimbabwe. </p><p> Unlike the Barn Swallow, this martin does not roost in reed beds, rather ascending to considerable altitude to roost on the wing, drifting with the wind, usually in front of moist weather fronts. They are probably most frequently seen in mountainous areas where they can ride on updraughts of air and where aerial plankton in the form of tiny insects and spiders are carried aloft.</p><p> Our visitors come from Europe but, unlike the Barn Swallow, few birds are ever caught by bird ringers, hence there are few recoveries. Of the eight birds recovered to date there are singles from Norway, Belarus and Kaliningrad (Russia), two from Sweden and three from Finland, indicating that they come mainly from eastern and northern Europe. Birds breeding further west probably migrate primarily to West Africa.</p><p> With their preference for rain fronts, they tend to be concentrated in the moister, eastern half of southern Africa, penetrating further west into Botswana and Namibia in years of high rainfall. They tend to occur in small groups, although concentrations in excess of a 1 000 birds have been recorded. Arrival normally occurs from late September in the north of the region (October further south), but this varies from year to year. Departure takes place from March but mainly in April, with a few stragglers remaining into May.</p><p> Overwintering is not uncommon, and from time to time those birds which remain have attempted to breed at a variety of sites from Namibia, through the Western and Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal. Details are generally lacking, but one small colony did persist in the Eastern Cape for several years up to 1946. The most recent attempt was in the Garden Route National Park where two pairs successfully reared young in September/October 2012.</p><p> Common House Martins are most frequently recorded in the morning and evening. In the morning, they appear at a suitable feeding area, often in the company of other swallows, and gather along telephone lines or on rooftops, sallying forth to catch insects or taking off suddenly in a ‘dread’ (a term applied to flocks of terns and swallows that simultaneously take off in swooping flight). As the morning progresses they seem to disappear, presumably feeding far above ground. In the late afternoon, when other swallows are gathering to roost, the martins may gather again, often fooling people into believing that they are going to join these nocturnal roosts.</p><p> A well-known European ornithologist of the first half of the 20th century was fooled in this way in central Africa and wrote that this martin did indeed form a component of these huge swallow roosts. The young birds are often confused with Grey-rumped Swallows where they occur together because they both have a greyish rump. It is only when young birds complete their first moult that they attain the white rump. Both species may feed together on occasion, but the Grey-rumped Swallow is a smaller, slimmer bird with a much more deeply forked tail.</p>",

Its average mass is 5.9 grams and the lowest measured mass on record for this species is a mere 4 grams. The only similar lightweight birds in southern Africa are Livingstone’s Flycatcher, Neergaard’s Sunbird and Grey Penduline Tit, which all weigh in at 6-6.4 grams. In terms of size, the penduline tits have traditionally been ranked the smallest birds (short beak and short tail make a significant difference to total length, the original measure of ‘smallness’), but the Cape Penduline Tit is out of the running with an average mass of 7.5 grams.</p> <p> Until recently it was thought that the Fairy Flycatcher had no close relatives, and there was controversy about whether it was a flycatcher or a warbler because its attributes and behaviour provide support for both categories. On the evidence of DNA molecular data, however, it has now been placed in the family Stenostiridae, together with a mixed bag of (among others) African Eminia Flycatchers and South- East Asian Canary-Flycatchers. The Fairy Flycatcher has the type of song that is difficult to describe but is absolutely unmistakable once one is familiar with it. Very high-pitched, rather fast-paced – wispy, tinny (many adjectives have been used by different authorities) – rather like the song of a Southern Double-collared Sunbird, but quite unique – and (like the sunbird) quite loud, given the size of the singer.</p> <p> Fairy Flycatchers are most often encountered as solitary birds except during the breeding season in spring and early summer when they pair off. One of the most intriguing aspects of this species is the extent of its post-breeding dispersal. The most concentrated part of its breeding distribution is in the southern Great Karoo and the highlands of Lesotho, but in the cooler months of the year it ranges in every direction, reaching into Namibia, Botswana, and even (as a vagrant) into Zimbabwe. In the part of the Little Karoo that I am familiar with, for example, it appears in May and is present until early October, and virtually all sightings are of single birds. The exception was in October when two birds were suspected of starting a nest, but they did not persist and after a couple of days were not seen again.</p> <p> Fairy Flycatchers are restless little birds, always active and on the move, searching twigs and foliage for their insect prey, and then on to the neighbouring tree or bush to search that one. These are curious birds that can be called up quite easily by ‘pishing’, but they move off quickly. Occasionally one gives a burst of song (evenin midwinter), as though to check whether there are any others of its kind within earshot. The relentless search for invertebrate prey is probably essential for a bird of such small size because of its fast metabolic rate and rapid heat loss that results from its large surface area to volume ratio.</p> <p> But what does it do at night? Nobody has observed the roosting habits of Fairy Flycatchers. The smallest birds in the world (some of the American hummingbirds) cannot get through the night without reducing their metabolic rate and going into torpor. The Fairy Flycatcher may be just big enough to avoid torpor, but the long winter nights of the Great Karoo can be very, very cold – which might explain why so many disperse in winter.</p>",

The main breeding areas are west of the Ural Mountains, but there has been a marked reduction in the breeding range over the last 100 years or so, and there is some concern over its conservation status. The numbers present in the region fluctuate from year to year. The birds are most abundant in February in all years, but are overall most common in higher rainfall years. </p><p>Although largely absent from the most arid areas, such as the Namib Desert and Karoo, they can occasionally be seen in very dry parts, such as in the Karoo south of Beaufort West where I picked up a road-killed European Roller some years ago. In the extreme south-west of the region, its range has been expanding westwards in recent years. European Rollers are usually seen conspicuously perched on a power line, telephone pole or dead tree, very occasionally on a lower perch or below the canopy of a tree. </p><p>They are most often encountered singly, although numbers of birds may be regularly spaced along power lines in areas of suitable habitat. The birds forage from these perches, using a sit-andwait technique, watching the ground below and pouncing on any suitable prey. They also hawk insects in flight, particularly termite alates. Almost entirely insectivorous, their food in southern Africa includes beetles, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets and termites, but in their breeding areas, the birds also eat small vertebrates, such as frogs and lizards, and very rarely shrews and small birds. Like other rollers, European Rollers are attracted to bush fires and to locust swarms, where they join other birds in mixed-species foraging flocks.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>Two separate populations of European Bee-eaters visit southern Africa each summer. Most are non-breeding Palaearctic migrants escaping from the impending boreal winter to recuperate from an energetically demanding breeding season. However, there is a small population of intra-African migrants that breed in South Africa and southern Namibia.</p><p> These birds are thought to winter in tropical Africa, mainly south of the Equator, with some possibly remaining in the north of southern Africa. During early summer they can be distinguished from the non-breeding migrants by their immaculate plumage. They also tend to arrive a few weeks earlier, and unlike Palaearctic breeders, they don’t moult in the region, replacing their flight feathers on their wintering grounds. </p><p> The migratory movements in both populations are driven by the bee-eaters’ highly specialised lifestyle as aerial insectivores. They need to live in a perpetual summer, filled with a glut of flying insects. Migration allows them to capitalise on times of plenty while avoiding the relative dearth of insects during cold (and in the tropics, dry) winters. European Bee-eaters are exceptionally strong flyers, with proportionately longer, more pointed wings than non-migratory relatives. During October, large roving flocks can be seen flying overhead, with ringing bell-like calls, spreading southwards over virtually the whole of southern Africa. It is the commonest and most widespread bee-eater in southern Africa during summer, and is found in a range of habitats excluding only the driest and wettest areas. It invades the Kalahari during wet years, but is absent from this region in years of below-average rainfall.</p><p>  When migrating, European Bee-eaters feed on the wing, mainly on non-venomous insects, which they swallow in flight. They also forage in typical bee-eater fashion, sallying out from a perch to catch a flying insect. They are adept at dealing with stinging insects such as bees and wasps, bringing them back to a perch and rubbing them against it to discharge the sting. Despite the relatively longish bill, which is ideally suited to catching bees at a safe distance from the head, bee-eaters do sometimes get stung, particularly if swallowing a bee which hasn’t been properly dispatched – when studying bee-eaters, Hilary Fry often found bee stings lodged in bee-eater throats. Breeding in southern Africa is apparently a relatively recent phenomenon, with Layard documenting the existence of the first colony near Beaufort West in 1855. </p><p> The local breeding population probably is not recognised as a distinct subspecies, but as is typical of Southern Hemisphere birds, they lay smaller clutches (averaging 4-5 eggs) than Northern Hemisphere populations (6-7 eggs). They breed colonially, nesting in  tunnels in banks or erosion gullies. Their breeding range is restricted to southern Namibia and South Africa, with most nesting sites in the Western Cape, scattered colonies in the Free State, and there is a notable one in the ‘Big Hole’ in Kimberley, Northern Cape. Unfortunately the number of breeding birds has been decreasing over the past few decades, with some colonies falling foul of ‘development’. Remaining colonies need protecting to conserve this interesting population. </p><p> At the end of the rainy season, as day length shortens and the temperatures fall, the Palaearctic migrant bee-eaters prepare to return to the Northern Hemisphere. By now they have built up substantial fat reserves, and there is a concerted exodus during March. At this time large groups may be seen moving north, feeding as they go. By early May, people in Eurasia, celebrating World Migratory Bird Day, scan the skies anxiously for the return of this much loved migrant – its epic flight connects us across the world.</p>",

Because this Palaearctic-breeding migrant is so similar to the common African Reed Warbler (see comments under the latter) the puzzle pieces necessitate a bird in the hand for positive identification. The first claimed occurrence was a questionable specimen collected at Chieveley, KwaZulu-Natal, in February 1959. Between then and 1980, there were single records from Namibia, Botswana and Gauteng. In the last three decades, however, the number of records has increased exponentially, largely due to intense ringing efforts to catch swallows roosting in reed beds.</p> <p>It is now thought to occur regularly in the Bushmanland and Zambezi Region of northern Namibia. In Botswana it probably occurs in the Okavango Delta and has been mist-netted around Francistown and Gaborone. In fact, birds caught at Gaborone at night on southerly migration indicate that a sizeable population winters somewhere in South Africa. Some have suggested that hitherto undiscovered populations might be found in the drainages of the Vaal and Gariep Rivers.</p> <p>Most birds recorded in southern Africa belong to the subspecies fuscus, which is sometimes considered a different species (Caspian Reed Warbler). These birds breed in central Asia, and spend their non-breeding season in East Africa, with smaller numbers in Zambia, Malawi and, evidently, southern Africa.</p>",

In southern Africa, it has a distinctly northern and eastern distribution, and is found from northern Namibia to northern and north-eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, North West and Limpopo Provinces, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, south to the eastern Free State and Eastern Cape. Usually seen in pairs, sometimes solitary, sometimes in family groups, Tawny-flanked Prinias are common in rank grasses and tall shrubs along the edges of streams and on the edges of clearings in woodland. They appear to favour broad-leaved Burkea Burkea africana woodland on sandy soils at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, and are only sporadically recorded in the adjacent mixed Acacia woodland. They tolerate transformation to their habitat very well, and make use of tall weeds on old cultivated lands as well as tall shrubs in farmstead gardens and rural villages.</p> <p>The birds are noisy and conspicuous, and become tame and confiding in gardens. Tawny-flanked Prinias mainly forage low down in grasses, shrubs and bushes, but venture onto bare ground between tufts of grass and into the canopies of small trees in winter. Their food includes insects, such as beetles and their larvae, flies, first instar caterpillars of Mopane Emperor Moths Imbrasia belina, other caterpillars of noctuid and geometrid moths, nymphs of acridid and tettigonid grasshoppers, katydids, and nectar of aloes. They hawk mayflies and termites, returning to a perch to eat them.</p> <p>The breeding biology of Tawny-flanked Prinias is fairly well known. They are monogamous, solitary nesters, and territorial, maintaining their territory all year round, and advertising (and defending) their territory by singing. The nest, built by both sexes, is a typical prinia nest: thin-walled, oval to pear-shaped, with a side-top entrance, woven or knitted of green strips of grass leaves, and usually lined with soft grass flowers or plant down (although some nests lack any lining).</p> <p>A frequent site for the nest is attached to two or three upright stems of tall waterside shrubs, such as alien hairy willow weed, fireweed and fleabane, or indigenous reeds and rushes, and usually is about one metre above ground or water. Nests are frequently built in gardens, sometimes in vegetable gardens. The eggs are slightly glossy, variable in background colour and markings, and may be creamy buff, pink, or pale to darker greenish blue, boldly blotched, scrawled and marbled with redbrown, brown and black. Incubation is by both sexes, disproportionately by the female. Both parents feed the nestlings. They are occasional hosts of Cuckoo Finches and Brown-backed Honeybirds.</p>",

        "Body_Content": "<p>In the hand, Fan-tailed Widowbirds of all ages are easily recognised by their cinnamon-brown underwing coverts. However, this feature is of little use to most observers, as the non-breeding birds often associate in large mixed flocks with similar species. They also join large communal roosts with other weavers, bishops and widowbirds; even during the breeding season, males leave the territory to join such roosts, with only the females on the nests staying there overnight. At the end of their first year, males acquire black primary remiges, but the bill colour remains brown, and the red-and-white epaulet is not yet present. Their wings are still on average shorter than those of adult males.</p> <p>At the start of the next breeding season, when about two years old, they moult into full breeding plumage and the bill colour changes to a characteristic metallic blue. Thereafter adult males retain a bluish bill, black primaries and coloured epaulets throughout the year. They could only be confused with non-breeding Long-tailed Widowbirds, which are, however, much larger. Whereas many bishops and widowbirds perform quite brief flight displays, the male Fan-tailed Widowbird spends a much higher proportion of his time in slow, undulating flights over the territory. The red epaulet patch is very conspicuous, and experiments have shown that this patch is crucial in male-male interactions – birds in which the red feathers have been coloured black soon lose their territories during the early part of the breeding season. Surprisingly if this manipulation is done later on, once the main competition for territories is over, the altered males are still able to attract females. While flying, males produce a characteristic rolling call, quite different from the harsher, hissing song which accompanies the perched courtship display.</p<p>Intruders, including those of other species, are typically approached in flight and escorted out of the territory. If a female-plumaged bird appears, the male will fly over, and then plunge into the grass where the perched courtship display, pumping the body up and down while singing, follows, provided that the other bird also lands within the territory. During both the flight and perched displays, the tail is fanned, and other experiments in which tail length was altered suggest that this feature is important to the female birds. Up to eight occupied nests have been found in one polygynous male’s territory, so the favoured individuals can be very successful in attracting mates.</p> <p>Fan-tailed Widowbird nests are placed low in the grass, often in a tuft no more than 10 cm above the ground. The male weaves the basic framework, including living grass blades in the structure, but the bulk of the nest is contributed by the female, adding a thick lining of grass, with the seedheads protruding from the side entrance. No cases of parasitism by cuckoos have been recorded, but many nests are destroyed by predators, or even by grazing animals. The female incubates the eggs and feeds the nestlings alone. The faecal sacs produced by the young are dropped far from the nest, often up to 100 m away, which probably helps to conceal the nest location.</p>",

They feed on the ground and keep to the shrubs of forest edge, clearings within forest and treeheath thickets.

One needs keen ears to hear the birds and a lot of dedication and patience to work out what bird is responsible for which very high-pitched tweets, trills and twitters that come from low down next to the path on a forest walk.
